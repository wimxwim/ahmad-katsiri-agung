## NEVER Do (Expert Anti-Patterns)

### Physics & Ball Interaction
- NEVER parent the ball directly to a player Transform; strictly keep it a standalone `RigidBody3D` and use `apply_central_impulse()` for **realistic dribble physics**.
- NEVER allow the ball to "Tunnel" through goals; strictly enable **Continuous CD** (`continuous_cd = true`) on the ball's properties for high-velocity validation.
- NEVER scale a `CollisionShape3D` non-uniformly; strictly adjust the resource radius to preserve the internal **moment of inertia**.
- NEVER apply impulses in `_process()`; strictly use `_physics_process()` or `_integrate_forces()` to prevent visual jitter.
- NEVER use a single collision shape for characters; strictly use **layered shapes** for Head, Torso, and Legs to enable headers and chest-traps.

### Match & Team AI
- NEVER allow all AI to chase the ball ("Kindergarten Soccer"); strictly implement **Formation Slots** (Defense/Attack) where only the closest 1-2 players engage.
- NEVER use perfect goalkeeper reflexes; strictly add a **Reaction Delay** (0.2s-0.5s) and an "Error Rate" based on shot angle and velocity.
- NEVER ignore **Root Motion** for movement; strictly use `AnimationTree` with root motion to ensure momentum and turns are visually grounded.
- NEVER trust client-side goal validations; strictly require the **Authoritative Server** to validate physics and score logic.

### Implementation & Sync
- NEVER rely on the default physics tick rate (60 TPS) for fast-moving ballistics; strictly increase **physics_ticks_per_second** (e.g., to 120 or 240) to prevent tunneling.
- NEVER leave **Physics Interpolation** disabled if you want broadcast-quality smoothness; enable it in Project Settings to smooth ball transforms between ticks on high-refresh monitors.
- NEVER parent the ball directly to a player Transform; strictly keep it a standalone `RigidBody3D` and use `apply_central_impulse()` for **realistic dribble physics**.
- NEVER skip **vector normalization** on joystick input; strictly normalize to prevent diagonal movement from being 1.4x faster.
- NEVER handle contextual buttons with `is_action_pressed()`; strictly use a **ContextManager** to determine if Button A means "Pass", "Tackle", or "Switch".
- NEVER evaluate an `Area3D` goal trigger immediately; strictly `await get_tree().physics_frame` to allow the Physics Server to sync.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. The Ball (Physics Core)
The most important object. Must feel right.

```gdscript
# ball.gd
extends RigidBody3D

@export var drag_coefficient: float = 0.5
@export var magnus_effect_strength: float = 2.0

func _integrate_forces(state: PhysicsDirectBodyState3D) -> void:
    # Apply Air Drag
    var velocity = state.linear_velocity
    var speed = velocity.length()
    var drag_force = -velocity.normalized() * (drag_coefficient * speed * speed)
    state.apply_central_force(drag_force)
    
    # Magnus Effect (Curve)
    var spin = state.angular_velocity
    var magnus_force = spin.cross(velocity) * magnus_effect_strength
    state.apply_central_force(magnus_force)
```

### 2. Team AI (Formations)
AI players don't just run at the ball. They run to *positions* relative to the ball/field.

```gdscript
# team_manager.gd
extends Node

enum Strategy { ATTACK, DEFEND }
var current_strategy: Strategy = Strategy.DEFEND
var formation_slots: Array[Node3D] # Markers parented to a "Formation Anchor"

func update_tactics(ball_pos: Vector3) -> void:
    # Move the entire formation anchor
    formation_anchor.position = lerp(formation_anchor.position, ball_pos, 0.5)
    
    # Assign best player to each slot
    for player in players:
        var best_slot = find_closest_slot(player)
        player.set_target(best_slot.global_position)
```

### 3. Match Manager
The referee logic.

```gdscript
# match_manager.gd
var score_team_a: int = 0
var score_team_b: int = 0
var match_timer: float = 300.0
enum State { KICKOFF, PLAYING, GOAL, END }

func goal_scored(team: int) -> void:
    if team == 0: score_team_a += 1
    else: score_team_b += 1
    current_state = State.GOAL
    play_celebration()
    await get_tree().create_timer(5.0).timeout
    reset_positions()
    current_state = State.KICKOFF
```

## Key Mechanics Implementation

### Contextual Input
"A" button does different things depending on context.

```gdscript
func _unhandled_input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
    if event.is_action_pressed("action_main"):
        if has_ball:
            pass_ball()
        elif is_near_ball:
            slide_tackle()
        else:
            switch_player()
```

### Steering Behaviors
For natural movement (Seek, Flee, Arrive).

```gdscript
func seek(target_pos: Vector3) -> Vector3:
    var desired_velocity = (target_pos - global_position).normalized() * max_speed
    var steering = desired_velocity - velocity
    return steering.limit_length(max_force)
```

## Godot-Specific Tips

*   **NavigationServer3D**: Essential for avoiding obstacles (other players/referee).
*   **AnimationTree (BlendSpace2D)**: Crucial for sports. You need smooth blending between Idle -> Walk -> Jog -> Sprint in all directions.
*   **PhysicsMaterial**: Tune `bounce` and `friction` on the Ball and Field colliders carefully.

## Common Pitfalls

1.  **AI Bunching**: All 22 players running at the ball (Kindergarten Soccer). **Fix**: Use Formation Slots. Only 1-2 players "Press" the ball; others cover space.
2.  **Magnetic Ball**: Ball sticks to player too perfectly. **Fix**: Use a "Dribble" mechanic where the player kicks the ball slightly ahead physics-wise, rather than parenting it.
3.  **Unfair Goalies**: Goalie reacts instantly. **Fix**: Add a "Reaction Time" delay and "Error Rate" based on shot speed/stats.


## Advanced Sports Meta-Systems

Professional implementation of animation synchronization, spatial intelligence, and collision filtering.

### 1. Root-Motion-Transition (AnimationTree)
Utilize the `AnimationMixer` class (and its derivatives like `AnimationTree`) to extract root motion from complex animations. This ensures that the character's physical displacement is driven directly by the animation data, preventing "skating" and ensuring momentum is visually grounded during high-speed turns or shots.

```gdscript
class_name SportsCharacter extends CharacterBody3D

@onready var anim_tree: AnimationTree = $AnimationTree

func _physics_process(_delta: float) -> void:
    # Extract root motion from the current animation state
    var root_motion := anim_tree.get_root_motion_position()
    # Apply to velocity for physics-synced movement
    velocity = (global_transform.basis * root_motion) / _delta
    move_and_slide()
```

### 2. Contextual-Pass-Prediction (Raycasts)
To predict if a passing lane is clear, configure a `PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D` object and use `PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D.intersect_ray()`. This allows the AI or player assist to verify unobstructed paths to teammates before committing to an action.

```gdscript
class_name PassPredictor extends Node3D

func is_lane_clear(target_pos: Vector3) -> bool:
    var space_state := get_world_3d().direct_space_state
    var query := PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D.create(global_position, target_pos)
    query.collision_mask = 1 # Environment/Opponents
    
    var result := space_state.intersect_ray(query)
    return result.is_empty() # Path is clear if no collision
```

### 3. Layered-Hitbox Pattern
Configure `Area3D` nodes with specific `collision_layer` and `collision_mask` properties to filter interactions. By assigning different layers for the ball and specific body parts (Head, Torso, Legs), you can accurately detect contextual overlaps for headers, chest-traps, or slide tackles.

```gdscript
class_name BodyPartHitbox extends Area3D

enum Part { HEAD, TORSO, LEGS }
@export var part_type: Part

func _on_ball_entered(ball: RigidBody3D) -> void:
    match part_type:
        Part.HEAD:
            apply_header_force(ball)
        Part.TORSO:
            apply_chest_trap(ball)
        Part.LEGS:
            apply_kick_force(ball)
```

**Expert Tip**: For the "Root Motion" system, ensure the `AnimationTree` property `deterministic` is set to true to ensure consistent displacement across different hardware.
