# Agentic Wallet

Operate a crypto wallet through the `awal` CLI. This skill is a router: read the relevant reference file in `references/` for the task at hand.

## Preflight: Confirm wallet state

Before any wallet operation that requires authentication (everything except x402 search/details), check status:

```bash
npx awal@2.12.0 status
```

If the wallet is not authenticated, read `references/auth.md` and complete sign-in first.

## Routing

Pick the reference that matches the task and `Read` it before acting:

| Task | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Sign in, log in, connect wallet, OTP verification, "not signed in" errors | `references/auth.md` |
| Check balances, "how much USDC/ETH/POL/SOL do I have", balance per chain, JSON balance output | `references/balance.md` |
| Send USDC / ETH / POL / SOL to an address or ENS name (Base, Polygon, Solana) | `references/send-usdc.md` |
| Swap / trade / convert tokens on Base or Polygon | `references/trade.md` |
| Add funds, top up, onramp, buy USDC | `references/fund.md` |
| Find / browse / search paid services on the x402 bazaar | `references/x402-search.md` |
| Call a paid x402 API endpoint with automatic USDC payment | `references/x402-pay.md` |
| Build or deploy a paid API server that other agents can pay to use | `references/x402-monetize.md` |
| Query onchain data on Base (events, transactions, blocks) via the CDP SQL API | `references/query-onchain.md` |

If no clear match and the user wants an external capability, search the x402 bazaar (`references/x402-search.md`) — a paid service may exist.

## Shared rules

- **Input validation**: every reference lists the regexes / allowlists that user-provided values must match before being placed in a shell command. Validate strictly; reject inputs containing spaces, semicolons, pipes, backticks, or other shell metacharacters. Do not pass unvalidated user input into commands.
- **Single-quote `$` amounts**: any amount written as `'$1.00'` must be single-quoted to prevent bash variable expansion.
- **JSON output**: every `awal` command supports `--json` for machine-readable output.
- **Auth errors mean re-auth**: if any command fails with "Not authenticated" or similar, read `references/auth.md` and run the sign-in flow.
- **Insufficient balance**: read `references/fund.md` to top up.
