# Game Development Matrix (S4 — v2 capability-based)

Scenario **S4**. All asset-creation capabilities covered via the S3/S5 stacks; the structural gap is **distribution** (Steam/itch/console stores) and alternative engines (Unity/Unreal).

Schema: [`docs/cli-matrix/matrix_registry.schema.md`](../../docs/cli-matrix/matrix_registry.schema.md). Matrix plan: [`docs/cli-matrix/cli-matrix-plan.md`](../../docs/cli-matrix/cli-matrix-plan.md).

## Install

```bash
cli-hub matrix install game-development
cli-hub matrix info    game-development
cli-hub matrix preflight game-development --json
```

---

## Provider selection constraints

1. Use preflight as an availability report, not as a provider selector.
2. Treat provider order as documentation order only.
3. Choose from user requirements, output quality bar, offline needs, credential state, install cost, and provider notes.
4. Escalate to paid or metered APIs only when credentials are already present or the user explicitly consents.

---

## Preflight

Run `cli-hub matrix preflight game-development --json` first. Use the manual block below for extra probes or older `cli-hub` versions.

```bash
cli-hub list --json
python - <<'PY'
import importlib.util
for m in ("pygame","arcade","panda3d","ursina","trimesh","pygltflib","PIL",
          "pydub","librosa","music21","mido","abjad","diffusers","replicate",
          "posthog","gymnasium"):
    print(m, importlib.util.find_spec(m) is not None)
PY
for b in godot blender aseprite butler steamcmd ffmpeg pyinstaller; do
  command -v "$b" >/dev/null && echo "$b: yes" || echo "$b: no"
done
for e in STEAM_USERNAME STEAM_PASSWORD ITCH_API_KEY EPIC_DEV_TOKEN \
         PLAY_CONSOLE_KEY APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY \
         REPLICATE_API_TOKEN OPENAI_API_KEY STABILITY_API_KEY IDEOGRAM_API_KEY \
         POSTHOG_API_KEY GAMEANALYTICS_KEY PLAYFAB_TITLE_KEY SENTRY_DSN; do
  [ -n "${!e}" ] && echo "$e: set" || echo "$e: unset"
done
```

## Suggest-to-user template

```
To enable <capability> via <provider>, please set <ENV_VAR>.
  Cost: <cost notes>
  Quality: <quality tier>
Reply 'skip' to fall back to <next provider>.
```

Example: *To publish to Steam, please install `steamcmd` and set `STEAM_USERNAME` + `STEAM_PASSWORD` (use a dedicated build account to limit credential risk). Cost: one-time $100 Steamworks fee. Reply 'skip' to fall back to itch.io via `butler` which only needs `ITCH_API_KEY`.*

## Recipes

- **`godot-jam-game`** — minimal end-to-end for a game jam.
  Uses: `game.engine`, `asset.2d`, `asset.audio`, `build.package`, (optional `publish.store`).

- **`agent-bot`** — train / evaluate an agent against an existing game.
  Uses: `playtest.agent`, `telemetry.ingest`.

- **`ai-indie-short`** — AI-generated art + simple engine loop.
  Uses: `ai.gen-asset`, `asset.2d`, `game.engine`, `asset.audio`, `build.package`.

- **`steam-release`** — ship to Steam with crash reporting.
  Uses: `build.package`, `publish.store`, `telemetry.ingest`.

- **`music-driven-game`** — composed score integrated with gameplay.
  Uses: `asset.notation`, `asset.audio`, `game.engine`.

- **`reality-to-game`** — photogrammetry asset → import → ship.
  Uses: (S3 `photogrammetry.reconstruct`), `asset.3d`, `game.engine`, `build.package`.

---

## Known gaps

- **`publish.store`** — Steam/itch/console wrappers are native-only; escalate with explicit credentials.
- **`game.engine` for Unity/Unreal** — only Godot harness exists.
- **`telemetry.ingest`** — Sentry works; no first-party for GameAnalytics/PlayFab.
- **`asset.notation`** — uniquely strong (MuseScore) but rarely used in practice; keep as a differentiator.

---

## Agent guidance

- **Start in Godot** unless the user has explicitly asked for Unity/Unreal — it's the only engine we harness.
- **Keep asset pipelines deterministic** — re-runnable seeds for `ai.gen-asset`, versioned source `.aseprite`/`.krita` files, scriptable Blender bakes.
- **`playtest.agent` needs a bridge.** Most commercial games lack API access; agents should ask the user if modding is permitted before attempting.
- **Version builds immediately.** `build.package` output goes into `builds/<version>/` with a manifest so `publish.store` has deterministic uploads.
- **Don't auto-publish.** `publish.store` must always be gated behind explicit user confirmation — uploading a broken build is expensive to roll back.
