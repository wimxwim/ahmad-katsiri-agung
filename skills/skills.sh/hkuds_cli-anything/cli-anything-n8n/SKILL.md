## For AI Agents

- Always use `--json` flag for structured output
- Use `@file.json` to pass complex JSON from files
- Check return codes: 0 = success, non-zero = error
- All IDs are strings, not integers
- API key is always masked in `config show` output
- Not available in public API: data tables, credential listing, execution stop
