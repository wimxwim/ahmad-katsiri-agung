## Bottleneck Diagnosis Focus

DTC-specific bottlenecks:

1. **High CAC** → Low ad efficiency, acquisition cost eating profit
2. **LTV/CAC < 3** → Customer value insufficient to support CAC
3. **High 3PL costs** → Poor logistics choice
4. **Low repeat rate** → Reliant on new customers, high cost
5. **Low gross margin** → Cannot support ad spend

## DTC Health Formula

```
Net Profit = Price - Product Cost - Shipping - Payment Fee - Ad Spend - Ops Cost

DTC Golden Ratios:
├── Gross Margin > 60%
├── Ad Spend < 30%
├── Shipping < 15%
├── Net Margin > 15%
└── LTV/CAC > 3
```
