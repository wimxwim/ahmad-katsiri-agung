Within our application, we often want to use the same logic in multiple components. This logic can include applying a certain styling to components, requiring authorization, or adding a global state.

One way of being able to reuse the same logic in multiple components, is by using the **higher order component** pattern. This pattern allows us to reuse component logic throughout our application.

## When to Use

- Use this when the same uncustomized behavior needs to be applied to many components
- This is helpful when a component should work standalone without the added custom logic

## When NOT to Use

- When custom hooks can achieve the same result with less nesting and better readability
- In new React 18+ code where hooks are the idiomatic approach to sharing stateful logic
- When the HOC wrapper adds prop-name collisions or obscures the component tree in DevTools

## Instructions

- Create a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced behavior
- Avoid naming collisions by renaming or merging props in the HOC
- Prefer React Hooks over HOCs for most new code to avoid wrapper hell and deep nesting
- Compose multiple HOCs carefully and be aware that the order of composition matters

## Details

A Higher Order Component (HOC) is a component that receives another component. The HOC contains certain logic that we want to apply to the component that we pass as a parameter. After applying that logic, the HOC returns the element with the additional logic.

Say that we always wanted to add a certain styling to multiple components in our application. Instead of creating a `style` object locally each time, we can simply create a HOC that adds the `style` objects to the component that we pass to it:

```js
function withStyles(Component) {
  return props => {
    const style = { padding: '0.2rem', margin: '1rem' }
    return <Component style={style} {...props} />
  }
}

const Button = () => <button>Click me!</button>
const Text = () => <p>Hello World!</p>

const StyledButton = withStyles(Button)
const StyledText = withStyles(Text)
```

We just created a StyledButton and StyledText component, which are the modified versions of the Button and Text component. They now both contain the style that got added in the `withStyles` HOC!

Let's improve the user experience a little bit. When we're fetching the data, we want to show a `"Loading..."` screen to the user. Instead of adding data to the `DogImages` component directly, we can use a Higher Order Component that adds this logic for us.

Let's create a HOC called `withLoader`. A HOC should receive a component, and return that component. In this case, the `withLoader` HOC should receive the element which should display `Loading…` until the data is fetched.

```js
function withLoader(Element) {
  return (props) => <Element />;
}
```

However, we don't just want to return the element it received. Instead, we want this element to contain logic that tells us whether the data is still loading or not.

To make the `withLoader` HOC very reusable, we won't hardcode the Dog API url in that component. Instead, we can pass the URL as an argument to the `withLoader` HOC, so this loader can be used on any component that needs a loading indicator while fetching data from a different API endpoint.

```js
function withLoader(Element, url) {
  return (props) => {};
}
```

A HOC returns an element, a functional component `props => {}` in this case, to which we want to add the logic that allows us to display a text with `Loading…` as the data is still being fetched. Once the data has been fetched, the component should pass the fetched data as a prop.

We just created a HOC that can receive any component and url.

1. In the `useEffect` hook, the `withLoader` HOC fetches the data from the API endpoint that we pass as the value of `url`. While the data hasn't returned yet, we return the element containing the `Loading...` text.
2. Once the data has been fetched, we set `data` equal to the data that has been fetched. Since `data` is no longer `null`, we can display the element that we passed to the HOC!

So, how can we add this behavior to our application? In `DogImages.js`, we no longer want to just export the plain `DogImages` component. Instead, we want to export the "wrapped" `withLoading` HOC around the `DogImages` component.

```js
export default withLoader(
  DogImages,
  "https://dog.ceo/api/breed/labrador/images/random/6"
);
```

The Higher Order Component pattern allows us to provide the same logic to multiple components, while keeping all the logic in one single place. The `withLoader` HOC doesn't care about the component or url it receives: as long as it's a valid component and a valid API endpoint, it'll simply pass the data from that API endpoint to the component that we pass.

### Composing

We can also compose multiple Higher Order Components. Let's say that we also want to add functionality that shows a `Hovering!` text box when the user hovers over the `DogImages` list.

We need to create a HOC that provides a `hovering` prop to the element that we pass. Based on that prop, we can conditionally render the text box based on whether the user is hovering over the `DogImages` list.

We can now wrap the `withHover` HOC around the `withLoader` HOC.

The `DogImages` element now contains all props that we passed from both `withHover` and `withLoader`. We can now conditionally render the `Hovering!` text box, based on whether the value of the `hovering` prop is `true` or `false`.

> A well-known library used for composing HOCs is [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose). Since HOCs can largely be replaced by React Hooks, the recompose library is no longer maintained.

### Hooks

In some cases, we can replace the HOC pattern with React Hooks.

Let's replace the `withHover` HOC with a `useHover` hook. Instead of having a higher order component, we export a hook that adds a `mouseOver` and `mouseLeave` event listener to the element. We cannot pass the element anymore like we did with the HOC. Instead, we'll return a `ref` from the hook that should get the `mouseOver` and `mouseLeave` events.

The `useEffect` hook adds an event listener to the component, and sets the value `hovering` to `true` or `false`, depending on whether the user is currently hovering over the element. Both the `ref` and `hovering` values need to be returned from the hook: `ref` to add a ref to the component that should receive the `mouseOver` and `mouseLeave` events, and `hovering` in order to be able to conditionally render the `Hovering!` text box.

Instead of wrapping the `DogImages` component with the `withHover` component, we can simply use the `useHover` hook within the component directly.

Generally speaking, React Hooks don't replace the HOC pattern.

_"In most cases, Hooks will be sufficient and can help reduce nesting in your tree."_ - [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#do-hooks-replace-render-props-and-higher-order-components)

As the React docs tell us, using Hooks can reduce the depth of the component tree. Using the HOC pattern, it's easy to end up with a deeply nested component tree.

```js
<withAuth>
  <withLayout>
    <withLogging>
      <Component />
    </withLogging>
  </withLayout>
</withAuth>
```

By adding a Hook to the component directly, we no longer have to wrap components.

Using Higher Order Components makes it possible to provide the same logic to many components, while keeping that logic all in one single place. Hooks allow us to add custom behavior from within the component, which could potentially increase the risk of introducing bugs compared to the HOC pattern if multiple components rely on this behavior.

**Best use-cases for a HOC**:

- The _same, uncustomized_ behavior needs to be used by many components throughout the application.
- The component can work standalone, without the added custom logic.

**Best use-cases for Hooks**:

- The behavior has to be customized for each component that uses it.
- The behavior is not spread throughout the application, only one or a few components use the behavior.
- The behavior adds many properties to the component

### Case Study

Some libraries that relied on the HOC pattern added Hooks support after the release. A good example of this is [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react).

One way to use Apollo Client is through the `graphql()` higher order component. With the `graphql()` HOC, we can make data from the client available to components that are wrapped by the higher order component! Although we can still use the `graphql()` HOC currently, there are some downsides to using it.

When a component needs access to multiple resolvers, we need to compose multiple `graphql()` higher order components in order to do so. Composing multiple HOCs can make it difficult to understand how the data is passed to your components. The order of the HOCs can matter in some cases, which can easily lead to bugs when refactoring the code.

After the release of Hooks, Apollo added Hooks support to the Apollo Client library. Instead of using the `graphql()` higher order component, developers can now directly access the data through the hooks that the library provides.

By using the `useMutation` hook, we reduced the amount of code that was needed in order to provide the data to the component.

Besides a reduction in boilerplate, it's also much easier to use the data of multiple resolvers in a component. Instead of having to compose multiple higher order components, we can simply write multiple hooks in the component. Knowing how data gets passed to the component is much easier this way, and improves developer experience when refactoring components, or breaking them down into smaller pieces.

### Pros

Using the Higher Order Component pattern allows us to keep logic that we want to re-use all in one place. This reduces the risk of accidentally spreading bugs throughout the application by duplicating code over and over, potentially introducing new bugs each time. By keeping the logic all in one place, we can keep our code DRY and easily enforce separation of concerns.

### Cons

The name of the prop that a HOC can pass to an element, can cause a naming collision.

```js
function withStyles(Component) {
  return props => {
    const style = { padding: '0.2rem', margin: '1rem' }
    return <Component style={style} {...props} />
  }
}

const Button = () => <button style={{ color: 'red' }}>Click me!</button>
const StyledButton = withStyles(Button)
```

In this case, the `withStyles` HOC adds a prop called `style` to the element that we pass to it. However, the `Button` component already had a prop called `style`, which will be overwritten! Make sure that the HOC can handle accidental name collision, by either renaming the prop or merging the props.

```js
function withStyles(Component) {
  return props => {
    const style = {
      padding: '0.2rem',
      margin: '1rem',
      ...props.style
    }

    return <Component style={style} {...props} />
  }
}

const Button = () => <button style={{ color: 'red' }}>Click me!</button>
const StyledButton = withStyles(Button)
```

When using multiple composed HOCs that all pass props to the element that's wrapped within them, it can be difficult to figure out which HOC is responsible for which prop. This can hinder debugging and scaling an application easily.
