In some cases, we want to make available data to many (if not all) components in an application. Although we can pass data to components using `props`, this can be difficult to do if almost all components in your application need access to the value of the props.

We often end up with something called _prop drilling_, which is the case when we pass props far down the component tree. Refactoring the code that relies on the props becomes almost impossible, and knowing where certain data comes from is difficult.

## When to Use

- Use this when many components need access to the same data (themes, auth, locale)
- This is helpful when prop drilling becomes unwieldy across multiple component layers

## Instructions

- Create a Context with `React.createContext()` and wrap components with its Provider
- Use the `useContext` hook in consuming components to access provided values
- Create custom hooks (e.g., `useThemeContext`) to encapsulate context consumption logic
- Avoid overusing context for frequently updated values as all consumers re-render on change
- Split contexts by concern to minimize unnecessary re-renders

## Details

Let's say that we have one `App` component that contains certain data. Far down the component tree, we have a `ListItem`, `Header` and `Text` component that all need this data. In order to get this data to these components, we'd have to pass it through multiple layers of components.

In our codebase, that would look something like the following:

```js
function App() {
  const data = { ... }

  return (
    <div>
      <SideBar data={data} />
      <Content data={data} />
    </div>
  )
}

const SideBar = ({ data }) => <List data={data} />
const List = ({ data }) => <ListItem data={data} />
const ListItem = ({ data }) => <span>{data.listItem}</span>

const Content = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <Header data={data} />
    <Block data={data} />
  </div>
)
const Header = ({ data }) => <div>{data.title}</div>
const Block = ({ data }) => <Text data={data} />
const Text = ({ data }) => <h1>{data.text}</h1>
```

Passing props down this way can get quite messy. If we want to rename the `data` prop in the future, we'd have to rename it in all components. The bigger your application gets, the trickier prop drilling can be.

It would be optimal if we could skip all the layers of components that don't need to use this data. We need to have something that gives the components that need access to the value of `data` direct access to it, without relying on prop drilling.

This is where the **Provider Pattern** can help us out! With the Provider Pattern, we can make data available to multiple components. Rather than passing that data down each layer through props, we can wrap all components in a `Provider`. A Provider is a higher order component provided to us by the `Context` object. We can create a Context object, using the `createContext` method that React provides for us.

The Provider receives a `value` prop, which contains the data that we want to pass down. _All_ components that are wrapped within this provider have access to the value of the `value` prop.

```js
const DataContext = React.createContext()

function App() {
  const data = { ... }

  return (
    <div>
      <DataContext.Provider value={data}>
        <SideBar />
        <Content />
      </DataContext.Provider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We no longer have to manually pass down the `data` prop to each component! Each component can get access to the `data`, by using the `useContext` hook. This hook receives the context that `data` has a reference with, `DataContext` in this case. The `useContext` hook lets us read and write data to the context object.

```js
const DataContext = React.createContext();

function App() {
  const data = { ... }

  return (
    <div>
      <DataContext.Provider value={data}>
        <SideBar />
        <Content />
      </DataContext.Provider>
    </div>
  )
}

const SideBar = () => <List />
const List = () => <ListItem />
const Content = () => <div><Header /><Block /></div>


function ListItem() {
  const { data } = React.useContext(DataContext);
  return <span>{data.listItem}</span>;
}

function Text() {
  const { data } = React.useContext(DataContext);
  return <h1>{data.text}</h1>;
}

function Header() {
  const { data } = React.useContext(DataContext);
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

The components that aren't using the `data` value won't have to deal with `data` at all. We no longer have to worry about passing props down several levels through components that don't need the value of the props, which makes refactoring a lot easier.

The Provider pattern is very useful for sharing global data. A common usecase for the provider pattern is sharing a theme UI state with many components.

Say we have a simple app that shows a list. We want the user to be able to switch between lightmode and darkmode, by toggling the switch. When the user switches from dark- to lightmode and vice versa, the background color and text color should change! Instead of passing the current theme value down to each component, we can wrap the components in a `ThemeProvider`, and pass the current theme colors to the provider.

```js
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

const themes = {
  light: {
    background: "#fff",
    color: "#000",
  },
  dark: {
    background: "#171717",
    color: "#fff",
  },
};

export default function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("dark");

  function toggleTheme() {
    setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light");
  }

  const providerValue = {
    theme: themes[theme],
    toggleTheme,
  };

  return (
    <div className={`App theme-${theme}`}>
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={providerValue}>
        <Toggle />
        <List />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Since the `Toggle` and `List` components are both wrapped within the `ThemeContext` provider, we have access to the values `theme` and `toggleTheme` that are passed as a `value` to the provider.

Within the `Toggle` component, we can use the `toggleTheme` function to update the theme accordingly.

```js
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { ThemeContext } from "./App";

export default function Toggle() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <label className="switch">
      <input type="checkbox" onClick={theme.toggleTheme} />
      <span className="slider round" />
    </label>
  );
}
```

The `List` component itself doesn't care about the current value of the theme. However, the `ListItem` components do! We can use the `theme` context directly within the `ListItem`.

```js
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { ThemeContext } from "./App";

export default function TextBox() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return <li style={theme.theme}>...</li>;
}
```

Perfect! We didn't have to pass down any data to components that didn't care about the current value of the theme.

### Hooks

We can create a hook to provide context to components. Instead of having to import `useContext` and the Context in each component, we can use a hook that returns the context we need.

```js
function useThemeContext() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return theme;
}
```

To make sure that it's a valid theme, let's throw an error if `useContext(ThemeContext)` returns a falsy value.

```js
function useThemeContext() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  if (!theme) {
    throw new Error("useThemeContext must be used within ThemeProvider");
  }
  return theme;
}
```

Instead of wrapping the components directly with the `ThemeContext.Provider` component, we can extract a dedicated provider component. This keeps the context logic separate from the rendering components and improves reusability.

```js
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("dark");

  function toggleTheme() {
    setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light");
  }

  const providerValue = {
    theme: themes[theme],
    toggleTheme,
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={providerValue}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <div className="App">
        <Toggle />
        <List />
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

Each component that needs to have access to the `ThemeContext`, can now simply use the `useThemeContext` hook.

```js
export default function TextBox() {
  const theme = useThemeContext();

  return <li style={theme.theme}>...</li>;
}
```

By creating hooks for the different contexts, it's easy to separate the providers's logic from the components that render the data.

### Case Study

Some libraries provide built-in providers, which values we can use in the consuming components. A good example of this, is [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced).

The styled-components library provides a `ThemeProvider` for us. Each _styled component_ will have access to the value of this provider! Instead of creating a context API ourselves, we can use the one that's been provided to us!

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

export default function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("dark");

  function toggleTheme() {
    setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light");
  }

  return (
    <div className={`App theme-${theme}`}>
      <ThemeProvider theme={themes[theme]}>
        <Toggle toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
        <List />
      </ThemeProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Instead of passing an inline `style` prop to the `ListItem` component, we'll make it a `styled.li` component. Since it's a styled component, we can access the value of `theme`!

```js
import styled from "styled-components";

export default function ListItem() {
  return (
    <Li>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
      tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
      veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
      commodo consequat.
    </Li>
  );
}

const Li = styled.li`
  ${({ theme }) => `
     background-color: ${theme.backgroundColor};
     color: ${theme.color};
  `}
`;
```

We can now easily apply styles to all our styled components with the `ThemeProvider`!

### Tradeoffs

#### Pros

The Provider pattern/Context API makes it possible to pass data to many components, without having to manually pass it through each component layer.

It reduces the risk of accidentally introducing bugs when refactoring code. Previously, if we later on wanted to rename a prop, we had to rename this prop throughout the entire application where this value was used.

We no longer have to deal with _prop-drilling_, which could be seen as an anti-pattern. Previously, it could be difficult to understand the dataflow of the application, as it wasn't always clear where certain prop values originated. With the Provider pattern, we no longer have to unnecessarily pass props to component that don't care about this data.

Keeping some sort of global state is made easy with the Provider pattern, as we can give components access to this global state.

#### Cons

In some cases, overusing the Provider pattern can result in performance issues. All components that _consume_ the context re-render on each state change.

Let's look at an example. We have a simple counter which value increases every time we click on the `Increment` button in the `Button` component. We also have a `Reset` button in the `Reset` component, which resets the count back to `0`.

The `Reset` component also re-rendered since it consumed the `useCountContext`. In smaller applications, this won't matter too much. In larger applications, passing a frequently updated value to many components can affect the performance negatively.

To make sure that components aren't consuming providers that contain unnecessary values which may update, you can create several providers for each separate usecase.
