## Troubleshooting

If requests fail, run `zero doctor check-connector --env-name INSTANTLY_API_KEY` or `zero doctor check-connector --url https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns --method GET`

## How to Use

All examples below assume you have `INSTANTLY_API_KEY` set.

The base URL for API V2 is:

- `https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2`

Authentication uses Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

### 1. List Campaigns

Get all campaigns:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '.items[] | {id, name, status}'
```

With filters:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns?status=ACTIVE&limit=10" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '.items[] | {id, name}'
```

**Status values:** `ACTIVE`, `PAUSED`, `COMPLETED`, `DRAFTED`

### 2. Get Single Campaign

Get campaign details by ID. Replace `<your-campaign-id>` with the actual campaign ID:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns/<your-campaign-id>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '{id, name, status, daily_limit}'
```

### 3. Create Campaign

Create a new campaign (requires `campaign_schedule`):

Write to `/tmp/instantly_request.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "My New Campaign",
  "daily_limit": 50,
  "campaign_schedule": {
    "schedules": [
      {
        "name": "Weekday Schedule",
        "timezone": "America/Chicago",
        "days": {
          "monday": true,
          "tuesday": true,
          "wednesday": true,
          "thursday": true,
          "friday": true,
          "saturday": false,
          "sunday": false
        },
        "timing": {
          "from": "09:00",
          "to": "17:00"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/instantly_request.json
```

### 4. Pause/Activate Campaign

Control campaign status. Replace `<your-campaign-id>` with the actual campaign ID:

```bash
# Pause campaign
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns/<your-campaign-id>/pause" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY"

# Activate campaign
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns/<your-campaign-id>/activate" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY"
```

### 5. List Leads

List leads (POST endpoint due to complex filters):

Write to `/tmp/instantly_request.json`:

```json
{
  "limit": 10
}
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/leads/list" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/instantly_request.json | jq '.items[] | {id, email, first_name, last_name}'
```

Filter by campaign:

Write to `/tmp/instantly_request.json`:

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "your-campaign-id",
  "limit": 20
}
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/leads/list" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/instantly_request.json | jq '.items[] | {email, status}'
```

### 6. Create Lead

Add a single lead:

Write to `/tmp/instantly_request.json`:

```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "company_name": "Acme Corp",
  "campaign_id": "your-campaign-id"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/leads" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/instantly_request.json
```

With custom variables:

Write to `/tmp/instantly_request.json`:

```json
{
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "campaign_id": "your-campaign-id",
  "custom_variables": {
    "role": "CTO",
    "industry": "SaaS"
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/leads" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/instantly_request.json
```

### 7. Get Single Lead

Get lead by ID. Replace `<your-lead-id>` with the actual lead ID:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/leads/<your-lead-id>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY"
```

### 8. Update Lead

Update lead information:

Write to `/tmp/instantly_request.json`:

```json
{
  "first_name": "Updated Name",
  "custom_variables": {
    "notes": "High priority"
  }
}
```

Then run. Replace `<your-lead-id>` with the actual lead ID:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/leads/<your-lead-id>" -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/instantly_request.json
```

### 9. List Lead Lists

Get all lead lists:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/lead-lists" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '.items[] | {id, name}'
```

### 10. Create Lead List

Create a new lead list:

Write to `/tmp/instantly_request.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Q1 Prospects"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/lead-lists" -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/tmp/instantly_request.json
```

### 11. List Email Accounts

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/accounts" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '.items[] | {email, status, warmup_status}'
```

### 12. Test API Key

Verify your API key is valid:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/api-keys" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '.items[0] | {name, scopes}'
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination:

```bash
# First page
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns?limit=10" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '{items: .items | length, next_starting_after: .next_starting_after}'

# Next page (replace <your-cursor> with the next_starting_after value from the previous response)
curl -s "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v2/campaigns?limit=10&starting_after=<your-cursor>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTANTLY_API_KEY" | jq '.items[] | {id, name}'
```

## Guidelines

1. **Use API V2**: V1 is deprecated, use V2 endpoints only
2. **Bearer token auth**: Always use `Authorization: Bearer` header
3. **Scope your keys**: Create keys with minimal required permissions
4. **Custom variables**: Values must be string, number, boolean, or null (no objects/arrays)
5. **Leads list is POST**: Due to complex filters, listing leads uses POST not GET
6. **Rate limits**: Respect rate limits based on your plan tier
7. **Growth plan required**: API access requires Growth plan or above
