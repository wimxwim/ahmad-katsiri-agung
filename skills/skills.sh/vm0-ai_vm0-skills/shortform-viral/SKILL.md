# Shortform Viral

A **social short-form style**, not a fixed scene. Keep the user's subject exactly as briefed — a product, a moment, people, a place — and shoot it like a creator's phone clip below. The style supplies the *energy*; the user supplies the *what*. Tuned for **Seedance** (vm0's default video model): the prompt follows Seedance's `subject → scene → motion → camera → light → style` ordering.

## What this style is

**The essence:** feel like a real person filmed it on their phone and it blew up — **authentic, immediate, high-energy**. The goal is **relatable spontaneity and a fast hook**, not polish. It should look unproduced on purpose.

**Touchstones:** TikTok / Reels creator content, GRWM and day-in-the-life clips, candid travel/lifestyle UGC, run-and-gun phone footage.

**What makes it distinct:** **vertical, handheld, fast, bright**. The opposite of a locked tripod and a slow cinematic grade — its credibility comes from looking casual and real.

## Style dimensions (locked)

- **Visual tone — warm & natural, bright saturated**: punchy daylight, casual phone-camera look, lively color; not a graded "film" look.
- **Camera — handheld raw**: natural handheld movement, slight shake and reframes, follows the action; feels human-held.
- **Editing pace — fast cut**: quick rhythmic cuts; a strong hook in the **first second**. (Seedance can do multi-shot — use it here.)
- **Narrative mode — observational**: candid, in-the-moment; no formal narration.
- **Production type — live action**: real-world phone-grade footage.
- **Emotional tone — playful & fun**: upbeat, joyful, casual energy.
- **Style reference — short-form viral**: authentic creator content built to stop the scroll.

## Prompt construction

Write **one cohesive video prompt in your own words**, adapted to the subject. Hit these beats in Seedance order:

`subject (as briefed) → casual real-world setting → energetic action → handheld camera following it → bright natural light → playful creator vibe`

**Always convey:** vertical 9:16 phone framing · a strong action/hook right away · natural handheld movement · bright saturated casual daylight · playful authentic energy · fast pacing.

**Never:** formal studio/tripod look, slow meditative pacing, cinematic letterbox, heavy color grade, staged stiffness.

Adapt the action and setting to the subject. Put aspect ratio, negatives, and seed in the **params**.

## Generation parameters

- **aspectRatio**: `9:16` (vertical — non-negotiable for this style).
- **resolution & model tier**: pick a tier that supports the resolution — fast tiers cap lower (often `720p`); `1080p` needs a full tier.
- **duration**: `5–8s`; pack a hook + a beat or two of payoff. Multi-shot is welcome.
- **negativePrompt**: `formal studio look, tripod locked frame, cinematic letterbox, slow pacing, heavy color grade, staged, stiff, low resolution`.
- **generateAudio**: **on** — casual ambient/energy helps the authentic feel (swap for trending audio in edit).
- **seed**: mild lever for text-to-video. For look consistency use `firstFrameImageUrl`.
- **firstFrameImageUrl**: optional here — handheld energy matters more than a locked first frame; use a still anchor only if you need a specific opening look.

## How to apply

Shoot the user's subject like a creator would: vertical, in the moment, energetic, bright. If the brief wants a slow, premium, cinematic feel, this is the wrong style — pick a cinematic or product style instead.

## Worked examples

Same casual creator energy; the subject changes.

1. **"unboxing our snack product"** → hands ripping open the pack to camera, quick cuts to a bite and a reaction, vertical, bright kitchen daylight, playful.
2. **"a beach day with friends"** → friends running and laughing toward the water, handheld follow, bright saturated, fast cuts (see reference still / picker thumbnail).
3. **"a coffee shop morning"** → POV walking in, quick cuts of the order and first sip, casual handheld, warm daylight.
4. **"a sneaker drop"** → fast hook on feet stepping into frame, quick spins and angles, vertical, energetic.
