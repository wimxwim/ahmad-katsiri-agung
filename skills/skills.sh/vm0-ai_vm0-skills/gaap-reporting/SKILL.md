### Regulatory Framework (ASC 220 / IAS 1)

- Every recognized revenue and cost item within the reporting window must appear on the face or in accompanying notes
- US registrants predominantly organize costs by business function (COGS, R&D, S&M, G&A); the alternative nature-based grouping (raw materials, wages, depreciation) is more prevalent under IFRS
- Functional filers must supplement with nature-of-expense detail (depreciation, amortization, personnel costs) in the footnotes
- Operating results and non-operating activity should occupy distinct sections
- Tax expense stands alone as its own line item
- Neither US GAAP nor IFRS permits classification of any item as "extraordinary"
- Discontinued segments are segregated below continuing operations on an after-tax basis

### Noteworthy Presentation Items

- **Revenue breakdowns:** Under ASC 606, disaggregate revenue along dimensions that reveal how economic conditions influence the nature, timing, amount, and collectibility of cash flows
- **Equity-based compensation:** Allocate across functional categories on the face; aggregate total stock compensation in the notes
- **Restructuring costs:** Disclose separately when material; otherwise embed in operating expenses with footnote detail
- **Non-GAAP metrics:** Clearly label as supplemental, provide a full reconciliation back to GAAP figures, and explain the rationale for presentation

### Regulatory Framework (ASC 210 / IAS 1)

- Segregate short-term from long-term based on the 12-month horizon (or the entity's operating cycle, if longer)
- US convention sequences assets from most liquid to least liquid
- Trade receivables carry a net presentation after deducting the expected credit loss reserve per ASC 326 (CECL)
- Tangible fixed assets appear net of cumulative depreciation
- Goodwill undergoes annual impairment review rather than systematic amortization (ASC 350)
- Both operating and finance leases produce right-of-use assets with corresponding obligations (ASC 842)

## Statement of Cash Flows

### Recommended Structure (Indirect Approach)

```

Non-cash reconciling items:
  Depreciation & amortization
  Equity-based compensation
  Debt discount amortization
  Deferred tax movement
  Asset disposal gains (losses)
  Impairment write-downs
  Other non-cash charges
Working capital movements:
  Trade receivables
  Inventories
  Prepayments & other assets
  Trade payables
  Accrued expenses
  Contract liabilities
  Other liabilities
Net Cash from Operating Activities

INVESTING CASH FLOWS
  Capital expenditures
  Securities purchased
  Securities sold or matured
  Business combinations (net of acquired cash)
  Other investing items

FINANCING CASH FLOWS

  Share repurchases
  Dividend distributions
  Debt issuance cost payments
  Other financing items
Net Cash from Financing Activities

Foreign currency translation effect on cash

Net Change in Cash & Equivalents
Opening cash & equivalents
Closing cash & equivalents
```

### Regulatory Framework (ASC 230 / IAS 7)

- The indirect method (reconciling net income to operating cash flow) dominates practice; the direct method is allowed but demands a supplemental indirect reconciliation
- Amounts of interest paid and taxes remitted require disclosure (on-face or in notes)
- Non-cash investing/financing transactions (e.g., lease asset recognition, equity issued in acquisitions) are disclosed in a supplemental schedule
- Cash equivalents are limited to highly liquid instruments originally maturing within 90 days

## Period-End Adjustments & Reclassifications

### Adjusting Entries

1. **Accrued expenses:** Capture obligations incurred but not yet billed (vendor accruals, compensation accruals, interest obligations)
2. **Deferred item amortization:** Systematically release prepayments, deferred costs, and contract liabilities over the service window
3. **Fixed asset & intangible charges:** Post scheduled depreciation and amortization from subsidiary registers
4. **Credit loss provisioning:** Update the allowance for uncollectible accounts using aging data and historical recovery patterns
5. **Inventory valuation:** Write down excess, obsolete, or damaged stock to net realizable value
6. **Currency remeasurement:** Restate monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at closing exchange rates
7. **Income tax accrual:** Compute current tax payable and adjust deferred tax assets/liabilities
8. **Fair value marks:** Remeasure trading securities, derivatives, and other Level 1-3 instruments to period-end fair value

### Reclassification Entries

1. **Maturity reclassification:** Move borrowings due within 12 months from long-term to current
2. **Contra-account presentation:** Offset gross receivables with credit loss reserves; offset gross fixed assets with accumulated depreciation
3. **Consolidation eliminations:** Remove intercompany balances and intra-group revenue/expense
4. **Discontinued operations carve-out:** Shift earnings and net assets of divested or held-for-sale segments to the required separate line
5. **Equity method recognition:** Record the investor's proportionate share of investee earnings
6. **Segment mapping:** Verify that every transaction aligns with its correct operating segment

## Comparative Analysis Approach

### Computing Period-Over-Period Movements

For every material line:
- **Absolute change:** Current period amount minus comparison period amount
- **Relative change:** Absolute change divided by the absolute value of the comparison period, expressed as a percentage
- **Margin shift (where applicable):** Difference in percentage-of-revenue ratios, expressed in basis points (1 bp = 0.01%)

### Significance Criteria

Tailor investigation thresholds to the entity's scale and risk profile:

| Balance Magnitude | Absolute Trigger | Relative Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Above $10M | $500K | 5% |
| $1M to $10M | $100K | 10% |
| Under $1M | $50K | 15% |

### Isolating Movement Drivers

Break total movement into root causes:

- **Volume/quantity shift:** Incremental units at prior-period pricing
- **Rate/price shift:** Changed pricing applied to current-period units
- **Product or channel mix:** Composition changes affecting blended margins
- **New or exiting items:** Line items with activity in only one of the two periods
- **Non-recurring events:** Charges or gains unlikely to repeat
- **Phasing/timing:** Activity that shifted across reporting periods without affecting the annual run rate
- **Translation effects:** Impact of currency fluctuations on consolidated results

### Building the Narrative

For every movement that exceeds significance criteria:
1. State the magnitude (dollars and percentage)
2. Label the direction as favorable or unfavorable
3. Attribute the movement to specific drivers from the list above
4. Explain the underlying business rationale
5. Indicate whether the movement is transient or reflects a sustained trajectory change
6. Flag any follow-up actions (deeper investigation, forecast revision, process adjustment)
