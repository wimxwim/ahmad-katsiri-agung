## Template Architecture

### Required Components for Every Template

Each template in the library must contain:

1. **Label**: A descriptive, searchable name
2. **Category**: The inquiry type it addresses
3. **Applicability criteria**: Conditions under which this template is the right choice
4. **Red flags**: Scenarios where this template must NOT be used
5. **Variable fields**: Placeholders that require per-use customization
6. **Body text**: The response content with embedded placeholders
7. **Post-send checklist**: Standard follow-up tasks after dispatching the response
8. **Review date**: When the template was last verified for legal and factual accuracy

### Template Governance Cycle

1. **Drafting**: Author the template informed by current law and team practices
2. **Approval**: Legal team reviews for accuracy, compliance, and completeness
3. **Activation**: Enter the template into the shared library with full metadata
4. **Deployment**: Use the template to produce tailored responses
5. **Refinement tracking**: Monitor ad-hoc edits made during use to surface improvement opportunities
6. **Revision**: Update when statutes, regulations, or internal policies change
7. **Deprecation**: Remove or archive templates that no longer apply

## Inquiry Categories and Template Guidance

### Category 1: Data Subject Requests

Covers all requests from individuals exercising privacy rights under GDPR, CCPA, and similar frameworks.

**Variants:**
- Receipt acknowledgment
- Identity verification follow-up
- Fulfillment (access, erasure, rectification)
- Partial denial with justification

**Mandatory elements in every DSR template:**

```

### Category 2: Litigation Hold Notices

Preservation directives issued to custodians when litigation is anticipated or pending.

**Variants:**
- Initial preservation directive

- Acknowledgment requirement and deadline

**Skeleton:**
```

PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:

- Topic: {{scope_description}}
- Time window: {{date_start}} through present
- Material types: {{material_categories}}

Do NOT alter, discard, or destroy any potentially relevant materials.

**Mandatory elements:**

- Reservation of rights response

**Mandatory elements:**

## Customization Requirements

### Mandatory Per-Use Adjustments

No template may be sent without populating:
- Accurate names, dates, and reference identifiers
- Case-specific facts
- Correct jurisdiction and applicable legal framework
- Calculated response deadlines based on receipt date
- Proper signature block and contact coordinates

### Tone Calibration

Adjust register based on:
- **Recipient**: Internal colleague vs. external party, business person vs. attorney, individual vs. regulatory body
- **Relationship**: New counterparty vs. long-term partner vs. adversary
- **Gravity**: Routine matter vs. contested dispute vs. government investigation
- **Time pressure**: Standard processing vs. expedited turnaround

### Jurisdictional Adaptation

- Confirm that all regulatory citations match the requestor's jurisdiction
- Recalculate deadlines according to applicable statutory requirements
- Include jurisdiction-mandated rights disclosures
- Apply locally appropriate legal terminology

## Situations Requiring Escalation Instead of Templates

Before producing any response, scan for conditions that disqualify template use:

### Universal Disqualifiers

- Active or threatened litigation or regulatory proceeding
- Inquiry originates from a regulator, government body, or law enforcement
- The response could create a binding obligation or constitute a waiver
- Potential criminal exposure
- Media involvement is present or foreseeable
- The scenario has no precedent within the team's experience
- Conflicting requirements across multiple jurisdictions
- Executive leadership or board members are involved parties

### Category-Specific Disqualifiers

**Data Subject Requests:**
- Requestor is a minor or acting on behalf of a minor
- Requested data is subject to an active litigation hold
- Requestor is in pending litigation or dispute with the organization
- Requestor is an employee with an open HR investigation
- Request scope appears designed for discovery rather than privacy rights
- Special-category data is implicated (health, biometric, genetic)

**Litigation Holds:**
- Criminal liability is possible
- Preservation scope is contested or ambiguous
- Hold conflicts with regulatory data deletion mandates
- Overlapping holds exist for connected matters
- A custodian challenges the hold parameters

**Vendor Questions:**
- Vendor is challenging contractual terms
- Vendor is threatening legal action or contract termination
- Response could prejudice an active negotiation
- Inquiry involves regulatory compliance rather than contractual interpretation

**Subpoenas / Legal Process:**
- ALWAYS route to counsel (templates are starting frameworks only)
- Privilege concerns are identified
- Third-party data is within scope
- Cross-border production complications exist
- Compliance timeline is unreasonably compressed

### Escalation Protocol When a Disqualifier is Detected

1. **Halt**: Do not produce a template-based response.
2. **Flag**: Notify the requestor that an escalation condition exists.
3. **Detail**: Explain which disqualifier was triggered and its implications.
4. **Direct**: Recommend the appropriate escalation path (senior counsel, outside counsel, specific specialist).
5. **Assist**: Offer a preliminary draft clearly watermarked "DRAFT -- FOR COUNSEL REVIEW ONLY" to accelerate the individualized review.

## Authoring New Templates

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
- What recurring inquiry does this address?
- How often does it arise?
- Who is the typical recipient?
- What is the normal urgency level?

### Phase 2: Content Requirements
- What information is legally required in every response?
- Which regulations or policies govern this response type?
- What organizational standards apply?

### Phase 3: Variable Identification
- Which elements change per use? (names, dates, case-specific facts)
- Which elements remain constant? (statutory language, standard terms)
- Use unambiguous placeholder names: `{{requestor_name}}`, `{{compliance_deadline}}`, `{{matter_id}}`

### Phase 4: Drafting
- Write in clear, professional prose
- Minimize unnecessary legal jargon for business-audience templates
- Incorporate all legally mandated content
- Insert placeholders for every variable element
- Include a subject line template for email-based responses

### Phase 5: Safeguard Definition
- Under what circumstances must this template be set aside?
- What signals indicate the matter needs bespoke handling?
- Specificity matters: vague safeguards provide no protection

### Phase 6: Metadata Completion
- Assign template name and category
- Record version number and last-reviewed date
- Document author and approver
- Attach the post-send checklist

### Standard Template Format

```markdown
