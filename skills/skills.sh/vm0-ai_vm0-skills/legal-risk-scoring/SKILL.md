## Scoring Model

### Two-Axis Evaluation Grid

Every legal risk is measured across two independent axes:

**Impact Magnitude** (consequences if the risk becomes reality):

| Rating | Descriptor | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Trivial** | Minimal disruption; no meaningful financial, operational, or reputational consequence. Absorbed within day-to-day operations. |
| 2 | **Minor** | Contained impact; financial exposure under 1% of the relevant contract or transaction value; brief operational hiccup; no public visibility. |
| 3 | **Substantial** | Tangible impact; financial exposure in the 1-5% range of relevant value; noticeable operational interference; possibility of limited external attention. |
| 4 | **Serious** | Major impact; financial exposure between 5-25% of relevant value; significant operational disruption; probable public scrutiny; potential for regulatory interest. |
| 5 | **Severe** | Existential-level impact; financial exposure exceeding 25% of relevant value; core business operations threatened; material reputational harm; regulatory action anticipated; potential personal exposure for directors and officers. |

**Occurrence Probability** (how likely the risk is to materialize):

| Rating | Descriptor | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Negligible** | Essentially theoretical; no known precedent in comparable situations; would demand extraordinary circumstances. |
| 2 | **Low** | Conceivable but not anticipated; sparse precedent; requires specific precipitating events. |
| 3 | **Moderate** | Plausible; some analogous situations have materialized; precipitating conditions are foreseeable. |
| 4 | **Elevated** | Expected to happen; clear precedent exists; precipitating conditions are commonplace in analogous contexts. |
| 5 | **Near Certain** | Virtually guaranteed; strong historical pattern; precipitating conditions are already present or imminent. |

### Computing the Score

**Risk Score = Impact Magnitude x Occurrence Probability**

| Score Band | Category | Indicator |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 | **Baseline Risk** | GREEN |
| 5-9 | **Intermediate Risk** | YELLOW |
| 10-15 | **Elevated Risk** | ORANGE |
| 16-25 | **Acute Risk** | RED |

- Regulatory development that may affect a business line over the medium term
- IP provision that is broader than optimal but consistent with market practice

### ORANGE -- Elevated Risk (Score 10-15)

**Profile**:
- Weighty issues with a realistic chance of materializing
- Risks capable of producing significant financial, operational, or public-facing harm

## Criteria for Engaging Outside Counsel

### Situations Requiring External Representation

- **Filed litigation**: Any lawsuit brought by or against the organization
- **Government proceedings**: Any inquiry from a regulatory agency, government body, or law enforcement
- **Criminal risk**: Any scenario involving potential criminal liability for the entity or its people
- **Capital markets implications**: Any matter that could affect securities disclosures or regulatory filings
- **Governance-level matters**: Any issue necessitating board notification or board-level approval

### Situations Strongly Favoring External Engagement

- **Uncharted legal territory**: Questions lacking settled authority where the organization's position could establish precedent
- **Multi-jurisdictional complexity**: Matters spanning unfamiliar or conflicting legal regimes
- **Outsized financial stakes**: Exposure exceeding the organization's defined risk appetite thresholds
- **Specialist knowledge gaps**: Subject areas not covered by in-house expertise (antitrust, anti-corruption, patent prosecution, etc.)
- **Major regulatory shifts**: New legal frameworks that require compliance program construction or significant adaptation
- **Strategic transactions**: Mergers, acquisitions, or major deals requiring diligence, structuring, and regulatory clearance

### Situations Worth Evaluating for External Support

- **Significant contractual disputes**: Substantial disagreements over interpretation with important business partners
- **Workforce claims**: Actual or threatened claims involving discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, or retaliation
- **Data security events**: Incidents that may trigger mandatory notification duties
- **IP conflicts**: Infringement allegations (inbound or outbound) involving material products or services
- **Coverage disagreements**: Disputes with insurance carriers over claim coverage

### Selecting the Right Firm

When recommending outside engagement, prompt the user to weigh:
- Subject matter depth and track record
- Familiarity with the relevant jurisdiction
- Industry sector experience
- Conflict clearance status
- Fee structure expectations (hourly, flat, blended, contingency)
- Firm diversity commitments
- Pre-existing relationships (panel membership, prior engagements)
