# Cyberpunk Anime

A **2D cyberpunk anime style**, not a fixed scene. Keep the user's character or subject exactly as briefed — and render it as hand-drawn anime in the neon-city look below. The style supplies the *look*; the user supplies the *what*. Tuned for **Seedance** (vm0's default video model): the prompt follows Seedance's `subject → scene → motion → camera → light → style` ordering, and the look is **2D animation** (state this explicitly so the model doesn't drift to live action / 3D).

## What this style is

**The essence:** a lonely, beautiful **neon-noir mood in hand-drawn anime** — a small human moment dwarfed by a glowing, rain-soaked megacity. The goal is **atmosphere and melancholy**, the quiet feeling of a city at night, not action spectacle.

**Touchstones:** *Blade Runner*-flavored anime, lo-fi "chillhop" anime loops, *Ghost in the Shell* / cyberpunk OVA backgrounds, neon city night illustrations.

**What makes it distinct:** **2D cel animation + neon + rain + melancholy**. Not live action, not 3D CGI, not warm or natural — flat cel shading, electric teal/magenta neon, wet reflective streets, a pensive lone figure.

## Style dimensions (locked)

- **Visual tone — neon cyberpunk**: electric teal and magenta neon against deep night; glowing signage, wet reflective surfaces.
- **Camera — dutch / slow drift**: subtly tilted or slowly drifting framing; atmospheric, observational, not frenetic.
- **Editing pace — fast cut (restrained)**: can cut between moody beats; keep it atmospheric, not action-frantic.
- **Narrative mode — abstract / mood**: vibe over plot; a feeling, not a story beat.
- **Production type — 2D animation**: hand-drawn cel-shaded anime. **Explicitly not live action, not 3D CGI.**
- **Emotional tone — melancholic**: pensive, lonely, bittersweet calm.
- **Style reference — cyberpunk anime**: neon megacity OVA backgrounds, rain and reflections.

## Prompt construction

Write **one cohesive video prompt in your own words**, adapted to the subject. Hit these beats in Seedance order:

`character/subject (as briefed) → neon rain-slicked city setting → quiet motion (rain, steam, drifting figure) → subtly tilted/drifting camera → teal-magenta neon glow → 2D cel anime style, melancholic`

**Always convey:** **2D hand-drawn anime, cel-shaded** · neon megacity backdrop with glowing signage · rain-slicked reflective streets · electric teal + magenta palette · a melancholic, lonely mood · atmospheric framing.

**Never:** live-action footage, 3D CGI, photorealism, warm natural daylight, bright cheerful tone.

Adapt the character and city details to the brief. Put aspect ratio, negatives, and seed in the **params**.

## Generation parameters

- **aspectRatio**: `16:9` (cinematic anime) or `9:16` for vertical loops.
- **resolution & model tier**: pick a tier that supports the resolution — fast tiers cap lower (often `720p`); `1080p` needs a full tier.
- **duration**: `5–8s`; let rain, neon flicker, and a slow drift carry it.
- **negativePrompt**: `live action, photorealistic, 3D CGI render, warm daylight, bright cheerful tone, natural landscape, low resolution, extra fingers`.
- **generateAudio**: **on** for rain/city ambience (pairs well with lo-fi music in edit).
- **seed**: mild lever for text-to-video; for look/character consistency use `firstFrameImageUrl`.
- **firstFrameImageUrl** (strongest stability lever): generate one anime still (see *Reference still*) and pass it as the first frame — especially useful to lock a character design.

## How to apply

Render the user's subject as **2D cel anime** in a neon rain-city. Always state the 2D-anime medium in the prompt (the model drifts to live action otherwise). If the brief wants photoreal or a bright/warm mood, this isn't the fit.

## Worked examples

Same neon-anime look; the subject changes.

1. **"a lone hacker"** → a hooded figure looking down a rain-slicked neon alley, glowing signage, melancholic, slow drift (the picker thumbnail).
2. **"someone eating ramen at night"** → a lone figure at a glowing ramen stall, steam and neon reflections in wet pavement, pensive calm (see reference still).
3. **"a girl on a train platform"** → standing under flickering neon, rain outside, teal-magenta glow, subtly tilted framing.
4. **"a cat on a fire escape"** → a cat silhouetted against neon signs, rain, reflective puddles below.

| Canonical | 2D cel anime · neon megacity · rain-slicked reflections · teal+magenta · melancholic · drifting frame |

> The reference still holds the neon-anime look on a different subject (ramen stall vs. hooded figure) — the style is subject-invariant. Pass it as `firstFrameImageUrl` to lock a character or scene for image-to-video.
