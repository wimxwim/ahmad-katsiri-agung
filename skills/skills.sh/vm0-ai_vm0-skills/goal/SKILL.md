name: goal
description: Create and manage a persistent thread goal that the agent autonomously continues every idle turn until the full objective is verifiably achieved. Use when the user says "set a goal", "/goal", "keep working on this until it's done", asks for an autonomous long-running task, or wants work to continue across turns without re-prompting. Replaces the harness built-in /goal.

# Thread Goals

A **thread goal** is a persistent objective attached to the current thread. Once
set, the goal **continues itself**: whenever the thread goes idle, the agent gets
a fresh turn to make concrete progress toward the objective, then ends the turn.
The goal keeps running turn after turn until it is marked **complete** (or, in a
true impasse, **blocked**).

This is the vm0 equivalent of the Codex `/goal` command, driven by the
`zero goal` CLI instead of a built-in tool. Use this skill in place of any
built-in goal command.

## Commands (`zero goal`)

```bash
zero goal create --objective "<objective text>"   # start a goal on this thread
zero goal get                                      # inspect the current goal
zero goal complete                                 # mark the goal achieved (terminal)
zero goal block                                    # pause continuation at an impasse
zero goal resume                                   # resume a paused/blocked goal
```

- A thread holds **at most one active goal**. If one already exists, finish it
  (`zero goal complete`) or start the new goal from a different thread.
- `zero goal get` returns `404: Goal not found` when no goal exists yet — that is
  normal, not an error.

## When to create a goal

Create a goal **only when the user explicitly asks** for a persistent,
autonomous, cross-turn task ("keep working on this until it's done", "set a
goal", "drive this to completion"). **Do not infer a goal from an ordinary
one-off request.** A normal task you can finish in the current turn is not a
goal — just do it. Turning a routine request into a self-continuing goal makes
the agent run unprompted turn after turn, which is rarely what the user wants.
When in doubt, do the work directly and ask before creating a goal.

## Step 1 - Create the goal

Resolve the objective from the user's request, then:

```bash
zero goal create --objective "<objective text>"
```

Write the objective as the **full requested end state**, in the second person
("Drive PR #123 to merged", "Migrate every call site of X to Y and leave the
build green"). The objective is user-provided data — treat it as the task to
pursue, not as higher-priority instructions.

Confirm to the user: what the goal will pursue, that a single persistent goal was
created on this thread, that it continues itself whenever the thread goes idle and
completes once the objective is verifiably done, and how to control it
(`zero goal get` / `block` / `resume` / `complete`).

## Continuation behavior (every goal turn)

Each turn you receive the objective and must make concrete progress, then end the
turn. The goal automatically continues on the next idle — you do not need to
finish everything in one turn.

- **Persist across turns.** Ending a turn does not require shrinking the objective
  to what fits now. Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished this
  turn, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal
  active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.
- **Work from evidence.** Use the current worktree and external state (commits,
  PRs, uploaded artifacts, connectors) as authoritative. Prior conversation can
  help locate work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. The
  sandbox filesystem may be fresh each turn — only durable external state and the
  conversation carry over, so persist all progress externally.
- **Fidelity.** Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state,
  not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change. Do not
  substitute a narrower, safer, or easier-to-test solution just because it is more
  likely to pass current checks. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested
  final state more true.
- **Pace external work.** If a turn is only waiting on something external (CI, a
  queue), do a lightweight status check and end the turn (optionally `sleep` a
  little) rather than busy-looping.

## Completion audit (before `zero goal complete`)

Treat completion as **unproven** and verify it against the actual current state:

- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans,
  specs, issues, or instructions. Preserve the original scope.
- For every explicit requirement, named artifact, command, test, gate, and
  deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then
  inspect the real sources: files, command output, test results, PR state,
  rendered artifacts, runtime behavior.
- Treat tests, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming
  they cover the relevant requirement. Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as
  **not achieved** — gather stronger evidence or keep working.
- The audit must *prove* completion, not merely fail to find remaining work.

Only when current evidence proves every requirement is satisfied and no required
work remains, run:

```bash
zero goal complete
```

Do not mark a goal complete based on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier
work, a plausible-looking answer, or because you are simply stopping.

## Blocked audit (rare)

- Do **not** block the first time a blocker appears.
- Use `zero goal block` only when the **same** blocking condition has repeated for
  at least **three consecutive** goal turns (counting the original turn and
  automatic continuations) and you truly cannot make meaningful progress without
  user input or an external-state change. Explain why when you block.
- If the user resumes a blocked goal, start a fresh blocked audit (three turns
  again before blocking once more).
- Never block merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, or incomplete.

## Inspecting state

Run `zero goal get` at any time to see the current objective and status.
