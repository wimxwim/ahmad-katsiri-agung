# Gourmet Documentary

A **sensory food-documentary style**, not a fixed dish. Keep the user's food or craft exactly as briefed — sashimi, coffee, bread, a cocktail — and shoot it in the intimate macro look below. The style supplies the *look*; the user supplies the *what*. Tuned for **Seedance** (vm0's default video model): the prompt follows Seedance's `subject → scene → motion → camera → light → style` ordering.

## What this style is

**The essence:** make food feel **irresistible and crafted by human hands** — get close enough to read every texture, catch the steam, and feel the care. The goal is **appetite and craft reverence**, an intimate sensory moment.

**Touchstones:** *Chef's Table*, *Salt Fat Acid Heat*, high-end recipe films, artisan-craft documentaries, premium food advertising macro work.

**What makes it distinct:** **macro intimacy + warmth + the human hand**. Not a wide table scene, not cold or clinical — tight, warm, tactile, with a craftsperson's hands in the frame.

## Style dimensions (locked)

- **Visual tone — warm & natural**: warm appetizing tones, rich saturated food color, soft naturalistic light.
- **Camera — extreme close-up / macro**: tight on texture and detail; subtle slow moves (slow push or slow slide) that explore the surface.
- **Editing pace — slow & meditative**: lingering shots that let texture and steam breathe. No fast cutting.
- **Narrative mode — observational**: no narrator; the food and hands tell it.
- **Production type — live action**: photoreal food footage.
- **Emotional tone — warm & nostalgic**: comforting, sensory, hand-made warmth.
- **Style reference — gourmet documentary**: the macro, steam-and-texture register of prestige food films.

## Prompt construction

Write **one cohesive video prompt in your own words**, adapted to the food. Hit these beats in Seedance order:

`food/craft (as briefed) → close intimate setting → a craft action + rising steam/motion → macro slow camera → warm backlight → rich warm grade, shallow focus`

**Always convey:** macro close-up on food texture · visible steam or motion (a pour, a sprinkle, a cut) · artisan hands in frame · warm backlight catching the surface · rich saturated warm color · shallow depth of field · slow lingering pace.

**Never:** cold/clinical lighting, fast editing, wide industrial/canteen setting, flat desaturated color, plastic-looking food.

Adapt the dish, the craft action, and the texture to the brief. Put aspect ratio, negatives, and seed in the **params**.

## Generation parameters

- **aspectRatio**: `16:9` (or `9:16` for social food clips).
- **resolution & model tier**: pick a tier that supports the resolution — fast tiers cap lower (often `720p`); `1080p` needs a full tier.
- **duration**: `5–8s`; let one slow macro move and the steam breathe.
- **negativePrompt**: `cold lighting, clinical look, fast cuts, wide industrial kitchen, flat desaturated color, plastic food, low resolution`.
- **generateAudio**: **on** — sizzle / pour / ambient kitchen sound strengthens the sensory feel.
- **seed**: mild lever for text-to-video; for look consistency use `firstFrameImageUrl`.
- **firstFrameImageUrl** (strongest stability lever): generate one macro still (see *Reference still*) and pass it as the first frame.

## How to apply

Get intimate and warm: macro on texture, catch the steam, keep a craftsperson's hands in frame. If the brief wants a wide restaurant scene or a fast hype edit, this isn't the fit.

## Worked examples

Same warm macro look; the food changes.

1. **"latte art"** → macro of a barista pouring a rosetta, steam rising, warm backlight, slow push-in, shallow focus (see reference still).
2. **"fresh bread"** → hands tearing a warm loaf, steam escaping the crumb, golden backlight, slow lingering macro.
3. **"a cocktail"** → a slow pour over ice, condensation and citrus oils catching light, warm tones, shallow focus.
4. **"sashimi plating"** → chef's hands placing micro-herbs with tweezers, macro on the fish grain, warm key light (the picker thumbnail).

| Canonical | macro texture · rising steam · warm backlight · artisan hands · shallow focus · slow pace |

> The reference still holds the warm macro look on a different subject (coffee vs. sashimi) — the style is subject-invariant. Pass it as `firstFrameImageUrl` to lock the look.
