# Roam — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `roam-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install roam --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `roam-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/productivity/roam/cmd/roam-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for roam-pp-cli when you need to script Roam HQ from a shell or agent: tail webhook deliveries, post deploy notifications, search transcripts across many meetings at once, reconcile SCIM membership against an HRIS roster, or extract decisions from last week's recordings. The remote MCP at api.ro.am/mcp is great for ad-hoc agent chat; this CLI is the choice when you want pipelines, cron, or local-first search.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`grep`** — Search across every chat message and meeting transcript at once with --since, --from-user, --in-meeting, --in-group filters.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs to recall what was said across many meetings without re-paging the rate-limited transcript API._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli grep "pricing" --since 14d --in-group eng --json --select transcript_id,line
  ```
- **`decisions`** — Surface decision-shaped lines ("we decided", "action item", "agreed", "let's go with") from synced transcripts.

  _Use when an agent owes the team a Monday recap; deterministic and citation-bearing._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli decisions --since 7d --in-group product --agent
  ```
- **`onair-attendance-drift`** — Compare invited guests vs actual attendance for an On-Air event; print invited-no-show and walk-in sets.

  _Use when an agent is asked who didn't show or who attended without an invite._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli onair-attendance-drift --event evt_123 --json
  ```
- **`webhook-tail`** — Tail recent webhook deliveries from the local subscription registry, --since filtered.

  _Use when debugging a webhook integration without standing up a listener._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli webhook-tail --since 1h --json
  ```
- **`mention-inbox`** — Local FTS over messages.text for @user tokens with --since filter; tail format.

  _Use when an agent must surface unread mentions across all groups without round-tripping the API per group._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli mention-inbox --user @me --since 7d --agent
  ```

### Mutation safety
- **`onair-reaper`** — Find recurring On-Air events with zero attendance over N days. --apply cancels them via the absorbed cancel endpoint.

  _Use when cleaning up dead recurring events; safe by default._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli onair-reaper --stale-days 60 --dry-run
  ```
- **`scim-diff`** — Diff a CSV/JSON HRIS roster against /Users SCIM list; print add/update/remove sets. --apply runs SCIM CRUD.

  _Use when an agent needs to reconcile an external roster with Roam membership without clicking through admin UI._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli scim-diff --roster hris.csv --apply --dry-run
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`transcript-fanout`** — Run a single question against every transcript in a date range; one row per transcript with answer + citation.

  _Use when an agent must scan many meetings for a single question without re-prompting each one._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli transcript-fanout --question "did anyone mention Q3 hiring?" --since 30d --agent
  ```
- **`relay`** — Pipe arbitrary stdin lines into a Roam group via /chat.post with deterministic idempotency keys and 429 backoff.

  _Use when an agent needs to forward a stream (CI, alerts, logs) into Roam without writing a custom webhook._

  ```bash
  tail -F deploys.log | roam-pp-cli relay --to eng-deploys --idempotent-key-prefix deploys
  ```

### Reachability mitigation
- **`doctor token`** — Probe one representative GET per spec family (HQ, On-Air, Chat, SCIM, Webhooks) and print which families this key can reach.

  _Use when an agent needs to know which Roam commands will work with the credential it has before attempting them._

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli doctor token
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
roam-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Daily standup digest

```bash
roam-pp-cli decisions --since 1d --in-group standup --agent --select transcript_id,line,speaker
```

Pull yesterday's decisions from the standup group, formatted for agent consumption with citation.

### Cross-meeting question scan

```bash
roam-pp-cli transcript-fanout --question "did anyone mention Q3 hiring?" --since 30d --agent
```

Run one question against every transcript in the last 30 days.

### Reconcile HRIS roster with Roam SCIM

```bash
roam-pp-cli scim-diff --roster hris.csv --apply --dry-run
```

See add/update/remove sets before applying; drop --dry-run to execute.

### Pipe CI alerts into Roam

```bash
tail -F /var/log/ci.log | roam-pp-cli relay --to eng-alerts --idempotent-key-prefix ci
```

Stream CI log lines into a Roam group with deterministic dedupe.

### Narrow a deeply-nested transcript response

```bash
roam-pp-cli transcript-info --id <id> --json --select segments.speaker,segments.text
```

Use --select with dotted paths to keep agent context small on long transcripts.

## Auth Setup

Bearer auth via ROAM_API_KEY. Roam supports two key tiers: full-access organization keys and personal access tokens. Some HQ v1 endpoints require full-access; Chat/Transcript v0 endpoints work with PATs. Run `roam-pp-cli doctor token` to see which families your key can reach.

Run `roam-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  roam-pp-cli addr-info --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
roam-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
roam-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
roam-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.roam-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `ROAM_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `ROAM_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
roam-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
roam-pp-cli --profile briefing addr-info
roam-pp-cli profile list --json
roam-pp-cli profile show briefing
roam-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `roam-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release, then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add roam-pp-mcp -- roam-pp-mcp
```

Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which roam-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   roam-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `roam-pp-cli <command> --help`.
