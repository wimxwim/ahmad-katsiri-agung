# Render — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `render-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install render --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `render-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/cloud/render/cmd/render-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Use render-pp-cli when you need to reason about your Render footprint as a whole, not one resource at a time. It shines for env-var promotion across environments, blueprint drift checks in CI, monthly cost rollups, preview cleanup, and audit-log forensics. For one-off interactive workflows like `render psql` or `render ssh`, the official CLI is fine — render-pp-cli covers those too but its real value is the analytical commands the dashboard hides.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`env diff`** — Compare env vars between any two services, env-groups, or a service vs an env-group, three-way diff style.

  _Reach for this when promoting config across environments — it's the cheapest way to see what's actually different without click-through._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli env diff srv-staging-api srv-prod-api --json
  ```
- **`env promote`** — Copy env vars from a source service or env-group to a target with --only/--exclude/--dry-run.

  _Use when shipping a known-good staging config to prod without dragging dev-only keys along._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli env promote --from srv-staging-api --to srv-prod-api --exclude DEBUG_TOKEN --dry-run
  ```
- **`drift`** — Compare a checked-in render.yaml against live workspace state and report added/removed/modified entities by name.

  _Run this in CI to fail builds when someone edits prod through the dashboard instead of the blueprint._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli drift --blueprint render.yaml --json
  ```
- **`cost`** — Sum monthly cost across services, postgres, key-value, redis, and disks; group by project, environment, or owner.

  _Reach for this on the Friday cost-review or when finance asks 'what would happen if we downsized these three services?'_

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli cost --group-by project --json
  ```
- **`rightsize`** — For each service, fetch last --since 7d of CPU and memory; compute p95 utilization; flag services breaching --high or --low thresholds against plan capacity.

  _Run this before the cost rollup to find quick downsizing wins or services about to throttle._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli rightsize --since 7d --high 80 --low 20 --json
  ```

### Lifecycle hygiene
- **`preview-cleanup`** — List preview services older than --stale-days N; delete in bulk on --confirm.

  _Use when the monthly bill spikes and you suspect orphaned preview envs._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli preview-cleanup --stale-days 14 --confirm
  ```
- **`orphans`** — Find unattached disks, empty env-groups, custom-domains pointing at deleted services, registry credentials referenced by no service, and disk snapshots beyond retention.

  _Audit cleanup, billing review, and SOC 2 evidence-gathering all start here._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli orphans --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`env where`** — For a given env-var key, list every service and env-group that defines it with hash, length, and last-modified timestamp (never raw value).

  _First call during a credential rotation or a 'who uses this secret' audit._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli env where STRIPE_KEY --json
  ```
- **`incident-timeline`** — Merge deploys, events, and audit-logs for one service into one chronological table for a given window.

  _First command on-call should run during a 2am page after a deploy._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli incident-timeline srv-checkout-api --since 2h --json
  ```
- **`audit search`** — FTS5 search across cached audit logs by actor, target, action, and time window.

  _Use during SOC 2 evidence-gathering or to answer 'who rotated this key last quarter'._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli audit search --actor riley@example.com --target STRIPE_KEY --since 30d --json
  ```
- **`deploys diff`** — Show commit range, env-var changes, image-tag changes, and plan/region/scale changes between two deploys of one service.

  _First command in a post-deploy regression triage — answers 'what actually changed'._

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli deploys diff srv-checkout-api dep-aaa dep-bbb --json
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
render-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Promote staging env to prod, exclude debug keys

```bash
render-pp-cli env promote --from srv-staging --to srv-prod --exclude DEBUG_TOKEN,SENTRY_DEV_DSN
```

First diff to see what would change, then promote with the dev-only keys filtered out. Add --apply after review to actually issue the writes.

### Find every service that uses a secret before rotating it

```bash
render-pp-cli env where STRIPE_KEY --json --select 'service.name,service.id,updatedAt'
```

Returns service names, IDs, and timestamps for every place STRIPE_KEY is referenced — your rotation checklist.

### Friday cost rollup grouped by project

```bash
render-pp-cli cost --group-by project --json --select 'project,monthly_usd,resource_count'
```

Joins cached service/postgres/kv/disk plans against a curated price table; export to CSV for finance.

### Detect blueprint drift in CI

```bash
render-pp-cli drift --blueprint render.yaml --json --quiet || exit 1
```

Exits non-zero when the live workspace diverges from the checked-in blueprint; wire it into your CI pipeline.

### Incident timeline for a service over the last 2 hours

```bash
render-pp-cli incident-timeline srv-checkout-api --since 2h --json --select 'timestamp,kind,actor,summary'
```

Merges deploys + events + audit-logs into one chronological table — answers 'what changed' during an on-call page.

## Auth Setup

Render uses bearer-token auth. Set RENDER_API_KEY (generate one at https://dashboard.render.com/u/settings#api-keys), or run `render-pp-cli auth set-token <RENDER_API_KEY>` to paste it interactively. Every command sends `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; doctor verifies the key is live.

Run `render-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  render-pp-cli blueprints list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
render-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
render-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
render-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.render-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `RENDER_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `RENDER_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
render-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
render-pp-cli --profile briefing blueprints list
render-pp-cli profile list --json
render-pp-cli profile show briefing
render-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Async Jobs

For endpoints that submit long-running work, the generator detects the submit-then-poll pattern (a `job_id`/`task_id`/`operation_id` field in the response plus a sibling status endpoint) and wires up three extra flags on the submitting command:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--wait` | Block until the job reaches a terminal status instead of returning the job ID immediately |
| `--wait-timeout` | Maximum wait duration (default 10m, 0 means no timeout) |
| `--wait-interval` | Initial poll interval (default 2s; grows with exponential backoff up to 30s) |

Use async submission without `--wait` when you want to fire-and-forget; use `--wait` when you want one command to return the finished artifact.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `render-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release, then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add render-pp-mcp -- render-pp-mcp
```

Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which render-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   render-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `render-pp-cli <command> --help`.
