# Shopify — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `shopify-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install shopify --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `shopify-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/shopify/cmd/shopify-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When Not to Use This CLI

Do not activate this CLI for requests that require creating, updating, deleting, publishing, commenting, upvoting, inviting, ordering, sending messages, booking, purchasing, or changing remote state. This printed CLI exposes read-only commands for inspection, export, sync, and analysis.

## Freshness Contract

This printed CLI owns bounded freshness only for registered store-backed read command paths. In `--data-source auto` mode, those paths check `sync_state` and may run a bounded refresh before reading local data. `--data-source local` never refreshes. `--data-source live` reads the API and does not mutate the local store. Set `SHOPIFY_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` to skip the freshness hook without changing source selection.

Covered paths:

- `shopify-pp-cli abandoned-checkouts`
- `shopify-pp-cli abandoned-checkouts get`
- `shopify-pp-cli abandoned-checkouts list`
- `shopify-pp-cli abandoned-checkouts search`
- `shopify-pp-cli customers`
- `shopify-pp-cli customers get`
- `shopify-pp-cli customers list`
- `shopify-pp-cli customers search`
- `shopify-pp-cli fulfillment-orders`
- `shopify-pp-cli fulfillment-orders get`
- `shopify-pp-cli fulfillment-orders list`
- `shopify-pp-cli fulfillment-orders search`
- `shopify-pp-cli inventory-items`
- `shopify-pp-cli inventory-items get`
- `shopify-pp-cli inventory-items list`
- `shopify-pp-cli inventory-items search`
- `shopify-pp-cli orders`
- `shopify-pp-cli orders get`
- `shopify-pp-cli orders list`
- `shopify-pp-cli orders search`
- `shopify-pp-cli products`
- `shopify-pp-cli products get`
- `shopify-pp-cli products list`
- `shopify-pp-cli products search`

When JSON output uses the generated provenance envelope, freshness metadata appears at `meta.freshness`. Treat it as current-cache freshness for the covered command path, not a guarantee of complete historical backfill or API-specific enrichment.

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
shopify-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Hand-written Extensions

These commands are declared by the spec author and require separate hand-written wiring; the generator does not emit Cobra registration for them. They are listed here for discoverability and are intentionally outside `## Command Reference` so the verify-skill unknown-command check does not treat them as generator-owned paths.

- `shopify-pp-cli bulk-operations` — Run, poll, and inspect Shopify Admin GraphQL bulk operations.
- `shopify-pp-cli store daily-brief` — Executive daily brief with revenue, top products, risk checks, and suggested actions from the local store.
- `shopify-pp-cli store audit` — Health score from refunds, fulfillment risk, shipping anomalies, and dead stock.
- `shopify-pp-cli growth campaign-brief` — Data-backed campaign brief from top products, VIPs, and winback opportunities.
- `shopify-pp-cli growth winback-candidates` — Rank idle customers by lifetime value and suggested winback angle.
- `shopify-pp-cli growth vip-segments` — Segment high-value customers by spend, frequency, and recency.
- `shopify-pp-cli ops fulfillment-risk` — Find open fulfillment orders older than a threshold.
- `shopify-pp-cli ops shipping-anomalies` — Find free/missing/high shipping charges from synced shipping lines.
- `shopify-pp-cli merchandising bundle-opportunities` — Suggest bundles from co-purchase lift and confidence.
- `shopify-pp-cli merchandising dead-stock-actions` — Turn stock with no recent sales into markdown/bundle actions.
- `shopify-pp-cli merchandising launch-brief` — Build a launch/relaunch brief for a product from local evidence.

## Auth Setup
Run `shopify-pp-cli auth setup` to print the URL and steps for getting a key (add `--launch` to open the URL). Then set:

```bash
export SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your-key>"
```

Or persist it in `~/.config/shopify-pp-cli/config.toml`.

Run `shopify-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  shopify-pp-cli abandoned-checkouts list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Read-only** — do not use this CLI for create, update, delete, publish, comment, upvote, invite, order, send, or other mutating requests

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set — piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
shopify-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
shopify-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
shopify-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/shopify-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `SHOPIFY_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `SHOPIFY_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
shopify-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
shopify-pp-cli --profile briefing abandoned-checkouts list
shopify-pp-cli profile list --json
shopify-pp-cli profile show briefing
shopify-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `shopify-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/shopify/cmd/shopify-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add shopify-pp-mcp -- shopify-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which shopify-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   shopify-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `shopify-pp-cli <command> --help`.
