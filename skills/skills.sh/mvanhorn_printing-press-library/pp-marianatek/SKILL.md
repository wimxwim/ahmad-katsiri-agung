# Mariana Tek — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `marianatek-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install marianatek --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `marianatek-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/productivity/marianatek/cmd/marianatek-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Use marianatek whenever a user wants to discover, book, or track classes at any Mariana Tek-powered studio. It is especially valuable for multi-tenant members who book across several brands, for cancellation hunters who need a real waitlist mechanism, and for agentic schedulers that need a machine-readable booking surface. The MCP server exposes every read-only command for agent use; mutating commands are guarded with --dry-run.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cancellation hunting
- **`watch`** — Poll a sold-out class (or a filter) and emit a structured event the moment a spot opens — optionally auto-book in the same tick.

  _Reach for this whenever the user wants a sold-out class. NDJSON output lets the agent decide what to do on cancellation events._

  ```bash
  marianatek watch 84212 --interval 60s --auto-book --agent
  ```
- **`book-regular`** — Resolve a natural slot key ('tue-7am-vinyasa') against the regulars table, find the next matching upcoming class, and book it.

  _The agent shorthand for repeat-booking workflows. Pair with regulars to discover the slot keys this user has._

  ```bash
  marianatek book-regular --slot "tue-7am-vinyasa" --auto --agent
  ```

### Multi-tenant power
- **`schedule`** — Query the merged class catalog across every tenant you have logged into, with structured filters that the per-tenant iframe widget cannot offer.

  _When a user belongs to multiple studios, this is the only way to see all options at once. Always pair with --select to keep the response narrow._

  ```bash
  marianatek schedule --any-tenant --type vinyasa --before 07:00 --window 7d --agent --select tenant,location,start_time,instructor
  ```
- **`conflicts`** — Read reservations across all logged-in tenants, optionally pull an exported ICS calendar, and flag overlapping intervals or insufficient buffer.

  _Critical for multi-tenant users with packed calendars. Use --buffer to enforce minimum gap between back-to-back sessions._

  ```bash
  marianatek conflicts 2026-05-15 --ics ~/Downloads/calendar.ics --buffer 30m --agent
  ```
- **`search`** — Full-text search across cached class sessions, instructors, locations, and class types — ranks by BM25 and respects --any-tenant.

  _Use when the user's request is fuzzy. Always emit --select-narrowed output so you can fit several results in context._

  ```bash
  marianatek search "vinyasa soho morning" --agent --select tenant,start_time,instructor,location,spots_left
  ```

### Personal insights
- **`regulars`** — Group your local reservation history by instructor, class type, time-of-day, day-of-week, or location and rank the dimensions you actually use.

  _Use this to ground recommendations in what the user actually does, rather than what the API thinks they like._

  ```bash
  marianatek regulars --by instructor --top 5 --agent
  ```
- **`expiring`** — Surface credit packs and memberships about to lapse, with remaining balance and the classes that would consume them best.

  _Pre-empt wasted credits. Run as a weekly cron; if non-empty, the user has action to take._

  ```bash
  marianatek expiring --within 720h --agent
  ```

### Operations
- **`doctor`** — Per-tenant token expiry, last-sync timestamp, row counts, and a live class-probe for reachability.

  _Run before any cron job or watch session. If any tenant is in 'expired' state, refresh tokens before scheduling._

  ```bash
  marianatek doctor --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
marianatek-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Find an open vinyasa morning slot across every studio you belong to

```bash
marianatek search "vinyasa morning" --any-tenant --agent --select tenant,start_time,location,instructor,spots_left
```

FTS5 ranks matches across the local cache; --select keeps the response shape narrow so the agent can fit several results in context.

### Watch a sold-out class and auto-book on cancellation

```bash
marianatek watch 84212 --interval 60s --auto-book --agent
```

Streams NDJSON events. The first --auto-book success emits a confirmed-reservation event and the command exits 0.

### List credit packs that expire in the next 30 days

```bash
marianatek expiring --within 720h --agent --select tenant,expires_at,remaining,suggested_classes
```

Joins balance + expiry + candidate class costs. --select trims to the fields an agent uses to recommend an action.

### Find your top 5 instructors by reservation count

```bash
marianatek regulars --by instructor --top 5 --agent
```

Groups local reservations by instructor; outputs counts, last-booked date, and the most common location/time pairing.

### Detect calendar conflicts across studios for a given day

```bash
marianatek conflicts 2026-05-15 --ics ~/Downloads/calendar.ics --buffer 30m --agent
```

Reads reservations across every logged-in tenant, optionally an exported ICS, flags overlaps + sub-buffer pairs. Run before confirming back-to-back bookings.

## Auth Setup

Each tenant is its own brand subdomain ({tenant}.marianatek.com), so authentication is per-tenant. Run `marianatek login --tenant kolmkontrast` to launch the OAuth2 Authorization Code flow in your browser; the refresh token lands at `~/.config/marianatek/<tenant>.token.json` (0600). The HTTP client transparently refreshes on 401. For headless / CI use, `marianatek login --tenant <slug> --email --password` performs an OAuth2 password grant. Logout with `marianatek logout --tenant <slug>` deletes the token file.

Run `marianatek-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  marianatek-pp-cli app-version-metadatas list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
marianatek-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
marianatek-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
marianatek-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.marianatek-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `MARIANATEK_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `MARIANATEK_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
marianatek-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
marianatek-pp-cli --profile briefing app-version-metadatas list
marianatek-pp-cli profile list --json
marianatek-pp-cli profile show briefing
marianatek-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `marianatek-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release, then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add marianatek-pp-mcp -- marianatek-pp-mcp
```

Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which marianatek-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   marianatek-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `marianatek-pp-cli <command> --help`.
