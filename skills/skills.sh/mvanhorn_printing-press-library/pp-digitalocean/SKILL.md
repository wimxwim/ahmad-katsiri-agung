# Digitalocean — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `digitalocean-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install digitalocean --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `digitalocean-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/cloud/digitalocean/cmd/digitalocean-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`workflow archive`** — Sync DigitalOcean resources into a local SQLite store for offline inspection and repeatable agent workflows.

  _Gives agents a durable local inventory before planning cloud changes._

  ```bash
  digitalocean-pp-cli workflow archive --full --json
  ```
- **`search`** — Search synced DigitalOcean data locally, with live/local source selection for agent-friendly retrieval.

  _Lets agents locate relevant resources before choosing a narrower command._

  ```bash
  digitalocean-pp-cli search "production" --data-source local --json --limit 20
  ```

### Operational summaries
- **`analytics`** — Summarize locally synced resource data with count and group-by operations.

  _Turns resource listings into operational summaries an agent can reason about._

  ```bash
  digitalocean-pp-cli analytics --type droplets --group-by region --json
  ```
- **`tail`** — Poll selected resources and emit change events as NDJSON for shell and agent pipelines.

  _Provides a safe one-shot or continuous change feed without bespoke scripts._

  ```bash
  digitalocean-pp-cli tail --resource droplets --interval 30s --json
  ```

These can be things like rebooting a Droplet, or transferring an image to a new region.

An action object is created every time one of these actions is initiated. The action
object contains information about the current status of the action, start and complete
timestamps, and the associated resource type and ID.

Every action that creates an action object is available through this endpoint. Completed
actions are not removed from this list and are always available for querying.

**Note:** You can pass the following HTTP header with the request to have the API return
the `reserved_ips` stanza instead of the `floating_ips` stanza:

- `Accept: application/vnd.digitalocean.reserveip+json`

- `digitalocean-pp-cli actions get` — Get
- `digitalocean-pp-cli actions list` — List

**add-ons** — Add-ons are third-party applications that can be added to your DigitalOcean account.
They are available through the [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/).
Add-ons can be used to enhance the functionality of your existing resources or to provide
additional services.

The Add-Ons API allows you to manage these resources, including creating, listing, and retrieving
details about specific add-on resources.

**apps** — App Platform is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from DigitalOcean that allows
developers to publish code directly to DigitalOcean servers without worrying about the
underlying infrastructure.

Most API operations are centered around a few core object types. Following are the
definitions of these types. These definitions will be omitted from the operation-specific
documentation.

For documentation on app specifications (`AppSpec` objects), please refer to the
[product documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/app-spec/)).

**billing** — The billing endpoints allow you to retrieve your account balance, invoices,
billing history, and insights.

**Balance:** By sending requests to the `/v2/customers/my/balance` endpoint, you can
retrieve the balance information for the requested customer account.

**Invoices:** [Invoices](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/billing/invoices/)
are generated on the first of each month for every DigitalOcean
customer. An invoice preview is generated daily, which can be accessed
with the `preview` keyword in place of `$INVOICE_UUID`. To interact with
invoices, you will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at
`/v2/customers/my/invoices`.

**Billing History:** Billing history is a record of billing events for your account.
For example, entries may include events like payments made, invoices
issued, or credits granted. To interact with invoices, you
will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at
`/v2/customers/my/billing_history`.

**Billing Insights:** Day-over-day changes in billing resource usage based on nightly invoice items,
including total amount, region, SKU, and description for a specified date range.
It is important to note that the daily resource usage may not reflect month-end billing totals when totaled for
a given month as nightly invoice items do not necessarily encompass all invoicing factors for the entire month.
  `v2/billing/{account_urn}/insights/{start_date}/{end_date}` where account_urn is the URN of the customer
account, can be a team (do:team:uuid) or an organization (do:teamgroup:uuid). The date range specified by
start_date and end_date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.


**byoip-prefixes** — Bring your own IP (BYOIP) lets you provision your own IPv4 network prefixes
to your account, then assign those IPs to your DigitalOcean resources.
BYOIP supports the following features:
* IPv4 addresses
* Network sizes of anywhere from `/24` (256 addresses) to `/18` (16,384 addresses)
* Same API and management interface as our existing reserved IPs feature
* Assignable to Droplets only

two types of [SSL certificate management](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/manage-certificates):

* **Custom**: User-generated certificates may be uploaded to DigitalOcean
where they will be placed in a fully encrypted and isolated storage system.

* **Let's Encrypt**: Certificates may be automatically generated by

**databases** — DigitalOcean's [managed database service](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases)
simplifies the creation and management of highly available database clusters. Currently, it
offers support for [PostgreSQL](http://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/),
[Caching](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/redis/),
[Valkey](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/valkey/),
[MySQL](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mysql/),
[MongoDB](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/mongodb/), and
[OpenSearch](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/opensearch/).

By sending requests to the `/v2/databases` endpoint, you can list, create, or delete
database clusters as well as scale the size of a cluster, add or remove read-only replicas,
and manage other configuration details.

Database clusters may be deployed in a multi-node, high-availability configuration.
If your machine type is above the basic nodes, your node plan is above the smallest option,
or you are running MongoDB, you may additionally include up to two standby nodes in your cluster.

The size of individual nodes in a database cluster is represented by a human-readable slug,
which is used in some of the following requests. Each slug denotes the node's identifier,
CPU count, and amount of RAM, in that order.

For a list of currently available database slugs and options, use the `/v2/databases/options` endpoint or use the
`doctl databases options` [command](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/reference/databases/options).

virtual machine. By sending requests to the Droplet endpoint, you can
list, create, or delete Droplets.

Some of the attributes will have an object value. The `region` and `image`
objects will all contain the standard attributes of their associated
types. Find more information about each of these objects in their

**floating-ips** — As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the Floating IP product to [Reserved IPs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Reserved-IPs).
The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as Floating IPs.
The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields.
For example, the `floating_ips` field is now the `reserved_ips` field.
The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being
permanently deprecated.

With the exception of the [Projects API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Projects),
we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API
where the `floating_ip` field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response
will contain the field `reserved_ips` in addition to the `floating_ips` field.
Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.

[DigitalOcean Floating IPs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/)
are publicly-accessible static IP addresses that can be mapped to one of
your Droplets. They can be used to create highly available setups or other
configurations requiring movable addresses.

Floating IPs are bound to a specific region.

**images** — A DigitalOcean [image](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/images/) can be
used to create a Droplet and may come in a number of flavors. Currently,
there are five types of images: snapshots, backups, applications,
distributions, and custom images.

* [Snapshots](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/snapshots/) provide
a full copy of an existing Droplet instance taken on demand.

* [Backups](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/backups/) are similar
to snapshots but are created automatically at regular intervals when
enabled for a Droplet.

* [Custom images](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/custom-images/)
are Linux-based virtual machine images (raw, qcow2, vhdx, vdi, and vmdk
formats are supported) that you may upload for use on DigitalOcean.

* Distributions are the public Linux distributions that are available to
be used as a base to create Droplets.

* Applications, or [1-Click Apps](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/),
are distributions pre-configured with additional software.

**reserved-ips** — As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the [Floating IP](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Floating-IPs)
product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact
same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the
URLs and fields. For example, the `floating_ips` field is now the `reserved_ips` field.
The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being
permanently deprecated.

With the exception of the [Projects API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Projects),
we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API
where the `floating_ip` field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response
will contain the field `reserved_ips` in addition to the `floating_ips` field.
Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.

DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IP addresses that can be
mapped to one of your Droplets. They can be used to create highly available
setups or other configurations requiring movable addresses.

Reserved IPs are bound to a specific region.

**sizes** — The sizes objects represent different packages of hardware resources that
can be used for Droplets. When a Droplet is created, a size must be
selected so that the correct resources can be allocated.

Each size represents a plan that bundles together specific sets of
resources. This includes the amount of RAM, the number of virtual CPUs,
disk space, and transfer. The size object also includes the pricing
details and the regions that the size is available in.

- `digitalocean-pp-cli sizes` — List

**snapshots** — [Snapshots](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/snapshots/) are saved
instances of a Droplet or a block storage volume, which is reflected in
the `resource_type` attribute. In order to avoid problems with compressing
filesystems, each defines a `min_disk_size` attribute which is the minimum
size of the Droplet or volume disk when creating a new resource from the
saved snapshot.

To interact with snapshots, you will generally send requests to the
snapshots endpoint at `/v2/snapshots`.

**tags** — A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets,
Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in order to
better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.

Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an embedded
`resources` attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
digitalocean-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Auth Setup

Store your access token:

```bash
digitalocean-pp-cli auth set-token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Or set `DIGITALOCEAN_BEARER_AUTH` as an environment variable.

Run `digitalocean-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  digitalocean-pp-cli 1-clicks list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
digitalocean-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
digitalocean-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
digitalocean-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.digitalocean-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `DIGITALOCEAN_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `DIGITALOCEAN_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
digitalocean-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
digitalocean-pp-cli --profile briefing 1-clicks list
digitalocean-pp-cli profile list --json
digitalocean-pp-cli profile show briefing
digitalocean-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `digitalocean-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/cloud/digitalocean/cmd/digitalocean-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add digitalocean-pp-mcp -- digitalocean-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which digitalocean-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   digitalocean-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `digitalocean-pp-cli <command> --help`.
