# Stripe — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `stripe-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install stripe --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `stripe-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/stripe/cmd/stripe-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for stripe-pp-cli when you need to (1) run analytics across customers/subs/invoices that Stripe's dashboard doesn't expose, (2) script payment ops in a CI/agent loop without daemon processes, (3) reconcile payouts and balance transactions, or (4) feed Stripe state into a non-Stripe system (CRM, accounting, outreach automation).

## When NOT to Use This CLI (anti-triggers)

Do not use stripe-pp-cli for:

- **Live-mode bulk writes you have not audited.** Mutating commands (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) against an `sk_live_...` key are blocked by default with a clear error; pass `--confirm-live` (or set `STRIPE_CONFIRM_LIVE=1`) once you have audited the invocation. Prefer `sk_test_...` for development regardless.
- **In-person Terminal payments.** `terminal` resource commands are present but Stripe Terminal SDK is not in scope. Use the Terminal iOS/Android SDK.
- **Stripe Issuing card management workflows.** `issuing` commands are REST passthrough only; spending controls, dispute evidence packages not built. Use the Stripe Dashboard.
- **Stripe Tax registration.** `tax-rates` CRUD only; jurisdiction registration not in scope. Use Stripe Tax in Dashboard.
- **Connect platform fan-out across many connected accounts.** Single account at a time via `Stripe-Account` header. Multi-account loops via external script.
- **Local mock-server testing.** Use [stripe-mock](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mock) directly via `STRIPE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:12111`.

## Not Yet Wired (deferred to v0.2)

| Area | Status | Workaround |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Stripe Issuing (full workflow) | endpoint passthrough only | Use Stripe Dashboard |
| Stripe Terminal (in-person SDK) | endpoint passthrough only | Use Terminal SDK |
| Stripe Tax registration | `tax-rates` CRUD only | Use Stripe Tax in Dashboard |
| `localstripe` mock server | out of scope | Use `stripe-mock` via `STRIPE_BASE_URL` |
| Connect account fan-out | single-account at a time | External script loops |

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`health`** — Compute a 0-100 health score for one or many customers from local SQLite, factoring in failed-payment count, dispute history, MRR contribution, subscription status, and account age.

  _Use this to feed customer-health signals into outreach, dunning, and renewal automation without burning hundreds of API calls per customer._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli health cus_xyz --json --select score,failed_payments,mrr_contribution
  ```
- **`dunning-queue`** — List invoices in past_due/uncollectible state ranked by days-overdue, with last failure reason and customer email pulled from the local store.

  _When deciding which customers to follow up with about failed payments, this beats walking the Stripe dashboard or chaining 4+ API calls per row._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli dunning-queue --json --select invoice,customer_email,days_overdue,last_failure_reason
  ```
- **`sql`** — Run read-only SQLite queries against the local Stripe mirror. All synced data lives in a generic 'resources' table — query with json_extract(data, '$.field') and filter by resource_type.

  _When a one-off question doesn't fit the canned commands, drop into SQL instead of writing a script that hits the API a thousand times._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli sql "SELECT json_extract(data,'$.email') AS email, COUNT(*) AS active_subs FROM resources WHERE resource_type='subscriptions' AND json_extract(data,'$.status')='active' GROUP BY json_extract(data,'$.customer') HAVING active_subs > 1" --json
  ```
- **`payout-reconcile`** — Join payouts to balance_transactions to charges to customers from local store; flag missing balance_transactions and mismatches; CSV export.

  _Use this for end-of-period payout reconciliation against bank statements or accounting systems — replaces the manual CSV-pivot ritual._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli payout-reconcile --since 7d --csv
  ```
- **`subs-at-risk`** — List subscriptions whose default payment method's card expires in a window, sorted by current MRR contribution.

  _Use this monthly to proactively email customers whose card is about to expire — prevents involuntary churn._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli subs-at-risk --within 30d --json --select customer_email,mrr,card_exp
  ```
- **`metadata-grep`** — Search every synced resource's metadata bag for a key/value across resource types; returns (resource_type, id, matched_kv) rows.

  _When integrating Stripe with a CRM via metadata tags, this finds every related resource in one query._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli metadata-grep 'crm_id=acme-001' --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`customer-360`** — One-shot dossier: customer profile + active subs + recent invoices + payment methods + recent charges + open disputes + lifetime spend.

  _Use this as the first command when investigating a customer ticket, support escalation, or churn risk — full context in one call._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli customer-360 alice@example.com --json --compact
  ```
- **`events-since`** — Fetch all Events since a cursor, persist new cursor in profile, no daemon. One-shot replacement for stripe-cli's listen daemon.

  _Use this in cron-driven agent loops to replay only new events since the last run — no daemon to babysit, no missed events._

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli events-since --type 'invoice.*' --json --select id,type,created,data.object.id
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
stripe-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Find double-subscribed customers

```bash
stripe-pp-cli sql 'SELECT json_extract(s.data,"$.customer") AS cid, COUNT(*) AS subs FROM resources s WHERE s.resource_type="subscriptions" AND json_extract(s.data,"$.status")="active" GROUP BY cid HAVING subs > 1' --json
```

All Stripe data lives in the generic `resources` table; query JSON fields with json_extract.

### Top 10 customers with at-risk PM

```bash
stripe-pp-cli subs-at-risk --within 30d --limit 10 --json --select customer_email,mrr,card_exp
```

Email these customers proactively before involuntary churn hits.

### Replay missed events since last cron tick

```bash
stripe-pp-cli events-since --type 'invoice' --json --select id,type,created,data.object.id
```

Cursor-driven event tail — one-shot, agent-friendly, persists cursor between runs.

### Reconcile this week's payouts

```bash
stripe-pp-cli payout-reconcile --since 7d --csv
```

Joins payout → balance_transactions → charges → customers; flags missing rows.

### Compact customer dossier for agent context

```bash
stripe-pp-cli customer-360 alice@example.com --json --select customer.email,active_subscriptions,open_disputes,lifetime_spend
```

Use --select to project deeply-nested fields; saves tokens vs full dossier.

## Auth Setup

Authenticate by exporting `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...` (recommended) or running `stripe-pp-cli auth set-token <key>` to persist it. Test-mode keys (`sk_test_...`) and live-mode keys (`sk_live_...`) are accepted; this v1 does NOT yet enforce a live-mode write guard, so audit any live invocation before running mutating commands.

Run `stripe-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  stripe-pp-cli account --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
stripe-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
stripe-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
stripe-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.stripe-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `STRIPE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `STRIPE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
stripe-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
stripe-pp-cli --profile briefing account
stripe-pp-cli profile list --json
stripe-pp-cli profile show briefing
stripe-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `stripe-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/stripe/cmd/stripe-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add stripe-pp-mcp -- stripe-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which stripe-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   stripe-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `stripe-pp-cli <command> --help`.
