# PokéAPI — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `pokeapi-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pokeapi --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `pokeapi-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/pokeapi/cmd/pokeapi-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when you want a fully-local, fully-queryable Pokédex. It is ideal for agents answering Pokémon questions without spending live API calls, for battle-planning workflows that combine type math and learnset filtering, and for any reverse-search question (find the move, the ability, the form, the requirement) that the live REST surface doesn't natively answer. Skip it for purely image-driven workflows where another tool already handles sprite rendering.

## When Not to Use This CLI

Do not activate this CLI for requests that require creating, updating, deleting, publishing, commenting, upvoting, inviting, ordering, sending messages, booking, purchasing, or changing remote state. This printed CLI exposes read-only commands for inspection, export, sync, and analysis.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local store that compounds
- **`pokemon by-ability`** — Find every Pokémon with a given ability. Live API has no reverse index — this is a single SQL query against the local store.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs to enumerate Pokémon by trait without making thousands of API calls._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon by-ability levitate --json --select name,types
  ```
- **`move find`** — Find moves by status effect, damage class, type, or target — e.g. all moves that paralyze a Steel-type.

  _Use this for battle planning questions framed by effect rather than by move name._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli move find --effect paralyze --type-target steel --json
  ```
- **`team suggest`** — Given an in-progress team, score every remaining Pokémon by how well it covers the team's typing gaps. Returns top candidates.

  _Best for team-building agents that need objective gap-coverage scoring rather than vibes-based recommendations._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli team suggest pikachu,charizard --slots 6 --json --select name,types,score
  ```
- **`pokemon diff-learnset`** — Compare the move learnsets of two Pokémon (often regional forms or megas) and surface what each can learn that the other cannot.

  _Useful when an agent needs to argue 'why pick form X over form Y' with concrete move evidence._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon diff-learnset charizard charizard-mega-x --json
  ```
- **`pokemon history`** — Show how a Pokémon has changed over generations: type changes, stat changes, ability changes, and which generation it was introduced in.

  _Reach for this when answering historical Pokémon questions ('was Clefairy always a Fairy type?')._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon history clefairy --json
  ```
- **`pokemon forms`** — List every form for a species (e.g. Vulpix vs Alolan Vulpix) with type, stat, and ability deltas inline.

  _Use when an agent needs a species-wide answer rather than a single-form payload._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon forms vulpix --json
  ```
- **`evolve into`** — Given a target Pokémon, surface the species you would need to evolve and the conditions (item, level, friendship, time of day) to get there.

  _Pick this when the user knows the Pokémon they want and needs the path to it, not the inverse._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli evolve into umbreon --json
  ```
- **`team gaps`** — List which of the 18 types your in-progress team has neither defensive resistance nor offensive super-effectiveness against.

  _Use when answering 'what would a hostile team most likely exploit on this lineup?'_

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli team gaps pikachu,charizard,blastoise --json
  ```
- **`encounters by-region`** — Render a region-level encounter table joining locations, areas, encounters, and species — every Pokémon you can find in (e.g.) Kanto.

  _When the question is regional ('what catches in Kanto?') rather than per-Pokémon._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli encounters by-region kanto --version red --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`search`** — Full-text search across Pokémon, moves, abilities, items, and locations — names plus flavor text — with relevance ranking.

  _Agent fallback when names are partial or fuzzy; replaces multiple list calls + grep._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli search "flame" --type move --limit 10 --json
  ```
- **`sql`** — Read-only SQL access to the local store. Power users and agents can compose joins the CLI doesn't expose directly.

  _Reach for this when a one-off question doesn't have a dedicated subcommand._

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli sql "SELECT id FROM resources WHERE resource_type='pokemon' ORDER BY id LIMIT 10" --json
  ```

### Battle math
- **`damage`** — Compute expected damage range for a move from one Pokémon to another, factoring in STAB, type effectiveness, level, and base stats.

  _Reach for this on every battle-planning question framed as 'will it KO?' or 'how hard does X hit Y?'_

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli damage charizard blastoise hydro-pump --level1 50 --level2 50 --json
  ```
- **`pokemon top`** — Rank Pokémon by a base stat (attack, special-attack, speed, hp, etc.), optionally filtered by type. Returns the top N.

  _Use when learning the meta or filling a role on a team where the question is 'who's the best X-type at Y?'_

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon top --by special-attack --type ghost --limit 10 --json
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
pokeapi-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### What does my team leave exposed?

```bash
pokeapi-pp-cli team gaps pikachu,charizard,blastoise --json
```

Returns every type your team has neither resistance nor super-effective answer for. One local join.

### Reverse-search by effect

```bash
pokeapi-pp-cli move find --effect paralyze --type-target steel --json --select name,type,power,accuracy
```

Find paralyzing moves that hit Steel — using --select to keep the response narrow for agent context.

### Trim a profile to just what an agent needs

```bash
pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon profile pikachu --json --select name,types,stats.hp,stats.attack,abilities
```

Use --select with dotted paths to pluck only high-gravity fields out of a deeply nested response — keeps the agent's context light.

### Compare two regional forms

```bash
pokeapi-pp-cli pokemon diff-learnset vulpix vulpix-alola --json
```

Side-by-side learnset diff between Vulpix and Alolan Vulpix. One local query instead of two full API fetches.

### Custom join via SQL

```bash
pokeapi-pp-cli sql "SELECT id FROM resources WHERE resource_type='pokemon-species' ORDER BY id LIMIT 10" --json
```

Drop down to raw SQL when there's no first-class command — read-only, direct local-store access.

## Auth Setup

No authentication required.

Run `pokeapi-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  pokeapi-pp-cli ability list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Read-only** — do not use this CLI for create, update, delete, publish, comment, upvote, invite, order, send, or other mutating requests

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
pokeapi-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
pokeapi-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
pokeapi-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.pokeapi-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `POKEAPI_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `POKEAPI_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
pokeapi-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
pokeapi-pp-cli --profile briefing ability list
pokeapi-pp-cli profile list --json
pokeapi-pp-cli profile show briefing
pokeapi-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `pokeapi-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)
## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/pokeapi/cmd/pokeapi-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add pokeapi-pp-mcp -- pokeapi-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which pokeapi-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
