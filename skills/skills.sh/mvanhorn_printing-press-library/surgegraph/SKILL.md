# SurgeGraph — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `surgegraph-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install surgegraph --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `surgegraph-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/ai/surgegraph/cmd/surgegraph-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when an agent needs to operate against SurgeGraph for any AI-search content task: monitoring AI Visibility deltas, drafting and publishing articles in bulk, auditing knowledge-library impact, or seeding another agent with a project's current state. Every visible web-app feature is also a CLI command, and every transcendence command is an MCP tool — the agent that opened the loop can close it without leaving the terminal.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds

- **`visibility delta`** — See exactly what moved in AI Visibility week over week — overview, trend, sentiment, or traffic — without screenshotting two dashboard tabs and diffing them by hand.

  _Use this when the user asks what changed in AI Visibility or wants a movers report; it answers without burning a follow-up API roundtrip._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli visibility delta --project proj_abc123 --window 168h --metric overview,trend --agent
  ```
- **`visibility prompts losers`** — Surface tracked prompts whose citation count or first-position rank dropped vs the prior window — the report a CMO asks for every Monday and the dashboard can't produce.

  _Pick this when the user is hunting for visibility regressions; gives the agent a ranked, actionable list instead of two raw snapshots to compare._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli visibility prompts losers --project proj_abc123 --since 720h --agent --select prompt_id,prompt,citation_delta,position_delta
  ```
- **`visibility citation-domains rank-shift`** — Watch which domains gained or lost citation share for your project's AI-tracked prompts over a 30-day window — useful when a competitor starts crowding the answer set.

  _Use when monitoring competitive share-of-voice in AI answers._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli visibility citation-domains rank-shift --project proj_abc123 --window 720h --agent
  ```
- **`docs stale`** — List writer and optimized docs not updated in the last N days, ranked by recent AI-source traffic — the refresh queue in one query.

  _Use when prioritizing a content refresh queue._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli docs stale --project proj_abc123 --older-than 90 --agent --select document_id,title,last_updated,ai_traffic_30d
  ```
- **`visibility portfolio`** — Roll up AI Visibility deltas across every project in the organization — the agency-portfolio view the single-project UI doesn't produce.

  _Use when the user manages multiple projects (agency, multi-brand) and asks for an executive summary._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli visibility portfolio --window 168h --agent
  ```
- **`account burn`** — Project credit exhaustion from your last 30 days of usage snapshots — a pre-flight check before queueing a large bulk-publish run.

  _Pick this before kicking off a bulk operation to confirm you have credits._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli account burn --window 720h --agent
  ```

### Cross-entity joins no single API call returns

- **`knowledge impact`** — Rank a project's knowledge libraries by how often their grounded URLs actually appear in tracked AI citations — answers "is this library worth maintaining?".

  _Pick this when the user audits knowledge libraries or asks which library is paying off._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli knowledge impact --project proj_abc123 --agent
  ```
- **`research drift`** — Diff a topic_research's hierarchical map against the writer_documents you've already shipped — covered vs gap, ranked for action.

  _Use when planning a content sprint from a topic research; tells the agent exactly which subtopics still need articles._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli research drift --research-id res_xyz789 --project proj_abc123 --agent --select topic,parent,covered
  ```
- **`research domain diff`** — Set-diff a competitor's domain_research topic tree against your own topic_research — instant view of what they cover and you don't.

  _Pick this when comparing topical coverage against a named competitor._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli research domain diff --project proj_abc123 --mine res_xyz789 --theirs dom_res_aaa --agent
  ```
- **`visibility traffic-citations`** — For each top-traffic page, list the tracked prompts whose AI citations resolved to it — answers "why is this page getting AI traffic?".

  _Use when explaining traffic patterns or planning new content based on what's already pulling AI clicks._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli visibility traffic-citations --project proj_abc123 --agent --select page_url,ai_visits,citations
  ```

### Compound workflows that span products

- **`research gaps publish`** — Take topic-gap output, bulk-create documents in 50-doc batches, and queue them into a WordPress integration — one idempotent command for the content-ops ritual.

  _Pick this when the user wants to ship articles for every gap from a topic research; collapses a multi-tab manual workflow into one call._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli research gaps publish --research-id res_xyz789 --project proj_abc123 --integration wp_int_456 --dry-run --agent
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing

- **`context bundle`** — Emit a JSON blob shaped for an agent's context window covering prompts, citations, docs, and topic-maps for one project — the handoff payload an agent's loop needs.

  _Use to seed another agent's working memory with everything you know about a SurgeGraph project, in one round-trip._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli context bundle --project proj_abc123 --include prompts,citations,docs,topics
  ```
- **`search`** — Full-text search across local cache: AI Visibility prompts, citations, writer documents, optimized documents, and topic-map nodes — one query, multi-entity hits.

  _Pick this when an agent needs to locate any signal — a prompt, a citation, a draft — across the whole local cache._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli search "AI search optimization" --kind prompts,citations,docs,topics --agent --select kind,id,title,snippet
  ```
- **`sync diff`** — Emit per-resource sync cursors and total row counts from the local store — the inspection primitive for agent loops that need to know whether a re-sync is due.

  _Run after `sync` to inspect cursor freshness, or in an agent loop to decide whether the local store needs to be re-synced before reading._

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli sync diff --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
surgegraph-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Monday AI Visibility review

```bash
surgegraph-pp-cli visibility delta --project proj_abc123 --window 168h --agent --select brand,metric,delta_pct
```

Pull week-over-week movers and pipe straight into the Monday CMO update.

### Trim a deeply-nested citations response

```bash
surgegraph-pp-cli get-ai-visibility-citations --project-id proj_abc123 --agent --select data.domains.domain,data.domains.citationCount
```

Citation responses are deeply nested; dotted-path `--select` keeps the payload under an agent's context budget.

### Find every signal about a topic across the local cache

```bash
surgegraph-pp-cli search "AI search optimization" --kind prompt,citation,doc,topic --agent --select kind,id,title,snippet
```

FTS5 across all four entities in one round-trip; results are unified and rankable. Run `sync` first to populate the index.

### Publish every gap topic to WordPress

```bash
surgegraph-pp-cli research gaps publish --research-id res_xyz789 --project proj_abc123 --integration wp_int_456 --dry-run
```

Compounds get_topic_map → create_bulk_documents → publish_document_to_cms; idempotent on retries.

### Filter results to one citation kind from the local cache

```bash
surgegraph-pp-cli search "answer engine" --kind citation --agent
```

Limit FTS hits to one entity kind via `--kind`; combine with `--limit` to keep output bounded.

## Auth Setup

SurgeGraph uses OAuth 2.1 against https://mcp.surgegraph.io with Authorization Code + PKCE + Dynamic Client Registration. Run `surgegraph-pp-cli auth login` once; the CLI registers a client, walks you through the browser flow, and stores the bearer plus refresh token for subsequent calls. `auth status` shows the current TTL and `auth logout` clears it.

Run `surgegraph-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  surgegraph-pp-cli create-ai-visibility-prompt --intent example-value --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
surgegraph-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
surgegraph-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
surgegraph-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.surgegraph-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `SURGEGRAPH_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `SURGEGRAPH_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
surgegraph-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
surgegraph-pp-cli --profile briefing create-ai-visibility-prompt --intent example-value
surgegraph-pp-cli profile list --json
surgegraph-pp-cli profile show briefing
surgegraph-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `surgegraph-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release, then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add surgegraph-pp-mcp -- surgegraph-pp-mcp
```

Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which surgegraph-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   surgegraph-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `surgegraph-pp-cli <command> --help`.
