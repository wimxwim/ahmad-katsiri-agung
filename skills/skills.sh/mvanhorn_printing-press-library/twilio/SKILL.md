# Twilio — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `twilio-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install twilio --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `twilio-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/twilio/cmd/twilio-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when an agent or operator needs Twilio data they cannot get in one API call: cross-subaccount aggregation, delivery-failure analysis, TCPA opt-out audits, idle-number cleanup, or any 'how was last week' question. It is also the right tool for incident triage when a CallSid needs the full Call+Recording+Transcription stitch in one command. Skip it for one-off message sends if you already have twilio-cli configured — but for any analytic or investigative workflow it is faster, offline-capable, and agent-native.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`delivery-failures`** — See why messages failed last week, grouped by error code and destination country, with the dollar cost of those failures totaled.

  _When debugging delivery, agents need the failure distribution, not 4000 individual rows. This command answers 'why is delivery degraded' in one query._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli delivery-failures --since 7d --json
  ```
- **`subaccount-spend`** — One CSV with every subaccount's last-month spend pivoted across SMS, MMS, voice, and recording categories — the agency-billing report nobody else ships.

  _For agency operators, this is the entire monthly billing report in one command. Agents can run it with --period thisMonth for a live forecast._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli subaccount-spend --period last-month --csv > march-billing.csv
  ```
- **`message-status-funnel`** — Distribution of message terminal statuses (delivered, failed, undelivered, sent) with delivery-rate percentages and median time-to-delivery.

  _Operations dashboards need the funnel, not the raw rows. One query is the whole 'is delivery healthy right now' answer._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli message-status-funnel --since 24h --json
  ```
- **`call-disposition`** — Cross-tab of call Status (completed, busy, no-answer, failed, canceled) by AnsweredBy (human, machine_start, fax), with dollar cost per bucket.

  _Outbound campaign tuning depends on knowing the human-pickup rate vs voicemail rate. Agents can answer this without paging through thousands of call records._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli call-disposition --since 7d --json
  ```

### Cross-entity stitches
- **`call-trace`** — Given a CallSid, return everything that happened on that call: metadata, recordings, transcriptions, conference participation — in one structured output.

  _On-call engineers paged about a dropped call need the full picture in seconds, not three API round trips while the customer waits._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli call-trace CAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --json
  ```
- **`idle-numbers`** — Phone numbers you are paying for but have not used to send or receive in N days — with the dollar amount you are wasting per month.

  _At $1/number/month, agencies running 100+ subaccount numbers can save hundreds annually. Agents can run it as a monthly cleanup task._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli idle-numbers --since 30d --json
  ```
- **`webhook-audit`** — Group your IncomingPhoneNumbers by their Voice/SMS webhook URL to find single-use URLs that may be orphans pointing at deleted endpoints. Add --probe for a live HEAD check.

  _Orphan webhooks silently fail incoming calls and SMS. Quarterly audit is cheap insurance against silent dropped traffic._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli webhook-audit --probe --json
  ```
- **`conversation`** — All messages and calls involving one phone number, merged into a single timestamped timeline with in/out arrows, body, and duration.

  _When investigating a customer complaint or fraud claim, the full back-and-forth is one query. Agents can answer 'what did we say to this number' without four searches._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli conversation +14155551234 --json
  ```

### Compliance & audit
- **`opt-out-violations`** — Find numbers that texted STOP/UNSUBSCRIBE/END/QUIT and any messages your account sent to them afterwards — the TCPA exposure check the Twilio API has no resource for.

  _TCPA fines are $500–$1,500 per violation. Compliance teams audit for this quarterly; agents can spot-check it any time._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli opt-out-violations --since 90d --json --select to,opt_out_at,subsequent_send_at,message_sid
  ```
- **`error-code-explain`** — Top error codes from your recent messages and calls, with curated one-line explanations and fixes for the most common Twilio errors.

  _Every Twilio user Googles error codes. Bundling the explanation with the count removes a constant context-switch._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli error-code-explain --since 7d --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`sync-status`** — Last sync timestamp and row count per resource in the local store — so you know how fresh every other analytic command is.

  _Without freshness UX every analytic command is suspect. One read tells the agent whether to call sync first._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli sync-status --json
  ```
- **`tail-messages`** — Stream new messages with a status filter as they happen — twilio-pp-cli's --follow that twilio-cli does not ship.

  _Incident triage and on-call response need a live feed of failures, not a polling shell loop. One command, no daemon._

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli tail-messages --status failed --follow
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
twilio-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Weekly delivery-failure report

```bash
twilio-pp-cli delivery-failures --since 7d --json --select error_code,to_country,count,cost_total
```

Runs the failure aggregation against the local store, narrows the response to the four fields that matter so an agent can summarise without parsing 4000 raw rows.

### Last-month agency billing CSV

```bash
twilio-pp-cli subaccount-spend --period last-month --csv > march-billing.csv
```

Walks every subaccount, calls usage/records per subaccount, pivots categories to columns, writes one wide CSV the finance team can paste straight into a spreadsheet.

### On-call call-trace from a Slack page

```bash
twilio-pp-cli call-trace CAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --json --select call.status,call.duration,recordings,transcriptions.text
```

Single command for the full Call → Recording → Transcription chain. Use --select with dotted paths to keep the response small enough that an agent can summarise it in a Slack reply.

### Quarterly TCPA opt-out audit

```bash
twilio-pp-cli opt-out-violations --since 90d --csv > q1-opt-out-audit.csv
```

Local temporal join finds inbound STOP/UNSUBSCRIBE messages and any subsequent outbound messages to the same number — the report compliance teams pay legal teams to construct manually today.

### Find idle numbers wasting money

```bash
twilio-pp-cli idle-numbers --since 30d --json --select phone_number,friendly_name,monthly_cost,last_activity
```

LEFT JOIN over IncomingPhoneNumbers / Messages / Calls flagging numbers with no activity in 30 days. Output is one row per number with the dollar amount being wasted per month.

## Auth Setup

Twilio uses HTTP Basic auth. You can authenticate with your Account SID (AC...) plus your Auth Token, OR with a scoped API Key SID (SK...) plus its Secret. The Account SID is always required because it is part of the URL path. Run `twilio-pp-cli doctor` to verify your credentials, detect whether the key is master or scoped, and warn on parent/subaccount mismatches.

Run `twilio-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  twilio-pp-cli 2010-04-01 create-account --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
twilio-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
twilio-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
twilio-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.twilio-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `TWILIO_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `TWILIO_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
twilio-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
twilio-pp-cli --profile briefing 2010-04-01 create-account
twilio-pp-cli profile list --json
twilio-pp-cli profile show briefing
twilio-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `twilio-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/twilio/cmd/twilio-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add twilio-pp-mcp -- twilio-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which twilio-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   twilio-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `twilio-pp-cli <command> --help`.
