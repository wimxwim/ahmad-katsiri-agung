# archive.today — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `archive-is-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install archive-is --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `archive-is-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/archive-is/cmd/archive-is-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this whenever a user wants to archive a URL, read a paywalled article, check whether something was previously archived, or batch-capture a list of URLs for research. Specifically good when:

- A user sends a paywalled link and asks "can you read this" → `read` fetches text via archive
- They want to preserve a URL that might change → `save` forces a fresh capture
- They want historical versions → `history` lists all known snapshots
- They have 20+ URLs to archive → `bulk` runs rate-limited batch archival

Don't reach for this if the URL is trivially scrapeable without archive services (no paywall, robots-allowed, direct HTTP works), or if the user wants the original source rather than a cached version.

## Unique Capabilities

The whole CLI is unique — archive.today has no official API. But within this CLI, certain commands are the differentiators.

### The hero commands

- **`read <url>`** — Find or create an archive for a URL. Looks up existing snapshots first (Memento timegate → CDX fallback); submits a fresh capture only if nothing exists. The "always do the right thing" command.

  _This is how 90% of agent calls should start. It's idempotent — calling it twice on the same URL doesn't double-submit._

- **`get <url> [--format text|html]` / `tldr <url>`** — Fetch article text, optionally LLM-summarized. Automatic Wayback fallback when archive.today serves a CAPTCHA (which happens daily to cloud IPs).

  _`tldr` pipes the fetched text through a summarization step — useful for agent chains where you want a short take without shipping 20KB of HTML back._

### Durability operations

- **`save <url>`** — Force a fresh capture via `/submit/?url=<x>&anyway=1`. Use when `read` returns an existing snapshot that's too old or missing a paywall update.

- **`history <url>`** — List all known snapshots via Memento timemap parsing. Shows every capture date across both archive.today and Wayback.

- **`bulk [file]`** — Rate-limited batch archiving from a file or stdin. Reads URLs one per line, submits each with backoff, returns a report of successes / failures / pre-existing.

  _`grep -oE 'https?://[^ )]+' notes.md | archive-is-pp-cli bulk -` archives every URL in a markdown file._

- **`request <url>`** — Fire-and-forget submit with optional wait+poll. Useful for long captures where you want to come back later.

### Observability

- **`snapshots newest <url>`** — Just the newest snapshot URL for a target, useful in scripts.

- **`captures`** — List your local capture index (post-sync).

- **`feeds`** — archive.today's global recent-archives feed.

- **`--backend archive-is,wayback`** — Every read/get accepts a backend preference. Defaults to archive-is with Wayback fallback; flip the order for Wayback-primary.

## Command Reference

Archive + retrieve:

- `archive-is-pp-cli read <url>` — Find or create (hero command)
- `archive-is-pp-cli get <url>` — Fetch article text (with Wayback fallback)
- `archive-is-pp-cli tldr <url>` — Fetch + summarize
- `archive-is-pp-cli save <url>` — Force fresh capture
- `archive-is-pp-cli request <url>` — Fire-and-forget submit
- `archive-is-pp-cli check <url>` — Does an archive exist?

Listing + history:

- `archive-is-pp-cli history <url>` — All known snapshots
- `archive-is-pp-cli newest <url>` — Newest snapshot URL
- `archive-is-pp-cli captures` — Local capture index
- `archive-is-pp-cli feeds` — Global recent feed

Batch:

- `archive-is-pp-cli bulk [file]` — Batch from file or stdin

Local store:

- `archive-is-pp-cli sync` / `archive` / `export` / `import` — Local SQLite ops

Auth + health:

- `archive-is-pp-cli auth` — Config (no API key needed; auth is a no-op)
- `archive-is-pp-cli doctor` — Verify backend reachability

## Recipes

### Read a paywalled article

```bash
archive-is-pp-cli read "https://www.wsj.com/articles/..." --agent
# or: return just the text
archive-is-pp-cli get "https://www.wsj.com/articles/..." --format text --agent
```

`read` returns the archive URL (finding existing or creating new). `get --format text` returns the article body, falling back to Wayback if archive.today CAPTCHAs.

### Preserve a URL before it changes

```bash
archive-is-pp-cli save "https://example.com/important-page" --agent
archive-is-pp-cli history "https://example.com/important-page" --agent  # verify
```

Force capture, then check history to confirm the new snapshot registered.

### Bulk archive a research batch

```bash
grep -oE 'https?://[^ )]+' research-notes.md | archive-is-pp-cli bulk - --agent
# or from a file:
archive-is-pp-cli bulk urls.txt --agent
```

Reads URLs one per line, submits each with exponential backoff, returns per-URL status (archived, pre-existing, failed) as JSON.

### Wayback-preferred for a reliable-read

```bash
archive-is-pp-cli read "https://ft.com/content/xyz" --backend wayback,archive-is --agent
```

Use when the Wayback Machine snapshot is known to be cleaner or archive.today is rate-limiting.

## Auth Setup

**No API key required.** Archive.today and Wayback Machine are both public. The `auth` subcommand exists for consistency but is a no-op — `doctor` reports "Auth: not required" which is the expected state.

Optional env:
- `ARCHIVE_IS_BASE_URL` — override archive.today host (for mirrors)
- `WAYBACK_BASE_URL` — override Wayback Machine host

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes --no-prompt`. Every action command also prints structured `next_actions` hints on stderr when called non-interactively — the calling agent sees "tried X, got Y, consider Z" automatically.

Notable flags:
- `--submit-timeout <duration>` — max wait for a fresh submit (default `10m`; `0` = unbounded)
- `--backend archive-is,wayback` — backend preference and fallback order
- `--format text|html` — `get`/`tldr` output format

### Filtering output

`--select` accepts dotted paths to descend into nested responses; arrays traverse element-wise:

```bash
archive-is-pp-cli <command> --agent --select id,name
archive-is-pp-cli <command> --agent --select items.id,items.owner.name
```

Use this to narrow huge payloads to the fields you actually need — critical for deeply nested API responses.


### Response envelope

Data-layer commands wrap output in `{"meta": {...}, "results": <data>}`. Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's `live` or local. The `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a TTY; piped/agent consumers see pure JSON on stdout.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error |
| 3 | Not found (no snapshot exists) |
| 5 | API error (archive.today or Wayback down) |
| 7 | Rate limited (too many submits) |

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/archive-is/cmd/archive-is-pp-cli@latest
archive-is-pp-cli doctor
```

### MCP Server

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/archive-is/cmd/archive-is-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add archive-is-pp-mcp -- archive-is-pp-mcp
```

## Argument Parsing

Given `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → run `archive-is-pp-cli --help`
2. **`install`** → CLI; **`install mcp`** → MCP
3. **Anything that looks like a URL, or "archive <url>" / "bypass paywall on <url>"** → `read <url> --agent` is the default — it's idempotent and covers the 90% case.
4. **"bulk archive" / "archive these"** → `bulk` from stdin if URLs are pasted, else ask for the file path.

## Agent Workflow Features

This CLI exposes three shared agent-workflow capabilities patched in from cli-printing-press PR #218.

### Named profiles

Persist a set of flags under a name and reuse them across invocations.

```bash
# Save the current non-default flags as a named profile
archive-is-pp-cli profile save <name>

# Use a profile — overlays its values onto any flag you don't set explicitly
archive-is-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>

# List / inspect / remove
archive-is-pp-cli profile list
archive-is-pp-cli profile show <name>
archive-is-pp-cli profile delete <name> --yes
```

Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.

### --deliver

Route command output to a sink other than stdout. Useful when an agent needs to hand a result to a file, a webhook, or another process without plumbing.

```bash
archive-is-pp-cli <command> --deliver file:/path/to/out.json
archive-is-pp-cli <command> --deliver webhook:https://hooks.example/in
```

File sinks write atomically (tmp + rename). Webhook sinks POST `application/json` (or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact` is set). Unknown schemes produce a structured refusal listing the supported set.

### feedback

Record in-band feedback about this CLI from the agent side of the loop. Local-only by default; safe to call without configuration.

```bash
archive-is-pp-cli feedback "what surprised you or tripped you up"
archive-is-pp-cli feedback list         # show local entries
archive-is-pp-cli feedback clear --yes  # wipe
```

Entries append to `~/.archive-is-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl` as JSON lines. When `ARCHIVE_IS_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `ARCHIVE_IS_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream (non-blocking — local write always succeeds).
