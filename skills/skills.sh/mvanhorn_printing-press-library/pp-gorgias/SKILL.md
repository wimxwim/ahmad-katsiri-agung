# Gorgias — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `gorgias-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install gorgias --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `gorgias-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/sales-and-crm/gorgias/cmd/gorgias-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for gorgias-pp-cli whenever a support workflow needs to read or write Gorgias data: pulling recent tickets for digest, searching past conversations for context, automating bulk tag/macro applications, monitoring oncall queues, or building agent-driven escalation flows. The sibling MCP server lets LLMs drive the same surface without shelling out.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.
- **`gorgias-pp-cli doctor --json`** — Probes /account with the configured credentials and reports `credentials: valid` only when an authenticated call succeeds.

  _Saves the first-five-minutes credential-debug cycle when wiring up an agent._

  ```bash
  gorgias-pp-cli doctor --json
  ```
- **`gorgias-pp-cli sync --resources tickets --since 7d && gorgias-pp-cli search 'refund' --agent`** — Syncs API data to a local SQLite DB so subsequent searches, analytics, and joins run without hitting the API.

  _Makes repeated agent-driven lookups (e.g. searching for similar past tickets) practical at scale. Ticket `--since` uses documented `order_by=updated_datetime:desc` plus local filtering; do not add undocumented filters like `updated_datetime__gte` unless Gorgias documents them and a live smoke confirms them._

  ```bash
  gorgias-pp-cli sync --resources tickets --since 30d --json
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
gorgias-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Sync recent tickets to a local SQLite mirror

```bash
gorgias-pp-cli sync --resources tickets --since 7d
```

Hydrates the local DB so subsequent searches and analytics run offline against a recent snapshot instead of hitting the API on every call.

For tickets, `--since` is implemented as documented newest-first ordering plus a local cutoff. A live test on May 23, 2026 showed `updated_datetime__gte` returns HTTP 400 `Unknown field`, so agents should not try to "repair" ticket sync with that parameter.

### Full-text search across synced tickets

```bash
gorgias-pp-cli search 'refund cancellation' --limit 10 --agent
```

Searches the local SQLite mirror for tickets matching the query — much faster than the live API for repeated lookups.

### Stream live ticket changes

```bash
gorgias-pp-cli tail --interval 30s --agent
```

Polls the API on the given interval and emits one JSON line per new or updated ticket — useful for triage agents that should react to changes.

### Find tickets with no assignee

```bash
gorgias-pp-cli orphans --agent
```

Lists items missing key fields like assignee or project — the standard 'unowned work' query for support leads.

### Find stale tickets

```bash
gorgias-pp-cli stale --days 7 --agent
```

Lists items with no updates in the last 7 days. Pairs well with `orphans` for an oncall review.

### Run a compound workflow

```bash
gorgias-pp-cli workflow --agent
```

Lists available compound workflows that combine multiple API operations into one bounded payload.

## Auth Setup

Gorgias uses HTTP Basic auth — your account email as username and an API key from Settings → Account → REST API as password. Set `GORGIAS_USERNAME`, `GORGIAS_API_KEY`, and `GORGIAS_BASE_URL` (https://<tenant>.gorgias.com/api). How those env vars get into the process is up to you — a shell profile, a secrets manager, a CI secret store; the CLI doesn't care.

Run `gorgias-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  gorgias-pp-cli account get --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

### Error envelope

Under `--json` (or `--agent`), failures emit a single JSON document on stderr:

```json
{"error": {"message": "<human-readable cause>", "exit_code": <int>}}
```

Exit codes match the table in [Exit Codes](#exit-codes) below. Commands that
naturally carry status in their own JSON body (e.g. `doctor --json`) embed
the failure inside the report instead, and stderr is empty — `jq` always sees
a single JSON document per stream.

### Configuration discovery

In addition to `GORGIAS_USERNAME`, `GORGIAS_API_KEY`, and `GORGIAS_BASE_URL`, the
CLI honors `GORGIAS_CONFIG` (path to a TOML config file, default
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gorgias-pp-cli/config.toml`) and the standard XDG variables
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`. On Windows, the CLI falls
back to `os.UserConfigDir()` / `os.UserCacheDir()` (`%APPDATA%`,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%`) when the XDG vars are unset.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
gorgias-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
gorgias-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
gorgias-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.gorgias-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `GORGIAS_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `GORGIAS_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration

```
gorgias-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
gorgias-pp-cli --profile briefing account get
gorgias-pp-cli profile list --json
gorgias-pp-cli profile show briefing
gorgias-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `gorgias-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release, then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add gorgias-pp-mcp -- gorgias-pp-mcp
```

Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which gorgias-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   gorgias-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `gorgias-pp-cli <command> --help`.
