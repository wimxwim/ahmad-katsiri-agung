# Azure DevOps — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `azure-devops-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install azure-devops --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `azure-devops-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer). This installs into `$GOPATH/bin` (default `$HOME/go/bin`), so add that directory to `$PATH` instead:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/azure-devops/cmd/azure-devops-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

azure-devops-pp-cli syncs your work items, builds, and PRs to a local SQLite mirror and lets you query them with SQL or structured --agent output. It matches everything `az devops` and the Microsoft MCP server can do, then adds fifteen cross-entity analytics commands that require no live API calls — sprint velocity, PR review queues, scope creep detection, cycle time analysis, and more.

## When to Use This CLI

Use azure-devops-pp-cli when an agent needs to read or write Azure DevOps data: work items, pull requests, pipelines, builds, or sprint state. It is the fastest path to structured JSON output for ADO data without a browser or the Python-based az devops extension. Use it especially for cross-entity analytics (velocity, cycle time, scope creep) that require the local SQLite mirror. Prefer `az devops` only when you need features this CLI does not yet cover (migrations, live entitlement management).

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Do not use this CLI for Azure resource management (VMs, storage, AKS) — use the `az` CLI instead.
- Do not use this CLI for GitHub repositories — use the `gh` CLI.
- Do not use this CLI for reading raw file content from Azure Blob Storage.
- Do not use this CLI for Azure Boards queries that require real-time board state not yet synced.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`standup`** — See your PRs awaiting review, in-progress work items, and newly failed builds in one command — ready before the standup meeting.

  _Use this when an agent needs a quick briefing on a developer's current work state before creating tasks or PRs on their behalf._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli standup --agent
  ```
- **`velocity`** — See sprint-over-sprint velocity with trend line for the current team — points completed vs committed, across the last N sprints.

  _Use this when an agent needs to assess team capacity or forecast delivery dates based on historical throughput._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli velocity --sprints 6 --agent
  ```
- **`work sprint-creep`** — See which work items were added to the current sprint after it started, with total story points of scope added mid-sprint.

  _Use this when an agent needs to identify whether a sprint is at risk due to scope expansion after commit._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli work sprint-creep --team ENG --json
  ```
- **`work rollover`** — Find work items that have been moved to a new sprint more than once — the chronic blockers that keep slipping through sprint planning.

  _Use this when an agent needs to identify persistent delivery risks before sprint planning._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli work rollover --min-rollovers 2 --agent
  ```
- **`pipeline flaky`** — Identify build stages with the highest intermittent failure rate over the last N runs — the stages that fail and then pass without code changes.

  _Use this when an agent needs to identify which pipeline stages are unreliable test signals before acting on build failures._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli pipeline flaky --definition-id 42 --last 30 --agent
  ```
- **`wit cycle-time`** — Measure average time from Active to Done per work item type over a date range — the team's true delivery throughput.

  _Use this when an agent needs to estimate realistic delivery timelines based on historical cycle time._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli wit cycle-time --type Bug --weeks 12 --agent
  ```
- **`git branch-health`** — See a health dashboard for every repo in the project: default branch build status, last commit age, and open PR count — in one table.

  _Use this when an agent needs to assess overall code health across a multi-repo project before planning changes._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli git branch-health --agent --select repo,buildStatus,lastCommitDays,openPRs
  ```
- **`work area-load`** — See open work item counts and total story points grouped by area path — to spot overloaded teams or abandoned backlogs.

  _Use this when an agent needs to identify which teams have the most outstanding work before assigning new items._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli work area-load --state Active --agent
  ```
- **`pr aging`** — Find pull requests with no reviewer activity for N or more days, grouped by author — to surface forgotten PRs before they go stale.

  _Use this when an agent needs to identify PRs that are at risk of losing context due to review delays._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli pr aging --days 3 --agent
  ```
- **`branches stale`** — List branches that are safe to delete: already merged into default, no open PRs, and no commits in the last N days.

  _Use this when an agent is helping clean up a repository's branch proliferation._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli branches stale --repo myapp --days 30 --agent
  ```
- **`builds cost`** — See agent minutes consumed per pipeline per week over the last N weeks — to find pipelines that are growing in CI cost.

  _Use this when an agent needs to identify which pipelines are contributing to growing CI/CD costs._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli builds cost --weeks 8 --agent
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`pr review-queue`** — See only the PRs where you are a required reviewer, the build is passing, and no other required reviewer has voted yet — ordered by readiness.

  _Use this when an agent needs to identify which PRs a developer should review first to unblock teammates._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli pr review-queue --agent --select title,buildStatus,waitingReviewers
  ```
- **`release gate-queue`** — See all release gates and YAML pipeline stages currently waiting for your approval across every pipeline, with how long each has been waiting.

  _Use this when an agent needs to identify which deployments are blocked on human approval and how urgent each is._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli release gate-queue --agent --select pipelineName,stageName,waitMinutes
  ```
- **`work diff`** — Show exactly which fields changed between two revisions of a work item — a git-style diff for specification and acceptance criteria.

  _Use this when an agent needs to understand what changed in a work item's requirements between two points in time._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli work diff --id 4812 --from 3 --to 7 --agent
  ```
- **`git commit-builds`** — Given a commit SHA, see every build and pipeline run that included that commit and whether it passed or failed.

  _Use this when an agent needs to determine whether a specific code change has been validated by CI._

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli git commit-builds --sha a1b2c3d4 --repo myapp --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
azure-devops-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Morning standup in one command

```bash
azure-devops-pp-cli standup --agent --select myPRs,myWorkItems,failedBuilds
```

Returns your daily briefing as structured JSON: PRs waiting for your review, work items in progress, and builds that failed since yesterday.

### Find PRs ready for your review

```bash
azure-devops-pp-cli pr review-queue --agent --select title,repo,buildStatus,waitingReviewers
```

Shows only PRs where you are required, the build is green, and no other required reviewer has voted — ordered by most ready first.

### Sprint velocity trend for capacity planning

```bash
azure-devops-pp-cli velocity --sprints 8 --team ENG --agent --select sprint,committed,completed,velocityPoints
```

Returns 8-sprint velocity history as structured JSON for an agent to compute averages and forecast next sprint capacity.

### Scope creep check at sprint mid-point

```bash
azure-devops-pp-cli work sprint-creep --team ENG --agent --select addedItems,addedPoints,percentCreep
```

Shows what was added to the current sprint after it started, with story points and percentage of total sprint scope that crept in.

### Cross-repo health before a release

```bash
azure-devops-pp-cli git branch-health --agent --select repo,buildStatus,lastCommitDays,openPRs
```

One-line summary of all repos: default branch build status, days since last commit, and open PR count — to confirm everything is green before a release.

## Auth Setup

Set AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN to a Personal Access Token. Generate one at dev.azure.com/{org}/_usersSettings/tokens with scopes: Work Items (read/write), Code (read), Build (read), Release (read/execute). Run `azure-devops-pp-cli auth setup --launch` to open the token page. Save with `azure-devops-pp-cli auth set-token <your-pat>`.

Run `azure-devops-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  azure-devops-pp-cli apis avatar-remove-project-avatar mock-value mock-value --api-version example-value --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set — piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
azure-devops-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
azure-devops-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
azure-devops-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/azure-devops-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `AZURE_DEVOPS_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `AZURE_DEVOPS_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
azure-devops-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
azure-devops-pp-cli --profile briefing apis avatar-remove-project-avatar mock-value mock-value --api-version example-value
azure-devops-pp-cli profile list --json
azure-devops-pp-cli profile show briefing
azure-devops-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Async Jobs

For endpoints that submit long-running work, the generator detects the submit-then-poll pattern (a `job_id`/`task_id`/`operation_id` field in the response plus a sibling status endpoint) and wires up three extra flags on the submitting command:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--wait` | Block until the job reaches a terminal status instead of returning the job ID immediately |
| `--wait-timeout` | Maximum wait duration (default 10m, 0 means no timeout) |
| `--wait-interval` | Initial poll interval (default 2s; grows with exponential backoff up to 30s) |

Use async submission without `--wait` when you want to fire-and-forget; use `--wait` when you want one command to return the finished artifact.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `azure-devops-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/azure-devops/cmd/azure-devops-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add azure-devops-pp-mcp -- azure-devops-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which azure-devops-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   azure-devops-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `azure-devops-pp-cli <command> --help`.
