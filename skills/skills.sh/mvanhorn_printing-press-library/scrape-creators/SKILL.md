# Scrape Creators — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `scrape-creators-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `scrape-creators-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer). This installs into `$GOPATH/bin` (default `$HOME/go/bin`), so add that directory to `$PATH` instead:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/scrape-creators/cmd/scrape-creators-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Scrape Creators exposes 164 read-only endpoints across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, Spotify, and 21 more platforms behind one API key. This CLI mirrors all of them as typed commands and MCP tools, then adds the layer the official CLI lacks: a local SQLite store with FTS5 so paid transcripts, profiles, and ad creatives become a queryable, diffable corpus. Cross-platform commands like 'creator find', 'trends triangulate', and 'ads monitor' answer questions no single endpoint can.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent or analyst needs on-demand public social-media data across many platforms and wants to accumulate it locally for repeat querying. It is the right choice for competitive ad monitoring, influencer discovery and vetting, transcript-corpus building for RAG, and cross-platform trend and follower tracking — anything where a local, diffable copy of paid data beats stateless per-call fetches.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Do not use this CLI to post, comment, message, or modify anything on any platform — every endpoint is read-only public-data extraction.
- Do not use it as a free data source — every request costs a Scrape Creators credit; for one-off ad-hoc reads the hosted MCP or a single curl may be cheaper than a full sync.
- Do not use it to access private or login-gated content; it only returns public data the API exposes.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-platform compounding

- **`creator find`** — Given one handle, see which of 12 creator platforms the creator is on with follower counts side-by-side.

  _Reach for this before writing creator outreach — one call replaces 11+ manual per-platform lookups._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator find mrbeast --agent
  ```
- **`creator compare`** — Compare two or more creators side-by-side on follower count, engagement rate, and content volume.

  _Use it to separate real reach from vanity follower counts when vetting a shortlist._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator compare mkbhd mrwhosetheboss --agent --select handle,engagement_rate,follower_count
  ```
- **`trends triangulate`** — Snapshot a hashtag or topic across platforms in one call to see which platform it is biggest on.

  _Use it to catch a trend's leading platform before it crests, for content-timing calls._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli trends triangulate "stanley cup" --agent
  ```

### Local engagement analytics

- **`content spikes`** — Surface the videos that performed far above a creator's own baseline — the ones that actually went viral.

  _Pick this over a raw post list when you want a creator's outlier hits, not their average output._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli content spikes mrbeast --agent
  ```

### Local store that compounds

- **`transcripts search`** — FTS5 full-text search across every transcript you've synced — YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Rumble.

  _Reach for this for brand-safety and topic sweeps over a corpus you already paid to fetch — no credits re-spent._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli transcripts search "affiliate link" --agent --select creator,platform,snippet
  ```
- **`creator track`** — Append a follower snapshot per run on a chosen platform, then read the growth trajectory over time.

  _Run it on a schedule to chart partner-creator growth; meaningful once multiple snapshots accumulate._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator track mrbeast --agent
  ```
- **`ads monitor`** — Snapshot a brand's live ads across Facebook, TikTok, Google, and LinkedIn ad libraries; on rerun, diff new ads vs. ones that disappeared.

  _Use it for recurring competitive ad tracking — the first run is a unified search, every rerun is a what-changed diff._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli ads monitor nike --agent
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing

- **`account budget`** — See how fast you're spending API credits and how many days remain at the current pace, computed from the API's credit balance and daily usage history.

  _Credits are pay-as-you-go and depletion returns HTTP 402 mid-workflow — check runway before a big sync._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli account budget --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Vet an influencer shortlist

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli creator compare mkbhd mrwhosetheboss unboxtherapy --agent --select handle,platform,follower_count,engagement_rate
```

Compare candidates on engagement rate, not just follower count, to separate real reach from vanity metrics.

### Monitor a competitors ads weekly

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli ads monitor nike --agent
```

First run snapshots Nikes current creatives across Facebook, TikTok, Google, and LinkedIn; rerun weekly to diff new vs. pulled ads.

### Search a cached transcript corpus

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli transcripts search "sponsored by" --agent --select creator,platform,snippet
```

Transcripts are cached to the local store whenever you run the per-platform transcript commands; this searches them offline with no credits re-spent.

### Catch a rising trends leading platform

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli trends triangulate "labubu" --agent
```

See per-platform result velocity for a topic and which platform it is cresting on first.

### Check credit runway before a big pull

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli account budget --agent
```

Project days-remaining at your current burn rate so a batch of calls does not hit HTTP 402 halfway through.

## Auth Setup

Authentication is a single Scrape Creators API key sent in the x-api-key header. Set SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY in your environment, or run 'auth login' to store it. Credits are pay-as-you-go and never expire; a depleted balance returns HTTP 402, so check 'account budget' before a large sync.

Run `scrape-creators-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli account list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Read-only** — do not use this CLI for create, update, delete, publish, comment, upvote, invite, order, send, or other mutating requests

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set — piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Paths and state

Agents should treat the CLI's path resolver as part of the runtime contract:

- Use `--home <dir>` for one invocation, or set `SCRAPE_CREATORS_HOME=<dir>` to relocate all four path kinds under one root.
- Use per-kind env vars only when a specific kind must diverge: `SCRAPE_CREATORS_CONFIG_DIR`, `SCRAPE_CREATORS_DATA_DIR`, `SCRAPE_CREATORS_STATE_DIR`, `SCRAPE_CREATORS_CACHE_DIR`.
- Resolution order is per-kind env var, `--home`, `SCRAPE_CREATORS_HOME`, XDG (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`), then platform defaults.
- `config` contains settings like `config.toml` and profiles. `data` contains `credentials.toml`, `data.db`, cookies, and auth sidecars. `state` contains persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log`. `cache` contains regenerable HTTP/cache files.
- Stored secrets live in `credentials.toml` under the data dir. Existing legacy `config.toml` secrets are read for compatibility and leave `config.toml` on the first auth write.
- Run `scrape-creators-pp-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to surface path and credential-location warnings. `agent-context` exposes a schema v4 `paths` block for agents that need the resolved dirs.
- For MCP, pass relocation through the MCP host config. The MCP binary does not inherit CLI flags:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "scrape-creators": {
        "command": "scrape-creators-pp-mcp",
        "env": {
          "SCRAPE_CREATORS_HOME": "/srv/scrape-creators"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Fleet precedence: an inherited per-kind env var overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `SCRAPE_CREATORS_HOME` or per-kind vars as durable fleet levers, and use `--home` only for a single invocation. Relocation is not reversible by unsetting env vars; move files manually before clearing `SCRAPE_CREATORS_HOME`, or `doctor` will not find credentials left under the former root.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
scrape-creators-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
scrape-creators-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
scrape-creators-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally as `feedback.jsonl` under the resolved data dir. They are never POSTed unless `SCRAPE_CREATORS_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `SCRAPE_CREATORS_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
scrape-creators-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
scrape-creators-pp-cli --profile briefing account list
scrape-creators-pp-cli profile list --json
scrape-creators-pp-cli profile show briefing
scrape-creators-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `scrape-creators-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/scrape-creators/cmd/scrape-creators-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add scrape-creators-pp-mcp -- scrape-creators-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which scrape-creators-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   scrape-creators-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `scrape-creators-pp-cli <command> --help`.
