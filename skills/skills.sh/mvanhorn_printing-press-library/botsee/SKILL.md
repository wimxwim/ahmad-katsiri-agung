# BotSee — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `botsee-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install botsee --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `botsee-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/marketing/botsee/cmd/botsee-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when an agent or pipeline needs structured BotSee data without burning credits on repeat reads. Best for: running a fresh AI-visibility audit (`ai-visibility-audit <url>` is the headline), inspecting an existing site's setup (`site-config`), generating recommendations from a completed analysis, or aggregating cited sources across multiple sites for a portfolio view. Not the right tool for hosted dashboard UI use — that's `app.botsee.io`.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Flagship workflow
- **`ai-visibility-audit`** — One command runs the full BotSee audit: idempotent on existing sites, bootstraps customer types and personas and questions if missing, then runs analysis across every LLM and prints a structured visibility report.

  _This is THE command. Reach for it when an agent or user says 'audit my AI visibility' or 'check how AI sees example.com' — it handles the full lifecycle._

  ```bash
  botsee-pp-cli ai-visibility-audit example.com --types 2 --personas 2 --questions 5 --watch --agent
  ```
- **`recommendations`** — Generate next-step recommendations from an analysis — promoted to top-level so agents can discover it without descending into the analysis subcommand tree.

  _Use after an analysis to get LLM-generated action items without re-spending if you already pulled them once._

  ```bash
  botsee-pp-cli recommendations $ANALYSIS_UUID --agent
  ```

### Workflow plumbing
- **`site-config`** — Print the full customer-types -> personas -> questions tree for a site, with UUIDs and the actual edit commands users can copy-paste to add, update, or remove any node.

  _Reach for this when a user asks 'what is set up for this site' or 'show me my BotSee config' — it surfaces every UUID needed for follow-up edits._

  ```bash
  botsee-pp-cli site-config --site $SITE_UUID --agent
  ```
- **`sites-summary`** — Aggregate cited sources across every synced site, grouped by domain, with citation count, distinct sites citing each domain, and first-seen timestamp.

  _Use for multi-site users and agencies who need the cross-portfolio answer 'which sources keep getting cited everywhere' — impossible without local aggregation._

  ```bash
  botsee-pp-cli sites-summary --agent --select domain,citation_count,distinct_sites_citing,first_seen
  ```

## Command Reference

**account** — Manage account

- `botsee-pp-cli account` — Returns account details including company name, site count, and owner information.

**analysis** — Manage analysis

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
botsee-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Audit a new domain end-to-end

```bash
botsee-pp-cli ai-visibility-audit example.com --watch --output report.md
```

Creates the site, generates structure, runs analysis, writes a markdown report. Re-running on the same domain just runs a fresh analysis (no duplicate site).

### Preview the cost before running

```bash
botsee-pp-cli ai-visibility-audit example.com --estimate-only --agent
```

Returns predicted credit + USD cost without spending — reads the live `/pricing` endpoint for current multipliers.

### Inspect what's configured for a site

```bash
botsee-pp-cli site-config --site $SITE_UUID --agent --select customer_types,personas,questions
```

Returns the nested tree as JSON — agents can walk it to find UUIDs for follow-up `personas update / questions delete` calls.

### Find sources getting cited across every brand

```bash
botsee-pp-cli sites-summary --agent --select domain,citation_count,distinct_sites_citing
```

Cross-site domain authority rollup — impossible via the BotSee API which is per-site only.

### Search every LLM response for a competitor mention

```bash
botsee-pp-cli search "competitor name" --type responses --limit 20 --agent --select analysis_uuid,model,response_text
```

FTS5 over every raw LLM response synced locally — narrows the deeply-nested response payload to just the fields agents need.

## Auth Setup

BotSee uses Bearer tokens prefixed `bts_live_`. Set `BOTSEE_API_KEY` in your environment and the CLI threads it into every authenticated call. Manage keys with `api-keys list / create / rotate / reset / delete` — `reset` consumes a one-time token emailed to the account holder if the key was lost. The CLI never logs key values.

Run `botsee-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  botsee-pp-cli account --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set — piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
botsee-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
botsee-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
botsee-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.botsee-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `BOTSEE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `BOTSEE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
botsee-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
botsee-pp-cli --profile briefing account
botsee-pp-cli profile list --json
botsee-pp-cli profile show briefing
botsee-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `botsee-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release, then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add botsee-pp-mcp -- botsee-pp-mcp
```

Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which botsee-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   botsee-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `botsee-pp-cli <command> --help`.
