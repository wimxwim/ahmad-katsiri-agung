# Dub — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `dub-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install dub --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `dub-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/marketing/dub/cmd/dub-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Use dub-pp-cli when an agent or operator needs to manage Dub at workspace scale — bulk link operations, campaign-wide UTM rewrites, partner program audits, bounty triage, or local cross-resource analysis. The CLI's local SQLite store makes joins across links, analytics, partners, commissions, and bounties cheap and offline. Reach for dub-pp-cli over the official `dub-cli` when you need anything beyond link shortening or workspace config.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`links stale`** — Find archived, expired, or zero-traffic links across the workspace before they pile up.

  _Use this to clean up dormant short links before a portfolio review or before bulk-archiving. The /analytics endpoint can't filter links by 'no clicks in N days' in a single call._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links stale --days 90 --json --select id,key,clicks,archived
  ```
- **`links drift`** — Detect links whose click rate dropped more than threshold percent week-over-week.

  _Catches dying campaigns before reporting deadlines. Use this in a weekly automation to surface attribution links that quietly stopped converting._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links drift --window 7d --threshold 30 --json
  ```
- **`links duplicates`** — Find every link in the workspace pointing to the same destination URL.

  _Surfaces accidental duplicates from bulk-create overruns and consolidation candidates after a migration._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links duplicates --json
  ```
- **`links lint`** — Audit short-key slugs for lookalike collisions, reserved-word violations, and brand-conflict hazards.

  _Use this before a brand campaign launch to catch lookalike slugs that confuse partners or get reserved-word treatment._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links lint --json
  ```
- **`links rollup`** — Performance dashboard aggregated by tag or folder — clicks, leads, sales rolled up across every link wearing each label.

  _Use this to compare campaign performance across tag dimensions without reconciling 5 separate API calls._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links rollup --by clicks --group-by tag --json
  ```
- **`funnel`** — Click-to-lead-to-sale conversion rates per link or campaign.

  _Surfaces where prospects drop off in your attribution funnel. Use before quarterly reporting to spot links with high clicks and low conversion._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli funnel --link mylink --min-clicks 50 --json
  ```
- **`customers journey`** — See every link a customer clicked, when they became a lead, and when they purchased — in one timeline.

  _Use this for QBR-style account reviews or to debug attribution issues for a specific customer._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli customers journey cust_abc123 --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`links rewrite`** — Show every link that would change and the exact patch BEFORE sending.

  _Use this before any campaign-wide rewrite. Diff preview prevents the worst class of bulk-mutation mistakes._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli links rewrite --match 'utm_source=oldcampaign' --replace 'utm_source=newcampaign' --dry-run
  ```
- **`health`** — Cross-resource Monday-morning report: rate-limit headroom, expired-but-active links, dead destination URLs, unverified domains, dormant tags, bounty submissions awaiting review.

  _Use this as the first thing every morning, or as a CI canary. Surfaces what needs attention without dashboard hopping._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli health --json
  ```
- **`since`** — What happened in the last N hours? Created, updated, deleted links plus partner approvals, new bounty submissions, and top-clicked entities.

  _Use this in agent loops to summarize workspace activity since the last check-in. Cheap and idempotent._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli since 24h --json
  ```

### Partner ops
- **`partners leaderboard`** — Rank partners by commission earned, conversion rate, and clicks generated.

  _Use this to identify top performers before a partner-tier review, or dormant partners worth deactivating._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli partners leaderboard --by commission --top 10 --json
  ```
- **`partners audit-commissions`** — Reconcile partners, commissions, bounties, and payouts to flag stale rates, missing payouts, and expired bounties still earning.

  _Run this before a payout cycle to catch billing surprises. Use in CI before any commission-rate migration._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli partners audit-commissions --json
  ```
- **`bounties triage`** — Group partner-submitted bounty proof by status, age, and bounty type. Surfaces backlog awaiting review.

  _Run weekly to keep bounty submissions from rotting. Bounty programs lose partner trust when submissions sit unreviewed._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli bounties triage --status pending --older-than 7d --json
  ```
- **`bounties payout-projection`** — Project upcoming payouts from approved-but-unpaid submissions multiplied by current commission rates.

  _Use this for finance/marketing planning. Surfaces upcoming payout liability before the next payout cycle._

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli bounties payout-projection --window 30d --json
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
dub-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Find dormant links worth archiving

```bash
dub-pp-cli sync && dub-pp-cli links stale --days 60 --json --select key,url,clicks,createdAt
```

Sync first, then ask for links with zero clicks in the last 60 days. Pipe through `jq` to filter further or build an archive batch.

### Preview a campaign-wide UTM swap before sending

```bash
dub-pp-cli links rewrite --match 'utm_source=launch' --replace 'utm_source=summer' --dry-run --json
```

The diff preview shows every link that would change. Drop `--dry-run` only after reading the patch.

### Triage bounty submissions waiting more than 7 days

```bash
dub-pp-cli bounties triage --status pending --older-than 7d --json --select id,partnerId,bountyType,submittedAt
```

Surfaces the partner submissions rotting in the queue. Pipe through `jq` to group by `partnerId` for outreach lists.

### Per-partner ROI for the top 10 partners

```bash
dub-pp-cli partners leaderboard --by commission --top 10 --agent --select 'partnerId,partnerName,clicks,leads,sales,commission'
```

Combines /partners/analytics with local commissions and payouts. Use `--select` with dotted paths to keep the response small for agents — leaderboards return wide rows by default.

### Sync, then run the full Monday-morning health check

```bash
dub-pp-cli sync && dub-pp-cli health --json
```

Combined report across rate-limit headroom, expired-but-active links, dead destination URLs, unverified domains, and bounty submissions awaiting review.

## Auth Setup

dub-pp-cli reads DUB_API_KEY from the environment (Speakeasy convention; DUB_TOKEN also accepted for compatibility with prior community CLIs). The key is workspace-scoped — the workspace is implicit in the key. Get one from dub.co/settings/tokens and run `dub-pp-cli doctor` to verify connectivity.

Run `dub-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  dub-pp-cli commissions list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
dub-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
dub-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
dub-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.dub-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `DUB_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `DUB_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
dub-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
dub-pp-cli --profile briefing commissions list
dub-pp-cli profile list --json
dub-pp-cli profile show briefing
dub-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `dub-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)
## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/dub/cmd/dub-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add dub-pp-mcp -- dub-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which dub-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   dub-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `dub-pp-cli <command> --help`.
