# Eventbrite — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `eventbrite-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install eventbrite --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `eventbrite-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/eventbrite/cmd/eventbrite-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent manages an organizer's Eventbrite presence: creating and publishing events, pulling order and attendee history, and answering cross-event questions (which events sell slowest, which fans return, who the top buyers are, how a discount code performed) that the per-event dashboard and existing single-org MCP servers cannot answer. It is the right tool whenever the task needs the whole order/attendee history in one place rather than a single live API lookup. When the same promoter also sells on DICE, both CLIs emit JSON and a local SQLite store, so an agent can join the two datasets by event (name and date) and by buyer email for a cross-platform performance and loyalty picture.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-event sales analytics
- **`sales-velocity`** — Ranks all your live events by tickets sold per day since on-sale and projects a sell-out date.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs to know which of an organizer's events are underperforming right now, not just current totals._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli sales-velocity --json
  ```
- **`discount-performance`** — Per discount code: redemptions, type, and the redemption rate (share of the code's allotment used).

  _Pick this to measure whether a promo code actually drove sales before renewing or killing it._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli discount-performance --json
  ```
- **`capacity`** — Sold vs total capacity and percent remaining across all your live events at once.

  _Use this to spot which events are near sell-out or badly under-sold in a single call._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli capacity --json
  ```
- **`refund-rate`** — Refunded and cancelled order counts, refunded revenue, and the rate per event or across the org.

  _Pick this to flag events with abnormal refund rates that signal a pricing, date, or fulfillment problem._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli refund-rate --json
  ```
- **`top-buyers`** — Ranks ticket buyers by total spend across all your events, not just by how many events they attended.

  _Reach for this to find an organizer's highest-value customers for VIP or pre-sale outreach._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli top-buyers --limit 25 --json
  ```

### Search your own data offline
- **`repeat-attendees`** — Finds fans who bought into two or more of your events, across your whole synced history.

  _Use this for loyalty and re-marketing questions an agent cannot answer from any one event's attendee list._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli repeat-attendees --min 2 --json
  ```
- **`roster`** — Offline attendee roster for one event with checked-in vs not-yet, VIP and comp flags, door-sorted.

  _Reach for this at the door when an agent needs a fast who-has-not-checked-in list without a live API round-trip._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli roster 1234567890 --csv
  ```
- **`fan-export`** — Exports unique attendee contacts (email, name, events attended, check-in status), deduped across all your events and filterable by event.

  _Use this to build a clean, deduped contact list for an email campaign across an organizer's whole audience._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli fan-export --csv
  ```

### Agency multi-org view
- **`org-rollup`** — Single pane across every organization your token can see: events count, tickets sold, gross, and top event per org.

  _Use this for an agency or multi-brand operator who needs one client roll-up instead of logging into each org._

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli org-rollup --json
  ```

## Command Reference

**balance** — Manage balance


**categories** — <a name="categories_object"></a>

## Category Object

An overarching category that an event falls into (vertical). Examples are “Music”, and “Endurance”.

- `eventbrite-pp-cli categories category-by-id` — Gets a `category` by ID as ``category``.
- `eventbrite-pp-cli categories list-of` — Returns a list of Category as categories, including subcategories nested. Returns a paginated response.

**discounts** — <a name="discount_object"></a>

## Discount Object

The Discount object represents a discount that an Order owner can use when purchasing tickets to an [Event](#event_object).

A Discount can be used to a single [Ticket Class](#ticket_class_object) or across multiple Ticket Classes for multiple Events simultaneously (known as a cross event Discount).

There are four types of Discounts:

+ **Public Discount.** Publically displays Discount to Order owner on the Event Listing and Checkout pages. Only used with a single Event.

+ **Coded Discount.** Requires Order owner to use a secret code to access the Discount.

+ **Access Code.** Requires Order owner to use a secret code to access hidden tickets. Access codes can also optionally contain a discount amount.

+ **Hold Discount.** Allows Order owner to apply or unlock Discount for seats on hold.

The display price of a ticket is calculated as: \
`price_before_discount` - `discount_amount` = `display_price`

Notes:

* Public and Coded Discounts can specify either an amount off or a percentage off, but not both types discounts.

* Public Discounts should not contain apostrophes or non-alphanumeric characters (except “-���, “_”, ” ”, “(”, ”)”, “/”, and “”).

* Coded Discounts and Access Codes should not contain spaces, apostrophes or non-alphanumeric characters (except “-”, “_”, “(”, ”)”, “/”, and “”).

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Find your slowest-selling live events

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli sales-velocity --json
```

Ranks every live event by tickets sold per day since on-sale with a projected sell-out date, computed from the local order store.

### Surface returning fans for re-marketing

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli repeat-attendees --min 3 --agent --select email,name,events_count
```

Cross-event attendee join; --agent emits structured rows and --select narrows to just the contact fields an email tool needs.

### Door check-in roster, offline

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli roster 1234567890 --csv
```

Prints the synced attendee roster for one event with checked-in status as CSV for a will-call sheet — no live API call required.

### Agency Friday client roll-up

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli org-rollup --json
```

One pane across every organization the token can see: events, tickets sold, gross, and top event per client org.

### Measure a promo code's ROI

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli discount-performance --json
```

Ranks discount codes by redemptions and redemption rate (share of each code's allotment used) from the synced discount objects.

### Combine Eventbrite + DICE for full event performance

```bash
eventbrite-pp-cli fan-export --json
```

Export your Eventbrite buyer/attendee list as JSON; a promoter selling the same show on DICE exports the DICE side too, then an agent joins events by name and date and buyers by normalized email for a cross-platform performance and loyalty view no single platform shows.

## Auth Setup

Eventbrite uses an OAuth2 private token sent as a Bearer header. For your own account you do not need the full OAuth dance — copy a private token from eventbrite.com/platform/api-keys and set EVENTBRITE_API_KEY. Run `eventbrite-pp-cli doctor` to confirm it is picked up.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  eventbrite-pp-cli formats list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set — piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
eventbrite-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
eventbrite-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
eventbrite-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.eventbrite-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `EVENTBRITE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `EVENTBRITE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
eventbrite-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
eventbrite-pp-cli --profile briefing formats list
eventbrite-pp-cli profile list --json
eventbrite-pp-cli profile show briefing
eventbrite-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `eventbrite-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/eventbrite/cmd/eventbrite-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add eventbrite-pp-mcp -- eventbrite-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which eventbrite-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   eventbrite-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `eventbrite-pp-cli <command> --help`.
