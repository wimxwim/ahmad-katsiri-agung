# Flight Goat — Printing Press CLI

## What this skill is for

Use Flight Goat when the user is making a flight decision, not merely looking up an aviation API endpoint.

Default to the free fare and route-discovery commands first:

- `flights` — Google Flights fare search for a specific itinerary.
- `dates` — cheapest-date scan across a travel window.
- `explore` — nonstop destinations from an airport using Kayak route data.
- `longhaul` and `cheapest-longhaul` — long-haul route discovery and cheap-date scans.
- `compare` — fares plus route reliability when operational risk matters.
- `assess` — delayed-flight/rebooking assessment using airport, route, weather, and optional price context.

FlightAware AeroAPI is secondary and optional. Use AeroAPI-backed commands when the user needs live status, airport delays, disruption counts, aircraft/tail history, alerts, route reliability, or Foresight predictions. Do not present the whole CLI as credential-gated: Google Flights and Kayak-backed commands work without `FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH`.

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `flight-goat-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install flight-goat --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `flight-goat-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/travel/flight-goat/cmd/flight-goat-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## Data sources and credential posture

| Job | Primary commands | Credential |
|---|---|---|
| Find fares for known dates | `flights`, `gf-search` | None |
| Find cheaper travel dates | `dates`, `cheapest-longhaul` | None |
| Discover nonstop or long-haul destinations | `explore`, `longhaul` | None |
| Weigh price against reliability | `compare`, `reliability`, `assess` | AeroAPI improves reliability/status evidence |
| Monitor or investigate live operations | `monitor`, `ontime-now`, `digest`, `heatmap`, `aircraft-bio`, `eta`, `resolve` | Usually needs AeroAPI |
| Manage FlightAware alerting/history/airport/operator APIs | `alerts`, `history`, `airports`, `operators`, `schedules`, `foresight` | AeroAPI required |

If the user asks a normal travel-planning question, start with Google Flights/Kayak commands. Reach for AeroAPI only when operational evidence changes the decision.

## Google Flights Currency

Use `--currency <ISO-4217-code>` when the user wants Google Flights prices in a
specific currency. Omit it for the default USD behavior.

```bash
flight-goat-pp-cli flights MAN AGP 2026-05-10 --currency GBP --sort cheapest --agent
flight-goat-pp-cli dates JFK CDG --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-31 --currency EUR --sort --agent
flight-goat-pp-cli compare SEA LHR 2026-06-15 --currency GBP --agent
```

The flag is only valid on Google Flights price commands: `flights`, `dates`,
`compare`, `gf-search`, and `cheapest-longhaul`. Do not add it to AeroAPI or
Kayak-only commands.

## Delay Assessment

Use `assess` first when the user asks whether a delay is systemic, whether to
switch flights, or which same-route alternative is operationally safer.

```bash
flight-goat-pp-cli assess --origin SFO --destination DCA --delayed-flight UA123 --agent
flight-goat-pp-cli assess --origin KSFO --destination KJFK --depart-after 18:00 --no-prices --agent
```

`assess` joins AeroAPI airport delays, disruption counts, weather, route
alternatives, delayed-flight status, inbound-aircraft status, FAA NAS Status,
and optional Google Flights prices. Read `decision.verdict`,
`decision.systemic_signals`, `decision.flight_signals`, `alternatives`, and
`sources` before recommending an action. Failed upstream calls remain visible in
`sources` and `decision.missing_evidence`; do not treat a partial report as a
complete all-clear. Use `--include-raw` only when the original AeroAPI JSON is
needed for audit or custom scoring. FAA NOTAM data is not part of this command
yet.

## AeroAPI endpoint families

AeroAPI still matters when the task is operational rather than fare-shopping. The generated command reference below exposes FlightAware endpoint families for current and historical flights, Foresight predictions, airports, operators, alerts, schedules, and disruption counts. Treat those as the operational layer behind the higher-level decision commands, not as the CLI's core value proposition.

## Command Reference

**transcendence** — Compound flight decisions

- `flight-goat-pp-cli assess` — Classifies systemic vs flight-specific delay risk and ranks alternatives with AeroAPI, FAA NAS Status, inbound aircraft, and optional Google Flights price context.

**aircraft** — Manage aircraft

- `flight-goat-pp-cli airports get-nearby` — Returns a list of airports located within a given distance from the given location.

**alerts** — AeroAPI alerting can be used to configure and receive real-time alerts on key flight
events. With customizable alerting offered by our alert endpoints, AeroAPI empowers
users to selectively pick various types of events/filters to alert on. By doing so,
you can receive specially tailored alerts delivered to you for events such as flight plan
filed, flight departure (out and off), flight arrival (on and in), and more!

To get started with alerting, the **PUT /alerts/endpoint** endpoint must first be used
to set up the account-wide default URL that alerts will be delivered to. This step must
be done before any alerts can be configured and will serve as the fallback URL that all
alerts will be sent to for the account if a specific delivery URL is not designated on a
particular alert. If this is not performed before configuring alerts, then you will
receive a 400 error with an error message reminding you of this step when trying to interact
with the **POST /alerts** endpoint. Once a URL is set via the **PUT /alerts/endpoint** endpoint,
then alerts can be configured using the **POST /alerts** endpoint. The **GET /alerts** endpoint
can also be used to retrieve all currently configured alerts associated with your AeroAPI key.
The **GET /alerts** endpoint will allow you to easily retrieve the id of any specific alerts of
interest configured for the account which can let you use the **GET** **PUT** and **DELETE**
**/alerts/{id}** endpoints to retrieve, update, and delete specific alerts.

When configuring an individual alert, the *target_url* field can be set to a URL that’s
different than the account-wide target endpoint set via the **PUT /alerts/endpoint**. If
the *target_url* field is set on an alert, then that specific alert will be delivered to
the specified *target_url* rather than the default account-wide one. If this field is not
configured for the alert, then the alert will be delivered to the default account-wide endpoint.
By setting this field, one can easily target different alerts to be received by different endpoints
which can be useful for configuring per-application alerts or sending alerts to an alternate
development environment without having to adjust a production alert configuration.

For each alert configured, one-to-many ‘events’ can be set for alert delivery. While most
events will result in one alert delivery, both the *arrival* and the *departure* events can
result in multiple alerts delivered (referred to as bundled). The *departure* event bundles the
departure (actual OFF the ground) alert, along with the flight plan filed alert and up to 5
per-departure changes which can include alerts for significant departure delays of over
30 minutes, gate changes, and airport delays. FlightAware Global customers will
also receive *Power on* and *Ready to taxi* alerts as part of the departure bundle. The *arrival* event
bundles the arrival (actual ON the ground) alert, along with up to 5 en-route changes (including delays
of over 30 minutes and excluding diversions) identified. FlightAware Global customers will also receive
*taxi stop* times as part of the *arrival* bundle. Setting a bundled type and unbundled type for an
On/Off will only result in a single alert in the case where events may overlap.

If there is a need to change the alert configurations, updating an alert using the **PUT /alerts/{id}**
endpoint and a unique alert identifier (id) is preferred rather than creating an additional alert.
By doing so, you can avoid duplicate alerts being delivered which could create unnecessary noise
if they are not of interest anymore.

If at any point there is a need to delete an alert, the **DELETE alerts/{id}** endpoint can be
leveraged to delete an alert so that it won’t be delivered anymore. As a reminder, specific alert
IDs can be retrieved from the **GET /alerts** endpoint.

- `flight-goat-pp-cli flights get-count-by-search` — Full search query documentation is available at the /flights/search endpoint.

**foresight** — Foresight endpoints provide access to FlightAware's Foresight predictive models and
predictions for key events. Our advanced machine learning (ML) models identify key
influencing factors for a flight to forecast future events in real-time, providing
unprecedented insight to improve operational efficiencies and facilitate better
decision-making in the air and on the ground. To learn more about the power of Foresight,
visit https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/foresight/

These endpoints each mirror a non-Foresight equivalent endpoint of similar functionality,
with the addition of all the ML 'predicted' values included in the Foresight response. The
respective non-Foresight endpoint response includes a flag, 'foresight_predictions_available',
which can optionally be used as a trigger to obtain and leverage Foresight predictions on an
as-needed basis and manage cost. Foresight is only available to Premium tier customers.
Contact integrationsales@flightaware.com for more information, pricing details, and to have
your account enabled for Foresight.

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
flight-goat-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Auth Setup

Do **not** require AeroAPI auth for normal fare discovery. `flights`, `dates`, `explore`, `longhaul`, `gf-search`, and `cheapest-longhaul` can run without `FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH`.

Set the optional AeroAPI key only when the user needs FlightAware-backed status, reliability, alerts, history, aircraft/tail, disruption, or Foresight commands:

```bash
export FLIGHT_GOAT_API_KEY_AUTH="<your-key>"
```

Or persist it in `~/.config/flight-goat-pp-cli/config.toml`.

Run `flight-goat-pp-cli doctor` to verify which upstreams are configured.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  flight-goat-pp-cli airports get KSEA --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

### Flight booking URLs

Each result from `flights` carries `booking_urls` for one-tap booking handoff:

```json
{
  "booking_urls": {
    "primary": "https://www.delta.com/flightsearch/book-a-flight?...",
    "primary_kind": "prefill",
    "airline_url": "https://www.delta.com/flightsearch/book-a-flight?...",
    "airline_kind": "prefill",
    "google_url": "https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=..."
  }
}
```

- `primary` is the recommended single URL. Click once, land on a booking surface.
- `primary_kind` tells you what to call it:
  - `prefill` — airline form pre-filled with route + dates. Render as "Book on <airline>".
  - `landing` — airline booking page; user may need to retype dates. Render as "Open <airline> booking".
  - `search` — Google Flights search executed with the user's query. Render as "View on Google Flights".
- `airline_url` and `airline_kind` are present only when the itinerary is operated end-to-end by a single carrier in the curated table (~35 carriers, see `internal/gflights/testdata/airline_url_captures.md`). Codeshare itineraries and unknown carriers omit these.
- `google_url` is always populated.

If you only render one URL, render `primary` and use `primary_kind` to pick the call-to-action text.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
flight-goat-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
flight-goat-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
flight-goat-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.flight-goat-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `FLIGHT_GOAT_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `FLIGHT_GOAT_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
flight-goat-pp-cli profile save agent-json --json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes
flight-goat-pp-cli --profile agent-json dates SEA LHR --from 2026-06-01 --to 2026-08-31 --sort
flight-goat-pp-cli profile list --json
flight-goat-pp-cli profile show agent-json
flight-goat-pp-cli profile delete agent-json --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `flight-goat-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)
## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/travel/flight-goat/cmd/flight-goat-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add flight-goat-pp-mcp -- flight-goat-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which flight-goat-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   flight-goat-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `flight-goat-pp-cli <command> --help`.
