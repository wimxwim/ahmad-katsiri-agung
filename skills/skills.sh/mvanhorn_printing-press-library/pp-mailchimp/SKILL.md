# Mailchimp — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `mailchimp-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install mailchimp --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `mailchimp-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/marketing/mailchimp/cmd/mailchimp-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when you need to drive Mailchimp from a terminal or agent and the workflow spans more than one endpoint: subscribing a contact with tags, importing a CSV through the batch endpoint, measuring whether a campaign worked, or auditing segment hygiene. The local SQLite cache makes the audience SQL-queryable, which is impossible through the dashboard or the SDK. The MCP surface uses code orchestration over 291 endpoints in ~1K tokens, so an agent can reach any Mailchimp endpoint without bloating its tool list.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Workflow composition
- **`subscribe`** — Upsert a member by email and apply tags in a single command. Auto-computes the MD5 subscriber hash so you never see it.

  _When an agent needs to add a contact with tags, this is one call instead of three with MD5 hashing in the middle._

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli subscribe alice@example.com --list a1b2c3d4e5 --tags vip,onboarding --merge FNAME=Alice
  ```
- **`bulk-subscribe`** — Read a CSV, fan out through Mailchimp's /batches endpoint (the official 10-concurrent-connection escape hatch), poll until done, decode the tar.gz of JSONL results within the 10-minute response URL window, and print per-row outcomes.

  _When an agent needs to subscribe more than ~50 contacts at once, this is the only safe path that respects rate limits and gives back actionable per-row results._

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli bulk-subscribe --csv contacts.csv --list a1b2c3d4e5 --tags newsletter --watch
  ```

### Local joins that compound
- **`digest`** — Single-campaign mode (digest <id>) joins report + email-activity + ecommerce-product-activity into one summary with opens/clicks/bounces/revenue + top-clicked links + top-converted products. Rollup mode (digest --last N or --week) renders a multi-campaign summary table with aggregate stats. --md renders either as paste-ready markdown.

  _Use digest <id> for per-campaign analysis; use digest --last N for a weekly rollup. --md is the paste-into-doc shape both personas need._

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli digest --last 5 --md
  ```
- **`segments audit`** — Find empty segments, segments that haven't grown in 90 days, and segments not referenced by any recent campaign. Reads the segments endpoint and joins with member counts from the local SQLite store.

  _When cleaning up an audience or auditing segmentation hygiene, this surfaces what's dead in one call._

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli segments audit --list a1b2c3d4e5 --json
  ```
- **`attribution`** — Join a campaign's e-commerce product activity report with synced store orders to compute attributed revenue, top products by attributed revenue, and conversion rate (orders divided by opens).

  _When measuring whether a campaign drove revenue, this is the single command._

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli attribution 7f8a9b0c1d --store mystore --json
  ```
- **`deliverability`** — Roll up domain-performance reports across the last N campaigns. Surfaces per-domain (gmail.com, yahoo.com, outlook.com) bounce, spam, open, and click rates. Highlights domains performing below the account average.

  _When investigating a deliverability dip, this shows you which inbox providers are degrading without clicking through 10 separate report pages._

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli deliverability --last 10 --json
  ```
- **`compare`** — Side-by-side metric diff for two campaigns. Fetches both campaigns' report + email-activity in parallel, renders open rate / CTR / click-to-open / bounces / unsubscribes / revenue with a winner per metric, computes delta, and surfaces top differences (subject line, send time, audience size). --md renders as paste-ready markdown.

  _When you ask 'which campaign won?' or 'did the change work?', this is the single command. The --md mode pastes into a weekly review doc._

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli compare 7f8a9b0c1d 8c9d0e1f2a --md
  ```

### Operational safety
- **`send-checked`** — Run the official send-checklist before sending. Exits 2 with the failing items if any have type=error or is_ready=false; otherwise sends.

  _When sending campaigns from a pipeline, this is the safe default — broken campaigns don't ship silently._

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli send-checked 7f8a9b0c1d
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
mailchimp-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Add a subscriber with tags in one call

```bash
mailchimp-pp-cli subscribe alice@example.com --list LIST_ID --tags vip,onboarding --merge FNAME=Alice --merge LNAME=Smith
```

Composes PUT /lists/{id}/members/{md5} + POST /lists/{id}/members/{md5}/tags with the MD5 hash computed for you.

### Import 5,000 contacts from CSV via the batch endpoint

```bash
mailchimp-pp-cli bulk-subscribe --csv contacts.csv --list LIST_ID --tags newsletter --watch
```

Posts to /batches, polls until done, decompresses the tar.gz JSONL within the 10-minute expiring URL window, returns per-row outcomes.

### Check whether a campaign succeeded

```bash
mailchimp-pp-cli digest CAMPAIGN_ID --json --select campaign_id,open_rate,click_rate,top_links,top_products
```

Joins four report endpoints and lets --select dotted paths narrow the response to the fields an agent actually needs (Mailchimp's reports run >10KB each).

### Find stale segments to clean up

```bash
mailchimp-pp-cli segments audit --list LIST_ID --json
```

Surfaces empty segments, segments with no member growth in 90 days, and segments not used by any recent campaign.

### Gate a campaign send on the official checklist

```bash
mailchimp-pp-cli send-checked CAMPAIGN_ID
```

Runs /send-checklist first; if any item is type=error, exits 2 with the failing items printed and does not send. Use in CI to prevent broken campaigns shipping silently.

### Compare two campaigns head-to-head for a Monday review doc

```bash
mailchimp-pp-cli compare CAMPAIGN_A CAMPAIGN_B --md
```

Renders a side-by-side diff of open rate, CTR, revenue, and unsubscribes with the winner per metric. The --md output pastes into Notion or Slack.

### Weekly campaign rollup for a founder review

```bash
mailchimp-pp-cli digest --last 5 --md
```

Renders a multi-campaign summary table with aggregate stats. Marcus's Monday founder doc shape.

## Auth Setup

Mailchimp encodes the datacenter in the API key suffix. The key 'abc...xyz-us6' tells the CLI to route requests to 'us6.api.mailchimp.com.' Set MAILCHIMP_API_KEY and the CLI parses the suffix at startup. For OAuth tokens (no embedded suffix), set MAILCHIMP_DC=us1 explicitly or let 'mailchimp auth dc-lookup' resolve it from the metadata endpoint.

Run `mailchimp-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  mailchimp-pp-cli account-exports get --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries** — use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set — piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
mailchimp-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
mailchimp-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
mailchimp-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.mailchimp-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `MAILCHIMP_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `MAILCHIMP_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
mailchimp-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
mailchimp-pp-cli --profile briefing account-exports get
mailchimp-pp-cli profile list --json
mailchimp-pp-cli profile show briefing
mailchimp-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `mailchimp-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release, then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add mailchimp-pp-mcp -- mailchimp-pp-mcp
```

Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which mailchimp-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   mailchimp-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `mailchimp-pp-cli <command> --help`.
