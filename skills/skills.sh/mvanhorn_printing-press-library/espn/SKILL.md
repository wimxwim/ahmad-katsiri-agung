# ESPN — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `espn-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install espn --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `espn-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this when a user wants a quick sports lookup - current score, standings, upcoming schedule, head-to-head record, or a rich per-game summary (box score, leaders, scoring plays, odds, win probability). Also good for cross-league discovery (`today`) and offline search across synced data.

Don't reach for this if the user has a paid feed like Stats Perform or Sportradar that provides cleaner data, or if they need real-time websocket updates (ESPN's endpoints are polling-only). For betting odds in isolation, the per-game `summary` payload includes them but there is no league-wide odds command.

## Unique Capabilities

Commands that only work because of local sync + cross-league tooling.

### Cross-league discovery

- **`today`** — Today's scores across all major sports in one call. The fastest "what's on tonight" answer without picking a sport first.

- **`trending`** — Most-followed athletes and teams across all leagues, ranked by current popularity. Good for "who is hot right now" without naming a sport.

- **`dashboard`** — Reads `[favorites]` from `~/.config/espn-pp-cli/config.toml` and shows scores for each favorited team across leagues, in one call.

- **`watch <sport> <league> --event <game_id>`** — Live score updates for a specific game (polls every 30s). Use `scores` or `today` to find the game, then `watch` to follow it live.

### Game-state intelligence

- **`summary <sport> <league> --event <game_id>`** — Detailed game summary including box score, leaders, scoring plays, odds, and win probability. The single richest payload per game.

- **`boxscore <event_id>`** — Just the per-player box score for an event id, with sport+league inferred from a recent scoreboard cache hit. Pass `--sport`/`--league` to skip inference.

- **`plays <sport> <league> --event <id>`** — Play-by-play feed for a specific event. Optional `--limit` (default 200).

- **`recap <sport> <league>`** — Post-game recap with box score and leaders for the most recent completed game in a league.

- **`scoreboard <sport> <league>`** — Live scoreboard with date filtering, week/group selectors, and competition metadata.

- **`odds <sport> <league>`** — Spread, over/under, and moneyline lines for tonight's slate, derived from the scoreboard payload (no per-game summary calls).

### Standings and rankings

- **`standings <sport> <league>`** — Conference/division standings.

- **`rankings <sport> <league>`** — Current AP, Coaches, and CFP poll rankings (NCAAF/NCAAM).

- **`streak <sport> <league>`** — Current win/loss streaks across teams in a league, computed from synced data.

- **`rivals <sport> <league>`** — Head-to-head records between teams in a league from synced data.

- **`h2h <team1> <team2> --sport <s> --league <l>`** — Deeper head-to-head detail for one specific pair, including average score and recent meetings list.

- **`sos <sport> <league>`** — Strength-of-schedule per team, derived from the standings payload, sorted descending.

### People

- **`leaders <sport> <league> [--category <name>]`** — Statistical leaders across categories with optional filter.

- **`compare <athlete1> <athlete2> --sport <s> --league <l>`** — Side-by-side season stats for two athletes. Ambiguous names list candidates and exit 2.

- **`injuries <sport> <league>`** — Active injury report across the league, grouped by team.

- **`transactions <sport> <league>`** — Recent trades, signings, and waivers.

### Local store

- **`sync`** — Pull a sport+league dataset into local SQLite for offline analysis.

- **`search "<query>"`** — Full-text search across synced events and news.

- **`sql <query>`** — Run read-only SQL queries against the local database.

## Recipes

### Morning sports scan

```bash
espn-pp-cli today --agent --select events.shortName,events.status
espn-pp-cli scores football nfl --agent --select events.shortName,events.competitions.competitors.team.displayName,events.status.type.detail
espn-pp-cli standings football nfl --agent
```

One `today` call covers cross-league activity, one `scores` for the league you care about, one `standings` for context. The nested `--select` paths cut a scoreboard payload from tens of KB down to the fields that actually matter — essential for keeping agent context small.

### Pre-game research from synced data

```bash
espn-pp-cli sync --sport football --league nfl
espn-pp-cli rivals football nfl --agent         # historical records from synced data
espn-pp-cli streak football nfl --agent         # current streaks
espn-pp-cli summary football nfl --event <id> --agent   # full game payload incl. odds and box score
```

Run `sync` once, then `rivals` and `streak` answer instantly from the local store. `summary` is the richest single payload for a specific game (box score, leaders, scoring plays, odds, win probability).

### Offline search after sync

```bash
espn-pp-cli sync --sport football --league nfl
espn-pp-cli search "Mahomes"                    # finds in local store
```

Useful for repeated lookups in poor-connectivity environments or when batch-analyzing historical data.

### Favorites dashboard

Add a `[favorites]` block to `~/.config/espn-pp-cli/config.toml`:

```
[favorites]
nfl = ["KC", "BAL"]
nba = ["LAL"]
```

Then:

```bash
espn-pp-cli dashboard --agent
```

One call surfaces tonight's matchup status for every favorited team, grouped by league. Per-league fetches run in parallel and partial failures are reported alongside successful results.

### Pre-game odds and player digging

```bash
espn-pp-cli odds basketball nba --agent          # tonight's spreads / totals / moneylines
espn-pp-cli leaders basketball nba --category points --agent
espn-pp-cli compare "LeBron James" "Stephen Curry" --sport basketball --league nba --agent
espn-pp-cli boxscore <event_id> --agent          # post-game player stats
espn-pp-cli plays basketball nba --event <id> --limit 50 --agent
```

`odds` reads the scoreboard's per-event lines (no per-game summary calls). `leaders --category` filters to one stat category. `compare` resolves athlete ids by name, listing candidates and exiting 2 on ambiguity. `boxscore` infers sport+league from the most recent cache hit; pass `--sport`/`--league` to skip inference.

## Auth Setup

**None required.** ESPN's public endpoints don't require an API key. The `auth` command exists for consistency but is a no-op.

Optional config:
- `ESPN_CONFIG` — override config file path
- `ESPN_BASE_URL` — override base URL (for proxies or mirrors)
- `NO_COLOR` — standard no-color env var

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`. Use `--select` for field cherry-picking, `--dry-run` to preview requests, `--no-cache` to bypass GET cache.

### Filtering output

`--select` accepts dotted paths to descend into nested responses; arrays traverse element-wise:

```bash
espn-pp-cli <command> --agent --select id,name
espn-pp-cli <command> --agent --select items.id,items.owner.name
```

Use this to narrow huge payloads to the fields you actually need — critical for deeply nested API responses.


### Response envelope

Data-layer commands wrap output in `{"meta": {...}, "results": <data>}`. Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's `live` or local. The `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a TTY; piped/agent consumers see pure JSON on stdout.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error |
| 3 | Not found (team, game, athlete) |
| 5 | API error |
| 7 | Rate limited |

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-cli@latest
espn-pp-cli doctor
```

### MCP Server

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add espn-pp-mcp -- espn-pp-mcp
```

## Argument Parsing

Given `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → run `espn-pp-cli --help`
2. **`install`** → CLI; **`install mcp`** → MCP
3. **Anything else** → resolve `<sport> <league>` from user intent (e.g., "Lakers" → `basketball nba`), check `which espn-pp-cli` (offer install if missing), run with `--agent`.

## Automatic learning

Two-call protocol: `recall` before discovery, `teach &` before emitting. The CLI does entity-aware match validation AND surfaces stored playbooks for the query family; you read the envelope and follow the six-branch decision tree. Skipping either side costs you free recall hits in future sessions.

### Step 1: `recall` before any discovery

Before `scoreboard`, `teams`, `boxscore`, `search`, `standings`, or any other discovery command on a new user question, run:

```bash
espn-pp-cli recall "<user's question>" --agent
```

The response envelope:

```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "normalized": "game tonight",
  "query_entities": ["Niners"],
  "found": true | false,
  "match_score": 0.0,
  "results": [
    { "resource_id": "...", "resource_type": "events|news|...", "venue": "...",
      "confidence": 2, "entity_match": "exact|partial|unknown",
      "source": "taught|preseed|pattern", "warnings": ["..."] }
  ],
  "mismatches": [ /* only when --debug-mismatches */ ],
  "warnings": [ /* top-level */ ],
  "playbook": {
    "query_family": "...",
    "playbook": {
      "steps": [ { "cmd": "teams basketball nba {team.id}", "purpose": "..." }, ... ],
      "entity_slots": ["$TEAM", "$STATS"],
      "expected_tool_calls": 3
    },
    "slots_resolved": { "$TEAM": { "token": "pistons", "canonical": "Detroit Pistons" } },
    "notes": "byathlete needs seasontype=2; categories has dup labels"
  },
  "notes": "byathlete needs seasontype=2; categories has dup labels"
}
```

### Step 2: six-branch decision tree

Read `playbook`, `notes`, `results[0]`, and warnings in that order:

```
if Playbook present:
    -> READ Playbook.notes verbatim FIRST (workarounds + gotchas the CLI surface doesn't expose)
    -> replay Playbook.steps in order, substituting Playbook.slots_resolved entries
       for the entity slot tokens. If a step's slot is unresolved, fall back to
       discovery for that step only.
    -> the Playbook's expected_tool_calls is a budget; if you find yourself running
       materially more, record the divergence via teach-playbook at end-of-session.

elif Notes present (no Playbook):
    -> read Notes verbatim before any discovery step; they carry known gotchas
       for this query family even when no structured choreography exists yet.

elif Found AND Results[0].EntityMatch == "exact" AND Results[0].Confidence >= 2:
    -> skip discovery; fetch live data for Results[*].ResourceID in parallel
       (e.g., espn-pp-cli boxscore <eid> for an event, espn-pp-cli teams ... for a team)

elif Found AND Results[0].EntityMatch == "partial":
    -> candidate hint, NOT a hit; read the resource title to validate before trusting

elif (any row in Mismatches[] when --debug-mismatches was passed):
    -> treat as cold start; the stored learning is for a different entity
       (e.g., a "Cowboys" learning won't satisfy a "Niners" query — different canonical)

else:  // Found == false, no playbook, no notes
    -> cold start; run discovery normally; teach the answer afterward AND record
       a playbook + notes via teach --playbook-file --playbook-notes-file so the
       next session of the same family is faster.
```

Playbook and Notes are orthogonal to the per-resource path. A recall response can carry both a Playbook AND a Results[] hit — use both: the Playbook tells you which choreography to run; the resource hits short-circuit specific steps. Default to skipping `mismatches`; pass `--debug-mismatches` only when investigating cold-start surprises.

### Step 3: always read `warnings`

- `low_confidence`: row exists at `confidence<2`. Treat as a hint, not a skip-discovery hit.
- `resource_not_in_store`: the local store doesn't have the resource the learning points at. The match validator couldn't classify entities — direct-fetch and re-evaluate.
- Top-level `no_learnings_for_query_family`: the table had no rows above the Jaccard floor. Pure cold start.

### Step 4: `teach &` after finalizing your response

After assembling your user-facing response containing event/team IDs but BEFORE emitting it, fire the teach call in the background. Append a shell `&` so the call returns immediately and does not block the user-facing response:

```bash
espn-pp-cli teach --query "<user's question>" --resource-type <events|news|teams> --resource <id1> --resource <id2>
# (append shell `&` to background it)
```

Silent on success. Teach the **most specific** resource — if the user asked "when's next Spurs game" and you walked the teams scoreboard to find event `401747632`, teach that event ID, not the team ID. The CLI uses the seeded entity_lookups (NFL/NBA/MLB/MLS team rosters with aliases like Niners/49ers/SF) for cross-alias resolution at recall time, so a teach under "Niners" will satisfy future "49ers" queries automatically.

### Step 5: record a playbook when discovery took >5 calls

If you ran more than 5 tool calls to answer the question AND you discovered workarounds the CLI didn't surface (silently-dropped flags, undocumented params, pagination tricks, payload gotchas), record them so the next session of the same query family skips that discovery. Two surfaces:

```bash
# Common case: along with the resource teach
espn-pp-cli teach --query "<question>" --resource-type <type> --resource <id> \
  --playbook-file ~/playbooks/season-recap.json \
  --playbook-notes-file ~/playbooks/season-recap-notes.md
# (append shell `&` to background it)

# Standalone: notes-only or recipe-only
espn-pp-cli teach-playbook --query "<question>" \
  --playbook-file ~/playbooks/season-recap.json \
  --notes "byathlete needs seasontype=2; categories has dup labels"
```

Playbook files are JSON with `steps`, `entity_slots`, `expected_tool_calls`. Notes files are markdown carrying the gotchas verbatim. Either field may be empty; both empty is rejected. Playbooks are keyed on the structural query family (entities stripped) so a recipe taught from "how did Warriors end the season" applies to Pistons, Heat, and every other team query of the same shape.

When you DO find a playbook on a future recall, treat it as ground truth: replay the steps with `slots_resolved` substitutions, skip the discovery that the choreography already documents, and read `notes` before any step.

### Step 6: `playbook amend &` when your debug response identifies a correction

If your debug-protocol response identifies a concrete correction the notes or playbook should know — a workaround, an undocumented endpoint shape, a stale field name, observed schema drift, an empty-payload fallback — fire `playbook amend` BEFORE emitting your user-facing response. Same fire-and-forget posture as `teach`.

```bash
espn-pp-cli playbook amend \
  --query "<exact recall query string>" \
  --add-note "<your concrete correction>"
# (append shell `&` to background it)
```

What counts as worth amending: a behavior you OBSERVED this session that future-you would benefit from knowing. Examples worth amending:
- "summary endpoint wraps response in `{meta, results}` -- data lives at `.results.header`, not `.header`"
- "compare returns empty `team` field for athletes whose team isn't in current playoffs"
- "byathlete category index for avgRebounds drifted from general[9] to general[11] this season"

What does NOT belong in notes:
- The year-specific answer ("Curry shot 4-16 in his last game"). That's the response, not a learning.
- Per-team or per-athlete data that the playbook already retrieves at runtime.
- Statements that paraphrase what the existing notes already say.

The amend command appends to the family's existing notes with a timestamped marker (`[amend YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ]: <text>`). Multiple amends accumulate; the audit trail is visible. If no playbook exists yet for the family, amend creates a notes-only one (so cold-start corrections still land).

### Worked examples

1. **Cold: "when's next Spurs game?"** — `recall` returns `found=false`. Walk the teams scoreboard, find next upcoming Spurs event ID, answer. Teach the event:

   ```bash
   espn-pp-cli recall "when's next Spurs game?" --agent
   # found=false -> discovery
   espn-pp-cli teams basketball nba 24 --agent --select events.id,events.shortName,events.date
   # ...answer "Tue May 26 SA @ OKC, event 401747632"...
   espn-pp-cli teach --query "when's next Spurs game?" --resource-type events --resource 401747632
   # (append shell `&` to background it)
   ```

2. **Warm: "Niners game tonight"** — `recall` returns `found=true`, `results[0].entity_match="exact"`, `results[0].confidence>=2`. Skip discovery; fetch the box score directly:

   ```bash
   espn-pp-cli recall "Niners game tonight" --agent
   # found=true, results=[{resource_id: "401547432", entity_match: "exact"}]
   espn-pp-cli boxscore 401547432 --agent
   ```

3. **Cross-alias hit: "49ers game tonight"** — never directly taught. `recall` resolves "49ers" → "San Francisco 49ers" canonical via entity_lookups (nfl_team kind), finds the "Niners game tonight" learning (same canonical), returns `found=true`. Skip discovery.

4. **Entity mismatch: "Cowboys game tonight"** — has a Niners learning above the Jaccard floor on non-entity tokens (`game`, `tonight`), but the entity canonical differs (Dallas Cowboys ≠ San Francisco 49ers). Filtered into `mismatches`; recall returns `found=false`. Treat as cold start.

When the loop is broken: `learnings list --warnings` surfaces local issues; `espn-pp-cli feedback "<what tripped you up>"` records the friction so the next print can fix it.

## Agent Workflow Features

This CLI exposes three shared agent-workflow capabilities patched in from cli-printing-press PR #218.

### Named profiles

Persist a set of flags under a name and reuse them across invocations.

```bash
# Save the current non-default flags as a named profile
espn-pp-cli profile save <name>

# Use a profile — overlays its values onto any flag you don't set explicitly
espn-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>

# List / inspect / remove
espn-pp-cli profile list
espn-pp-cli profile show <name>
espn-pp-cli profile delete <name> --yes
```

Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.

### --deliver

Route command output to a sink other than stdout. Useful when an agent needs to hand a result to a file, a webhook, or another process without plumbing.

```bash
espn-pp-cli <command> --deliver file:/path/to/out.json
espn-pp-cli <command> --deliver webhook:https://hooks.example/in
```

File sinks write atomically (tmp + rename). Webhook sinks POST `application/json` (or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact` is set). Unknown schemes produce a structured refusal listing the supported set.

### feedback

Record in-band feedback about this CLI from the agent side of the loop. Local-only by default; safe to call without configuration.

```bash
espn-pp-cli feedback "what surprised you or tripped you up"
espn-pp-cli feedback list         # show local entries
espn-pp-cli feedback clear --yes  # wipe
```

Entries append to `~/.espn-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl` as JSON lines. When `ESPN_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `ESPN_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream (non-blocking — local write always succeeds).
