# FedEx — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `fedex-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install fedex --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `fedex-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/fedex/cmd/fedex-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Use fedex-pp-cli when you run a small-to-medium shipping operation and want to programmatically interact with the FedEx REST API. Right fit for: e-commerce stores creating labels from order CSVs, customer-service teams generating return labels, ops teams tracking in-flight shipments, and SMB owners who want a local ledger of every shipment and rate quote for accounting. The local SQLite archive makes it the right tool for analytical queries over historical shipments. Choose this CLI over multi-carrier SaaS (ShipStation, Shippo) when you only need FedEx, want to own your data, and prefer terminal/agent automation over web UIs.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Save money, save time
- **`rate shop`** — Quote rates across every applicable service type in parallel and rank by cost, transit days, or cost-per-day.

  _When picking the cheapest viable service for a shipment, this collapses 6+ API calls into one ranked answer. The headline cost-saving command for SMB shippers._

  ```bash
  fedex rate shop --from 90210 --to 10001 --weight 5lb --json --select rates.serviceType,rates.totalNetCharge,rates.transitTime
  ```
- **`ship bulk`** — Create labels for a CSV of orders with adaptive rate limiting, per-row PASS/FAIL accounting, and resume-from-last-success.

  _The 'I ship 30 packages a day' workflow. Replaces clicking through FedEx Ship Manager one label at a time._

  ```bash
  fedex ship bulk --csv orders.csv --service GROUND --output labels/ --resume
  ```
- **`return create`** — Generate a Ground Call Tag (return label) against an existing tracking number with one command, optionally emailing it to the recipient.

  _E-commerce customer-service workflow. Issuing a return label is the most common post-sale interaction._

  ```bash
  fedex return create --tracking 794633071234 --reason damaged --email customer@example.com
  ```
- **`address validate`** — SHA-256-keyed local cache prevents re-billing the FedEx Address Validation API for repeat lookups.

  _Direct cost savings — the only feature with a quantifiable per-call $ impact._

  ```bash
  fedex address validate --street '1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy' --city 'Mountain View' --state CA --zip 94043 --country US --cache
  ```
- **`ship etd`** — Single-command Electronic Trade Documents shipping: uploads commercial invoice, captures docId, and stitches it into the shipment create call.

  _International shipments require ETD; this collapses an error-prone multi-step into one atomic action._

  ```bash
  fedex ship etd --invoice invoice.pdf --orig CN --dest US --recipient-name 'Acme' --weight 2kg --service FEDEX_INTERNATIONAL_PRIORITY
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`address save`** — Save frequently-used recipients to a local address book; reference them by name in ship commands.

  _Ergonomic parity with paid SaaS competitors. Eliminates retyping addresses for repeat customers._

  ```bash
  fedex address save acme --street '500 Main St' --city Denver --state CO --zip 80202 --country US
  ```
- **`track diff`** — Show only the tracking events that have appeared since the last poll for each tracking number in the local store.

  _Replaces tracking-poll dedupe glue agents would otherwise write._

  ```bash
  fedex track diff --since 1h --json
  ```
- **`track watch`** — Continuously poll a set of tracking numbers and emit new events to stdout, a webhook, or a file as they arrive. Polling alternative to FedEx push notifications.

  _Most SMBs don't have provisioned push webhooks. Polling daemon is the universal alternative._

  ```bash
  fedex track watch --tracking 794633071234 --interval 10m --webhook https://example.com/hook
  ```
- **`archive`** — SQLite FTS5 search across every shipment in the local archive — recipient name, address, reference, tracking number, service.

  _'Did we ship to ACME last week?' — a question SMBs ask constantly._

  ```bash
  fedex archive 'warehouse 47' --service GROUND --json
  ```
- **`spend report`** — Sum of net charges per service type, lane, or account from the local rate-quote and shipment ledger.

  _'How much did I spend on FedEx last month?' — the question every SMB owner asks._

  ```bash
  fedex spend report --since 30d --by service --json
  ```
- **`export`** — Dump shipments + charges + tracking events as CSV or JSON for QuickBooks/Xero reconciliation.

  _Closes the loop on accounting reconciliation without manual data entry._

  ```bash
  fedex export --format csv --since 30d --output fedex-april.csv
  ```
- **`manifest`** — Generate a printable PDF/text summary of every shipment created today from the local archive, optionally invoking the Ground EOD close API.

  _Closes the warehouse-day workflow loop in one command._

  ```bash
  fedex manifest --date 2026-05-02 --close --output manifest.md
  ```
- **`sql`** — Direct SQLite SELECT queries against shipments, rate_quotes, tracking_events, address_validations, addresses tables.

  _Escape hatch for arbitrary analytics over the local ledger._

  ```bash
  fedex sql "select serviceType, count(*) as n, sum(net_charge) as spend from shipments where created_at > date('now','-30 days') group by serviceType order by spend desc"
  ```

### Setup smoothness
- **`doctor`** — Verifies OAuth auth, sandbox/prod routing, account-number format, label-format compatibility, and surfaces BAG (Bar Code Analysis Group) approval status.

  _Avoids the most common 'why won't my labels print' failure mode for first-time users._

  ```bash
  fedex doctor
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
fedex-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Rate-shop and select cheapest service

```bash
fedex rate shop --from 90210 --to 10001 --weight 5lb --json --select rates.serviceType,rates.totalNetCharge,rates.transitTime
```

Returns every applicable service type with cost and transit time so the agent (or human) picks the right balance.

### Bulk ship with resume

```bash
fedex ship bulk --csv orders.csv --service GROUND --output labels/ --resume --concurrency 2
```

Creates labels for every row in orders.csv, respects the FedEx 1 req/s burst limit via cliutil.AdaptiveLimiter, and resumes from the last successful row if interrupted.

### Save a recipient and ship to them

```bash
fedex address save acme --street '500 Main St' --city Denver --state CO --zip 80202 --country US
```

Address book lookup avoids retyping recipient details across every shipment.

### Issue a return label

```bash
fedex return create --tracking 794633071234 --reason damaged --json
```

Generates a Ground Call Tag against the original tracking; PDF/ZPL label is emitted for the customer.

### Monthly spend report by service

```bash
fedex spend report --since 30d --by service --json --select service,total_net_charge,shipment_count
```

Joins shipments + rate quotes from the local ledger; answers 'where did I spend money on FedEx this month'.

## Auth Setup

FedEx uses OAuth2 client_credentials. Run `fedex auth login` once with your sandbox or production Client ID and Client Secret; the CLI mints a 1-hour bearer token, caches it on disk, and refreshes proactively before expiry. Production label printing requires per-project Bar Code Analysis Group (BAG) approval from FedEx — `fedex doctor` surfaces approval status before you hit it.

Run `fedex-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  fedex-pp-cli addresses --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
fedex-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
fedex-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
fedex-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.fedex-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `FEDEX_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `FEDEX_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
fedex-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
fedex-pp-cli --profile briefing addresses
fedex-pp-cli profile list --json
fedex-pp-cli profile show briefing
fedex-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `fedex-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)
## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/fedex/cmd/fedex-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add fedex-pp-mcp -- fedex-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which fedex-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   fedex-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `fedex-pp-cli <command> --help`.
