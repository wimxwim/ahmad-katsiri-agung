# Pagliacci Pizza — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `pagliacci-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install pagliacci --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `pagliacci-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/food-and-dining/pagliacci/cmd/pagliacci-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent or user wants to interact with Pagliacci Pizza programmatically: browsing the menu, finding a store and time slot, building a half-and-half pizza, planning a small-party order, checking rewards balance, or replaying a past order. The CLI is built for households ordering for family or small parties.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`slices today`** — See which Pagliacci slices are available right now at every Seattle store, sorted by proximity to your saved address.

  _When the family asks 'what slices can we order tonight?', this returns a single comparable list — no per-store iteration needed._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli slices today --agent
  ```
- **`rewards stack`** — Compute the best application of stored coupons, reward redemption, and account credit for a given order total. Defaults to single-best-coupon + credit; multi-coupon stacking is flagged --experimental.

  _Family-size orders ($40+) hit reward thresholds where stacking actually saves real money — agents pick the optimal discount, not just the first valid coupon._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli rewards stack --order-total 55.00 --agent
  ```
- **`orders summary`** — Aggregate orders over a time range with top items, store breakdown, and order frequency.

  _See the household's pizza pattern — what we order most, which store, how often — for budgeting or just fun._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli orders summary --since 90d --agent
  ```

### Time-aware composed lookups
- **`store tonight`** — List stores that are still open and can deliver to your saved address right now, sorted by ETA.

  _Last-minute family dinner: only surface stores that will actually take the order tonight._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli store tonight --address-label home --agent
  ```
- **`address best-time`** — Resolve a saved address label to the next available delivery slot in one call.

  _Schedule delivery to land at family dinner time — no separate zone lookup or slot search._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli address best-time --label home --agent
  ```

### Order workflows
- **`orders reorder`** — Re-create a past order as a fresh cart, with price revalidation since prices change. Add --send to also submit.

  _Households have a usual order — replay it without rebuilding the cart line by line._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli orders reorder --last --dry-run
  ```
- **`menu half-half`** — Build a half-and-half pizza in one command, with each side's toppings validated against the menu and priced via ProductPrice.

  _Families with picky kids order half-and-half pies as the default. One command produces a sendable cart entry for the most common household pizza shape._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli menu half-half --left pepperoni --right cheese --size large --json
  ```
- **`orders plan`** — Given the number of people and a saved address, suggest a complete order plan: best store, delivery slot, sized cart contents, and the optimal discount stack.

  _Hosting 4–8 people: one command gives the agent everything it needs to confirm an order — no chained tool calls, no manual compose._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli orders plan --people 6 --address-label home --json
  ```

## Freshness Contract

This printed CLI owns bounded freshness only for registered store-backed read command paths. In `--data-source auto` mode, those paths check `sync_state` and may run a bounded refresh before reading local data. `--data-source local` never refreshes. `--data-source live` reads the API and does not mutate the local store. Set `PAGLIACCI_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` to skip the freshness hook without changing source selection.

Covered paths:

- `pagliacci-pp-cli address`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli address create`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli address delete`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli address get`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli address get_info`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli address list`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli address lookup`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli credit`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli credit delete`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli credit get`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli credit list`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli customer`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli customer access_devices_delete`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli customer access_devices_list`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli customer get`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli customer migrate_answer`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli customer migrate_question`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli gifts`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli gifts check`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli gifts delete`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli gifts get`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli gifts list`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli gifts transfer`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli gifts value`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli orders`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli orders clone`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli orders get`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli orders list`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli orders list_gift_cards`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli orders list_pending`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli orders suggestion`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli store`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli store compute_quote`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli store get`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli store get_quote`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli store list`
- `pagliacci-pp-cli store list_quotes`

When JSON output uses the generated provenance envelope, freshness metadata appears at `meta.freshness`. Treat it as current-cache freshness for the covered command path, not a guarantee of complete historical backfill or API-specific enrichment.

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
pagliacci-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### What can we eat tonight?

```bash
pagliacci-pp-cli slices today --agent --select store,slice,price
```

Returns today's available slices across all stores with just the high-gravity fields for fast agent decision making.

### Plan a small-party order for 6

```bash
pagliacci-pp-cli orders plan --people 6 --address-label home --json
```

Composes store proximity, delivery slot, sized cart, and discount stack into one recommendation.

### Build a half-and-half family pizza

```bash
pagliacci-pp-cli menu half-half --left pepperoni --right cheese --size large --json
```

Validates both halves against the menu and returns a priced, sendable cart entry.

### Replay last order

```bash
pagliacci-pp-cli orders reorder --last --dry-run --json
```

Pulls the most recent OrderListItem, transforms via OrderClone, re-prices, and returns a sendable cart without submitting.

### Maximize discount before checkout

```bash
pagliacci-pp-cli rewards stack --order-total 55.00 --agent
```

Computes the best application of saved coupons, reward redemption, and account credit for a given order total.

## Auth Setup

Pagliacci has no public API and uses a custom composed `PagliacciAuth {customerId}|{authToken}` header constructed from cookies. Run `pagliacci-pp-cli auth login --chrome` while logged into pagliacci.com in Chrome — the CLI reads the auth cookies and constructs the header for you. Public commands (menu, stores, slices, time-windows) work without login; authenticated commands (order history, rewards, saved addresses) require the Chrome session.

Run `pagliacci-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pp-cli address list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
pagliacci-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
pagliacci-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
pagliacci-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.pagliacci-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `PAGLIACCI_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `PAGLIACCI_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
pagliacci-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
pagliacci-pp-cli --profile briefing address list
pagliacci-pp-cli profile list --json
pagliacci-pp-cli profile show briefing
pagliacci-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `pagliacci-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)
## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/food-and-dining/pagliacci/cmd/pagliacci-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add pagliacci-pp-mcp -- pagliacci-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which pagliacci-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   pagliacci-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `pagliacci-pp-cli <command> --help`.
