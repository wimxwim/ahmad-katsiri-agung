# Cancer Variant Interpretation for Precision Oncology

Comprehensive clinical interpretation of somatic mutations in cancer. Transforms a gene + variant input into an actionable precision oncology report covering clinical evidence, therapeutic options, resistance mechanisms, clinical trials, and prognostic implications.

**KEY PRINCIPLES**:
1. **Report-first approach** - Create report file FIRST, then populate progressively
2. **Evidence-graded** - Every recommendation has an evidence tier (T1-T4)
3. **Actionable output** - Prioritized treatment options, not data dumps
4. **Clinical focus** - Answer "what should we treat with?" not "what databases exist?"
5. **Resistance-aware** - Always check for known resistance mechanisms
6. **Cancer-type specific** - Tailor all recommendations to the patient's cancer type when provided
7. **Source-referenced** - Every statement must cite the tool/database source
8. **English-first queries** - Always use English terms in tool calls (gene names, drug names, cancer types), even if the user writes in another language. Respond in the user's language

## LOOK UP, DON'T GUESS
When uncertain about any scientific fact, SEARCH databases first (PubMed, UniProt, ChEMBL, ClinVar, etc.) rather than reasoning from memory. A database-verified answer is always more reliable than a guess.

---

## COMPUTE, DON'T DESCRIBE
When analysis requires computation (statistics, data processing, scoring, enrichment), write and run Python code via Bash. Don't describe what you would do — execute it and report actual results. Use ToolUniverse tools to retrieve data, then Python (pandas, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib) to analyze it.

## When to Use

Apply when user asks:
- "What treatments exist for EGFR L858R in lung cancer?"
- "Patient has BRAF V600E melanoma - what are the options?"
- "Is KRAS G12C targetable?"
- "Patient progressed on osimertinib - what's next?"
- "What clinical trials are available for PIK3CA E545K?"
- "Interpret this somatic mutation: TP53 R273H"

---

## Input Parsing

**Required**: Gene symbol + variant notation (e.g., "EGFR L858R", "BRAF p.V600E", "EML4-ALK fusion", "HER2 amplification")
**Optional**: Cancer type (improves specificity)

Parse the gene symbol and variant separately. For fusions, use the kinase partner as the primary gene. For amplifications/deletions, use the gene name directly. Normalize common aliases: HER2 -> ERBB2, PD-L1 -> CD274, VEGF -> VEGFA.

## Phase 0: Tool Parameter Verification (CRITICAL)

**BEFORE calling ANY tool for the first time**, verify its parameters.

| Tool | WRONG Parameter | CORRECT Parameter |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `OpenTargets_get_associated_drugs_by_target_ensemblID` | `ensemblID` | `ensemblId` (camelCase) |
| `OpenTargets_get_drug_chembId_by_generic_name` | `genericName` | `drugName` |
| `OpenTargets_target_disease_evidence` | `ensemblID` | `ensemblId` + `efoId` |
| `MyGene_query_genes` | `q` | `query` |
| `search_clinical_trials` | `disease`, `biomarker` | `condition`, `query_term` (required) |
| `civic_get_variants_by_gene` | `gene_symbol` | `gene_id` (CIViC numeric ID) |
| `drugbank_*` | any 3 params | ALL 4 required: `query`, `case_sensitive`, `exact_match`, `limit` |
| `ChEMBL_get_drug_mechanisms` | `chembl_id` | `drug_chembl_id__exact` |
| `ensembl_lookup_gene` | no species | `species='homo_sapiens'` is REQUIRED |

## Clinical Reasoning Strategies

### Driver vs Passenger Reasoning

Not every mutation in a tumor is driving the cancer. Before querying databases, form a hypothesis:

- **Is this gene a known oncogene or tumor suppressor?** Genes like EGFR, BRAF, KRAS, TP53, PIK3CA are well-established cancer drivers. A mutation in one of these warrants deep investigation. A mutation in a gene with no known cancer role is likely a passenger.
- **Is this specific mutation recurrent across tumors (hotspot)?** Use cBioPortal to check. A mutation seen in hundreds of independent tumors (e.g., BRAF V600E) is almost certainly a driver. A unique, never-before-seen missense in the same gene is less certain.
- **What is the predicted functional impact?** Truncating mutations (nonsense, frameshift) in tumor suppressors are likely loss-of-function drivers. Missense mutations in oncogenes at known hotspot residues are likely gain-of-function drivers.
- **For unique (non-hotspot) missense in driver genes, look at mechanism, not just pathogenicity.** AlphaMissense gives a score; the ESMC-6B SAE composite `ESM_explain_variant_mechanism(sequence=wt_protein_seq, position=..., ref_aa=..., alt_aa=..., top_k_features=5)` answers *how* the substitution disrupts function — catalytic / ligand-binding / PTM / structural-stability loss. A unique missense that disrupts the same SAE feature category as a known driver hotspot in the same gene is more likely a driver than a missense that disrupts unrelated features. Requires `ESM_API_KEY`; missense only.
- **Conclusion pattern**: A recurrent mutation in a known driver gene is likely actionable. A unique mutation in a gene not associated with cancer is likely a passenger. State your assessment and the reasoning behind it.

### Actionability Reasoning

Actionable means a therapy exists that targets this alteration. Think in tiers based on evidence strength:

- **Tier 1**: FDA-approved drug for this mutation in this cancer type. The standard of care — recommend confidently. Example reasoning: "CIViC returns Level A evidence, FDA label confirms indication."
- **Tier 2**: FDA-approved for this mutation in a different cancer type, or strong clinical trial evidence (phase 2-3) in this cancer type. Reasonable to consider, especially under tumor-agnostic approvals or with molecular tumor board discussion.
- **Tier 3**: Preclinical evidence only — cell line data, animal models, or case reports. May justify clinical trial enrollment but not off-label use.
- **Tier 4**: Biological rationale but no direct evidence — the mutation is in a druggable pathway, or a structurally similar mutation responds to therapy. Hypothesis-generating only.

When synthesizing, state the tier and explain WHY you assigned it based on the evidence you found, not just which database returned a hit.

### Resistance Reasoning

If the patient has already been treated, ask: could this mutation be a resistance mechanism?

- **On-target resistance**: Mutations in the drug target gene itself that restore signaling despite drug binding. These typically emerge at the drug-binding site (e.g., EGFR T790M after erlotinib, EGFR C797S after osimertinib, ABL T315I after imatinib).
- **Bypass pathway activation**: Mutations in parallel signaling pathways that render the target irrelevant (e.g., MET amplification bypassing EGFR inhibition, BRAF activation bypassing MEK inhibition).
- **Phenotypic transformation**: Lineage changes (e.g., small cell transformation in EGFR-mutant lung cancer) that eliminate dependence on the original driver.
- **Timing matters**: If the mutation was detected AFTER treatment, it is more likely a resistance mechanism than if it was present at diagnosis.

### When to Use Which Tool

Form your clinical hypothesis FIRST based on gene function and mutation type, THEN use tools to validate:

- **CIViC** (`civic_search_genes`, `civic_get_variants_by_gene`): Your primary source for clinical evidence. Returns curated evidence items with evidence levels, clinical significance, and associated therapies. Start here for any variant with potential clinical relevance.
- **cBioPortal** (`cBioPortal_get_mutations`): Use to assess mutation prevalence — is this a hotspot? How common is it across cancer types? This informs your driver vs passenger assessment.
- **OpenTargets** (`OpenTargets_get_associated_drugs_by_target_ensemblID`): Use for actionability — what drugs target this gene? Cross-reference with CIViC evidence to assign tiers.
- **PubMed** (`PubMed_search_articles`): Use when CIViC lacks entries for your variant, or to find resistance mechanism reports and recent clinical trial results.
- **ClinicalTrials.gov** (`search_clinical_trials`): Use after establishing the variant is potentially actionable, to find enrollment opportunities.

## Fallback Strategy

When a primary tool returns no results, fall back rather than reporting "no data found":
- **CIViC empty** -> search PubMed for "[gene] [variant] clinical evidence"
- **OpenTargets no drugs** -> try ChEMBL drug search by target
- **cBioPortal specific study empty** -> try pan-cancer study (msk_impact_2017 or similar)
- **Reactome no pathways** -> use UniProt function annotation for pathway context
