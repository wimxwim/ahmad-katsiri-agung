## COMPUTE, DON'T DESCRIBE
When analysis requires computation (statistics, data processing, scoring, enrichment), write and run Python code via Bash. Don't describe what you would do — execute it and report actual results. Use ToolUniverse tools to retrieve data, then Python (pandas, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib) to analyze it.

# Regulatory Variant Analysis Skill

Systematic regulatory variant interpretation: discover trait associations from GWAS, map eQTL effects, annotate chromatin context, assess regulatory element overlap, and produce evidence-graded functional impact predictions for non-coding variants.

## When to Use

- "What GWAS associations exist for rs12913832?"
- "Find eQTLs for the APOE locus in brain tissue"
- "What regulatory elements overlap this variant region?"
- "Which SNPs are associated with type 2 diabetes from GWAS?"
- "Is this intronic variant in an active enhancer?"
- "What is the RegulomeDB score for rs429358?"
- "Find ENCODE histone marks at the BRCA1 promoter region"
- "Map trait ontology terms for 'blood pressure' to EFO IDs"

**NOT for** (use other skills instead):
- Coding variant pathogenicity -> Use `tooluniverse-variant-interpretation`
- Full clinical variant classification (ACMG) -> Use `tooluniverse-variant-interpretation`
- Gene-disease associations (not variant-specific) -> Use `tooluniverse-gene-disease-association`
- Pharmacogenomic variant annotation -> Use `tooluniverse-pharmacogenomics`
- Epigenomics data processing (BED/narrowPeak files) -> Use `tooluniverse-epigenomics`

## Non-Coding Variant Impact Reasoning

When evaluating a non-coding variant, build evidence across four questions:

**1. Is the variant in a regulatory element?**
Use RegulomeDB to assess whether the variant overlaps TF binding sites, chromatin accessibility peaks, or known regulatory annotations. A low RegulomeDB score (categories 1a-2a) indicates strong evidence that the position is functionally active. Confirm with ENCODE histone marks: H3K27ac signals active enhancers and active promoters; H3K4me1 alone marks poised enhancers; H3K4me3 marks active promoters; H3K27me3 marks silenced regions.

**2. Does it alter a transcription factor binding site?**
Check RegulomeDB's TF binding evidence and ENCODE TF ChIP-seq experiments. A variant that falls within a TF footprint and disrupts the consensus motif is mechanistically actionable, especially if the TF is known to be relevant in the disease tissue.

**3. Is there eQTL evidence linking it to a gene?**
Query GTEx to determine whether the variant (or variants in tight LD) modulates expression of a nearby gene in a tissue-specific or ubiquitous manner. A tissue-specific eQTL suggests cell-type-specific regulation; a ubiquitous eQTL suggests a core regulatory element. The direction of the NES (positive = alternative allele increases expression, negative = decreases) and effect size matter for interpretation.

**4. Is there GWAS evidence for trait association?**
Search the GWAS Catalog for the rsID or the surrounding locus. Genome-wide significant associations (p < 5×10⁻⁸) in relevant traits anchor the variant's biological importance. Cross-reference with OpenTargets for locus-to-gene mapping from multiple GWAS studies.

**Synthesizing the evidence**: Build a multi-layer case. A variant with GWAS significance + eQTL evidence + RegulomeDB score 1a-2a + active chromatin (H3K27ac) in the relevant tissue represents high-confidence regulatory impact. Two or three converging lines of evidence (e.g., eQTL plus active enhancer) constitute moderate confidence. A single line, or a variant only in a poised but not active regulatory context, represents lower confidence.

## Phase 0: Variant/Trait Resolution

Use `ols_search_terms` to resolve trait names to ontology IDs before GWAS queries. Restrict to `ontology="efo"` for GWAS traits; OpenTargets prefers MONDO IDs (e.g., MONDO_0005148 for type 2 diabetes rather than EFO_0001360). Use `EnsemblVEP_annotate_rsid` (param is `variant_id`, not `rsid`) for initial consequence annotation and nearest gene identification.

---

## Phase 1: GWAS Association Lookup

`gwas_search_associations` is the primary tool: accepts `disease_trait` (free text), `efo_id` (preferred for precision), `rs_id`, and `p_value` threshold. Use `p_value=5e-8` for genome-wide significance. For locus-level discovery, `gwas_get_variants_for_trait` retrieves all SNPs for a trait. `gwas_get_snps_for_gene` finds GWAS-cataloged SNPs mapped to a specific gene.

**Reasoning tip**: When GWAS Catalog returns empty for a free-text trait, switch to the `efo_id` parameter — the catalog uses controlled vocabulary and free-text matching is imprecise.

---

## Phase 2: eQTL Analysis

`GTEx_query_eqtl` accepts a gene symbol (auto-resolved to GENCODE ID) or Ensembl gene ID. It returns tissue-specific SNP-gene associations with NES (normalized effect size) and p-value per tissue.

When interpreting results, ask: does the eQTL effect occur in the tissue most relevant to the disease? A brain-specific eQTL for a neurodegenerative disease variant is more compelling than a ubiquitous one. Use `GTEx_get_median_gene_expression` to confirm that the target gene is actually expressed in the relevant tissue before placing weight on eQTL evidence.

**Note**: GTEx API uses v8 data; gtex_v10 endpoints may return empty for some queries.

---

## Phase 3: Regulatory Element Annotation

`RegulomeDB_query_variant` (param: `rsid`) returns a regulatory score and feature annotations. Scores in categories 1a–2a indicate strong regulatory evidence (eQTL overlap + TF binding + chromatin accessibility). Scores 3a–6 represent progressively weaker evidence.

`ENCODE_search_histone_experiments` accepts `histone_mark` (e.g., "H3K27ac") and `biosample_term_name` (tissue or cell line name — NOT a disease name; ENCODE uses biological sample names like "liver" or "breast epithelium"). Use `assay_title="TF ChIP-seq"` (not just "ChIP-seq") when querying TF binding data.

**Reasoning tip**: RegulomeDB aggregates ENCODE, Roadmap, and other data. If ENCODE doesn't have the specific biosample, RegulomeDB may still have aggregate evidence from related cell types.

When you have the variant as a GRCh38 coordinate, `FAVOR_annotate_variant(variant="chr-pos-ref-alt")` returns a regulatory annotation block (plus conservation, frequency, and CADD) in one call — use it to quickly confirm whether the position falls in an annotated regulatory element before drilling into RegulomeDB/ENCODE.

---

## Phase 4: OpenTargets GWAS Integration

`OpenTargets_search_gwas_studies_by_disease` takes `diseaseIds` as an array of MONDO IDs. It provides locus-to-gene (L2G) scores from multiple GWAS studies, which go beyond simple proximity to incorporate colocalisation, eQTL, and chromatin data. Use `OpenTargets_multi_entity_search_by_query_string` or `OpenTargets_get_disease_id_description_by_name` to resolve disease names to MONDO/EFO IDs first.

---

## Phase 5: Functional Impact Synthesis

After collecting evidence, reason through the layers:

- **High impact**: GWAS genome-wide significant + eQTL with meaningful NES + RegulomeDB score ≤ 2 + active chromatin (H3K27ac) in relevant tissue. Multiple independent lines converge on the same locus and gene.
- **Moderate impact**: Two to three lines of evidence (e.g., eQTL + active enhancer overlap, or GWAS significant + RegulomeDB ≤ 3) without full convergence.
- **Low impact**: Single line of evidence, or only computational annotation (VEP consequence category) without functional data.
- **No evidence**: No regulatory annotations in any source; the variant may be in a non-functional region or the relevant cell type is not represented in available datasets.

---

## Fallback Strategies

- **GWAS Catalog returns empty**: Switch from free-text `disease_trait` to `efo_id`; broaden the trait term.
- **GTEx eQTL empty for gene**: Verify gene symbol spelling; try Ensembl ID; increase `size` parameter.
- **RegulomeDB returns no data**: Query ENCODE directly, or run `FAVOR_annotate_variant` (GRCh38 coordinate) for its regulatory + conservation annotation; the variant may lack regulatory annotations in available data.
- **OpenTargets GWAS returns None**: Verify MONDO/EFO ID format; try `OpenTargets_multi_entity_search_by_query_string` first to confirm the correct ID.
- **ENCODE tissue not found**: ENCODE uses specific biosample names; RegulomeDB aggregates data from many cell types and may cover the gap.

## Limitations

- GWAS Catalog covers published GWAS only; unpublished studies are not included.
- GTEx eQTL data is from v8; v10 endpoints may return empty.
- RegulomeDB annotations depend on available ENCODE/Roadmap data for the specific cell type.
- eQTL analysis identifies correlation, not causation; fine-mapping is needed to identify causal variants.
- RegulomeDB scores are heuristic; a score of 1a does not guarantee functional impact.
- GWAS associations are population-level; individual variant effects depend on genetic background.
