# Pages: Signup / Login

Guides signup and login page structure, domain choice, modal vs dedicated page, discount integration, and SEO. Signup is the conversion endpoint from landing pages and pricing; when discounts apply at registration (e.g., student discount), signup is the P0 placement. Distinct from **landing-page-generator** (acquisition); **newsletter-signup-generator** (email capture only).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and offers.

Identify:
1. **Goal**: Account creation, trial, paid signup
2. **Discounts**: Student, annual, promo code—apply at signup?
3. **Auth**: Self-built vs third-party (Auth0, Clerk, etc.)
4. **Audience**: General vs segmented (students, startups)

## Domain & URL

| Option | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **Main domain** | /signup, /login, /auth; simple; common for SaaS |
| **Subdomain** | auth.example.com; Universal Login pattern; credentials not cross-origin; requires Cookie domain config for cross-subdomain session |
| **Third-party** | Redirect to Auth0, Clerk, etc.; provider hosts auth |

**Paths**: /signup, /login, /register, /auth; keep short and consistent.

## Modal vs Dedicated Page

| Approach | Use |
|----------|-----|
| **Dedicated page** | Account creation; discount verification; student verification; higher-quality leads; fewer fake emails |
| **Modal / popup** | Lightweight lead capture; newsletter; quick demo request; lower quality, higher volume |

**When discount applies at signup** (e.g., student 30% off): Use **dedicated page**—user needs space for verification, discount display, and form. Modal can work for simple email-only capture; avoid for full account + verification flows.

**Mobile**: Google penalizes intrusive interstitials; dedicated page avoids penalty.

## Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | Value-focused; "Start free" or "Students: 30% off today, 15% off ongoing" |
| **Trust signals** | SSL, payment logos, privacy, customer logos; see **trust-badges-generator** |
| **Media** | Product screenshot, short video, or demo GIF above fold; reinforces value |
| **Form** | Minimal fields; email first; social login (Google, GitHub) reduces friction |
| **Discount block** | Student discount, annual discount, promo code; verification entry when applicable |
| **Privacy / Terms** | Links; compliance |

## Discount Integration

### Student / Education (education-program)

| Element | Placement |
|---------|-----------|
| **Headline or subhead** | "Students: 30% off today, 15% off ongoing" |
| **Verification** | .edu, SheerID, UNiDAYS; verify at signup to apply discount |
| **Eligibility** | Brief eligibility; link to full terms |

**P0 placement**: When student discount applies at registration, signup page is primary; pricing page and homepage banner are P1.

### Other Discounts

- **Annual discount**: Show when user selected annual plan from pricing; confirm before submit
- **Promo code**: "Have a code?" link or inline field; validate before or after submit

## Form & Verification

- **Minimal fields**: Email only when possible; add name only if needed; see **newsletter-signup-generator**
- **Social login**: Google, GitHub; reduces friction; faster than email form
- **Verification entry**: .edu (instant), SheerID/UNiDAYS (broader); see **education-program**
- **Progressive**: Collect email first; verify student; then complete profile if needed

## SEO

| Page | Meta | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| **Login** | `noindex, nofollow` | No search value; security risk; indexed login pages can confuse users |
| **Signup** | `noindex, follow` | Block from SERP; allow crawl of links (Privacy, Terms) |

**Implementation**: Use `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` or `X-Robots-Tag` header. robots.txt does not prevent indexing—crawlers must access the page to read the directive. See **indexing** for full noindex page-type list.

## Output Format

- **Domain** and URL choice
- **Modal vs page** recommendation
- **Structure** (headline, trust, media, form, discount block)
- **Discount** integration (student, annual, promo)
- **SEO** meta tags
- **Related** skills for execution
