# Pages: Alternatives / Compare

Guides alternatives and comparison content that target "X alternatives" and "X vs Y" search intent. **Purpose**: Intercept competitor brand traffic—organic (SEO) and paid (brand keyword ads). High-intent, bottom-of-funnel; users searching alternatives are ready to switch. **Content format**: Standalone page (/alternatives, /alternatives-to-notion) or blog article (/blog/notion-alternatives). Same structure; blog builds topical authority.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Purpose & Keywords

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| **SEO** | Rank for "[Competitor] alternatives," "alternatives to [Competitor]," "[Competitor] vs [You]" |
| **PPC** | Bid on competitor brand + "alternative"/"vs"; send to alternatives landing page |
| **Intent** | High-intent; short sales cycle; users already understand the category |

**Keyword patterns**: alternatives, alternative, vs, comparison, compare, "best [X] alternatives." Include name variants (e.g., "SuccessBox" and "Success Box") in metadata.

## Competitor Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Obvious rivals | FreshBooks vs QuickBooks |
| **Bundlers** | Large platforms; users want lighter/cheaper | Salesforce, HubSpot → "cheaper Salesforce for SMB" |
| **Indirect** | Same problem, different solution | "Spreadsheet alternative" for accounting software |

Target all three for long-tail growth; don't only target the biggest competitor.

## Content Format: Page vs Blog Article

| Format | Path | Use |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Standalone page** | /alternatives, /alternatives-to-[competitor] | Dedicated hub; strong for your own product as alternative; **preferred for paid ads** (competitor brand keyword ads) |
| **Blog article** | /blog/[product]-alternatives, /blog/best-[x]-alternatives | Listicle format; common for affiliate, challenger brands; builds topical authority; **SEO/organic only** |

Both formats use the same structure (quick verdict, comparison table, individual reviews, FAQ). **For competitor brand keyword ads (Google Ads, etc.)**: use a **dedicated landing page**, not a blog. Users searching competitor brands expect direct alternatives; a blog increases bounce; a comparison page matches intent and converts better. Blog is for organic traffic and topical authority.

### URL Structure

- **Hub**: /alternatives
- **Per-competitor**: /alternatives-to-[competitor] or /[competitor]-alternative
- Short, keyword-rich, crawlable; no keyword stuffing

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for product, competitors, and differentiators.

Identify:
1. **Format**: Standalone page vs. blog article; single hub vs. per-competitor pages
2. **Competitors**: Who to include; avoid over-promoting direct rivals
3. **Primary goal**: Sign up, trial, demo; position as fair comparison
4. **Tone**: Objective, helpful; avoid disparaging competitors

## Page / Article Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | "Best [Product Category] Alternatives in [Year]" or "[Product] vs [Competitor]"; plain promise, avoid cute titles |
| **Problem-focused intro** | Empathy for pain; validate why they're searching; tease the payoff |
| **Quick verdict** | 5–8 lines above the fold: who it's for, top picks, decision shortcut |
| **Pros/cons of original** | Build trust; acknowledge why someone might leave; who should still keep it |
| **Comparison table** | Place early, not hidden; 4–6 columns (best for, price, ease, key limit); **HTML table** (not image)—required for AEO/GEO; scannable; section-level criteria and markup → **comparison-table-generator** |
| **Alternatives list** | 6–10 picks; each with "best for" label, proof, tradeoff, pricing snapshot |
| **Migration** | Link to migration-page if applicable |
| **FAQ** | "Is X better than Y?"; "Can I migrate from X?"; pricing, trials |
| **CTA** | Try free, start trial, book demo; one CTA above fold, one near end |

## Best Practices

### SEO

- **Intent**: Commercial; "alternatives to X," "X vs Y," "best X"
- **Title**: "[Product] Alternatives: Top [N] Options Compared | [Your Product]" or "Top [Competitor] Alternatives for [Year]: Better & Cheaper"; under 60 chars
- **Meta**: Lead with pain point or question; weave keyword early; end with benefit; max 160 chars
- **Content**: 1500+ words for alternatives hub; 800+ for single comparison
- **Internal links**: Link to features, pricing, migration, use cases

### Fairness & Trust

- **Objective tone**: Acknowledge competitor strengths; avoid FUD
- **Transparent criteria**: Explain how you compare (features, pricing, use case)
- **Update regularly**: Pricing and features change; date the comparison
- **Verifiable claims**: Link to pricing pages, docs; cite sources; add "as of [date]" for prices

### Conversion

- **Soft sell**: Position your product as one option; let value speak
- **Migration CTA**: "Switch in minutes" if migration is easy
- **Social proof**: Customer quotes from switchers

### AEO / GEO (AI Search)

- **HTML tables**: Use plain HTML for comparison tables; AI engines parse structured data; avoid images or fancy JS sliders
- **Structured data**: Objective entity mappings; bullets over prose for scannability; see **entity-seo**
- **Third-party validation**: G2, niche blogs mentioning you as alternative help AI cite you

### Brand Keyword Ads (PPC)

- **Use case**: Bid on "[Competitor] alternative," "[Competitor] vs [You]" when allowed by platform
- **Landing page**: Use a **dedicated alternatives/comparison page**, not a blog article. High-intent users expect direct alternatives; blog increases bounce. See **google-ads** Competitor Brand Keywords.
- **Ad-to-page alignment**: H1 mirrors search intent ("X vs [You]"); comparison table; one-line differentiator; strong CTA; see **landing-page-generator**, **paid-ads-strategy**

### Programmatic SEO (Scale)

- **When**: 50+ competitors; can't write manually
- **Data schema**: Price, key features, support level; store in API or headless CMS
- **Template**: One structure; populate per competitor; verify data quarterly (pricing changes)
- **Name variants**: Include "SuccessBox" and "Success Box" in metadata

### Measurement

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Assisted conversions** | User may convert later; attribution |
| **Bounce + pricing click** | Bounce to pricing = intent signal |
| **GEO share of voice** | Search "[Competitor] alternative" on Perplexity; are you cited? |
| **CTA clicks** | "Switch Now" button performance |

## Output Format

- **Competitor list** (Direct, Bundlers, Indirect)
- **Keyword list** (alternatives, vs, comparison; name variants)
- **Headline** and problem-focused intro
- **Comparison structure** (table columns, criteria; HTML table)
- **Per-competitor** summary (2–3 sentences each)
- **Your product** positioning
- **Internal links** (migration, features, pricing)
