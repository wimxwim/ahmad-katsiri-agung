# Pages: Blog

Guides blog page structure, SEO, and content marketing best practices.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for topics, audience, and keywords.

Identify:
1. **Blog purpose**: SEO traffic, thought leadership, product education
2. **Content mix**: Pillar pages, cluster content, news
3. **Audience**: Buyers, existing customers, developers

## Best Practices

### Blog Placement: Subdomain vs Subdirectory

| Option | Example | SEO / Use |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Subdirectory** | `example.com/blog` | SEO weight flows to main domain; recommended for product blogs |
| **Subdomain** | `blog.example.com` | Treated as separate entity; consider for distinct brands or technical isolation |

Choose based on SEO weight distribution, brand consistency, and technical architecture. See [Alignify subdomain vs subdirectory guide](https://alignify.co/zh/seo/create-blog) for details.

### Blog Index Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Featured/Recent** | Highlight newest or most important posts |
| **Categories/Topics** | Help users find by theme |
| **Editor's Picks** | Curate best content |
| **Related posts** | Per-article recommendations |
| **Search** | Help users find specific topics |

### Content Strategy

- **Topical authority**: Topic clusters -> pillar page per core topic + 6-12 cluster articles
- **Intent mapping**: Transactional, problem-aware, informational
- **EEAT signals**: Author bios, Organization schema, citations, changelog
- **Refresh > new**: For established sites, updating existing content often outperforms publishing new posts; avoid changing only the date without substantive edits
- **Quality > quantity**: Fewer high-quality posts beat many mediocre ones; consider deleting, merging, or refreshing underperformers
- **Topic focus**: Avoid blindly expanding topics; dilution can hurt authority on core topics
- **Conversion as north star**: SEO KPIs should tie to leads, signups, or sales -> not just traffic

### SEO

- **Title**: 55 chars, power words, primary keyword
- **Meta**: Clear CTA in description
- **Headers**: H1-H3 hierarchy, table of contents
- **Content depth**: 2,500+ words for pillars; Grade 8 readability
- **URL**: Use **url-slug-generator** -> clean slugs, 3-5 words, under 60 chars
- **Schema**: Article, BlogPosting, FAQPage where relevant

### Technical

### Design

- **Quick answers**: Definition boxes, mini-FAQs for AEO
- **TOC**: Table of contents for Featured Snippets; jump links in long articles; see **featured-snippet**, **toc-generator**
- **CTA placement**: Sidebar CTA or in-paragraph CTA at key conversion points
- **Related/Recent posts**: Manual curation or plugin; same topic cluster
