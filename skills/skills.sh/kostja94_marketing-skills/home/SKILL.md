# Pages: Homepage

Guides homepage content, structure, and conversion optimization.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Homepage Role & Purpose

| Role | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Conversion** | Primary | Homepage is a trust machine and conversion engine—not a sales pitch. Most visitors (70–80%) are first-time; they need clarity, credibility, and orientation within 3–5 seconds. Convert through trust-building and guided exploration, not aggressive selling. |
| **Brand** | Primary | First impression, credibility test, orientation center. Answers: Who are you? What do you offer? Why should I care? Brand voice and differentiation live here—see **branding**. |
| **Branded keywords SEO** | Required | Primary SEO goal: rank for brand name so people can find you in SERPs. Branded searches indicate high intent and familiarity; they convert better than non-branded. |
| **Broad/non-branded SEO** | Secondary | Homepage is not the main SEO traffic driver—blog, product pages, and category pages typically carry that. A well-optimized homepage can rank for related non-branded terms as a bonus; do not sacrifice UX or conversion for broad keyword stuffing. |

**Principle**: SEO and CRO work together. Good homepage SEO aligns with user needs; conversion optimization ensures attracted traffic converts. See **landing-page-generator** for single-goal campaign pages (homepage is multi-purpose).

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and value proposition. See **branding** for brand strategy, positioning, differentiation.

Identify:
1. **Primary goal**: Sign up, demo, purchase, learn more
2. **Audience**: Cold visitors, returning, specific segment
3. **Traffic source**: Organic, paid, referral

## Homepage Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Hero** | Value proposition, primary CTA, above the fold |
| **Social proof** | Logos, testimonials, metrics; "As Seen In" (press coverage) when applicable; see **customer-stories-page-generator** for case study snippets |
| **Features/Benefits** | What it does, why it matters |
| **Use cases** | Who it's for, how they use it |
| **Objection handling** | FAQ, guarantees, comparisons |
| **Final CTA** | Repeat primary action |

### Common Modules (from website-structure)

Combine as needed: Headline, Subheadline, Primary CTA, Supporting Image/Demo, Benefits Section, Social Proof, Search Box (if applicable), Secondary CTA, Banner. **Navigation**: Horizontal Bar, Dropdown, Hamburger (mobile), Sidebar, Footer; ensure Desktop + Mobile parity. See **hero-generator** for hero design.

## Best Practices

### Value Proposition

- **Clarity**: Visitor understands in 5 seconds
- **Specificity**: Concrete benefit, not vague
- **Differentiation**: Why you, not alternatives — see **branding** for positioning framework
- **Customer language**: Their words, not jargon
- **Avoid "not speaking human"**: Don't over-emphasize brand with vague definitions; communicate in user-friendly ways—if someone searches "AI presentation maker," the answer should be obvious from your headline

### CTA

- One clear primary action (avoid decision paralysis)
- Button copy: value-focused ("Start Free Trial") not generic ("Submit")
- Visible without scrolling
- Repeated at logical points

### Conversion Checklist

- Clear value proposition above the fold
- Single primary CTA; simplified navigation (5–7 menu items)
- Immediate social proof (reviews, trust badges, media logos)
- Mobile-first, fast-loading design

### Visual & Aesthetics

- **Frontend aesthetics**: For distinctive typography, motion, spatial composition, backgrounds—see **brand-visual-generator** Frontend Aesthetics

### SEO

**Branded keywords first**: Title and meta should include brand name; ensure homepage ranks for "[Brand Name]" so users can find the official site. See **brand-protection** when impersonation risk exists—place "Official website: [domain]" above fold or in hero.

- **Title tag** (50–60 chars): Brand name + primary keyword; e.g. "Canva – Free Website Builder"
- **Meta description** (150–160 chars): CTA + secondary keywords; engaging to encourage clicks
- **H1**: Value proposition or primary headline; one per page; include primary keyword naturally
- **Body**: Primary keyword in first 100 words; secondary keywords in H2–H6 and body
- Logical H2–H6 structure for scannability and LLM/AI Overview visibility

**Schema**: Add **Organization + WebSite** JSON-LD on homepage (or in root layout for site-wide). Organization establishes brand entity; WebSite enables sitelinks searchbox. Do not put Organization only on About page—About uses AboutPage schema. See **schema-markup**, **entity-seo**.

## Output Format

- **Structure** outline (sections)
- **Hero** copy options (headline, subheadline, CTA)
- **Key sections** content suggestions
- **SEO** metadata (title, description, H1)
- **Conversion** checklist
