# Pages: Article (Single Post)

Guides **structure, SEO, and UX** for individual article pages — layout, metadata, schema, technical. For **article body content** (intro, body, conclusion, writing), see **article-content**. Distinct from **blog-page-generator**, which covers the blog index/listing page.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

**Output workflow**: Always output in order: **0. Research Phase** (keywords, search intent, competitors) → **1. Intent Analysis** → **2. Content Analysis** → **3. Recommendations**. Do not skip steps. When Research Phase was performed via web search, show the search results and findings.

## Optimization Foundation: Four Inputs

Article analysis and creation rest on **four inputs**. Gather or infer them before outputting recommendations:

| Input | Purpose | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Product** | Product connection, features, use cases, CTA placement | project-context (Sections 1–4, 9–11); article content; web search |
| **Keywords** | Target keyword, primary/secondary placement | project-context Section 6; keyword-research; article |
| **Article intent** | Informational, commercial, transactional, navigational; drives structure, CTA, SEO depth | project-context Section 6 (target intent); article orientation; content type |
| **Competitor articles** | Structure to adopt, content gaps, length target, keyword opportunities | User-provided URLs; project-context Section 11; web search |

**When any input is missing**: Proactively ask or search. For article analysis: perform **Research Phase** (keyword search, search intent, competitor articles) by default — see Research Phase section. For product/keywords/intent, infer from article or prompt user to add project-context.

## Before Analysis: Gather Context

**1. Product / company context**

Use available context to give **tailored** analysis:

| Source | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| **project-context.md** | Keywords (Section 6), competitors (Section 7), content strategy (Section 11), product connection |
| **Article content** | Extract product name, features, URLs; infer target keyword and audience |
| **Web search** | When analyzing a known brand: search for "[product] features", "[product] vs competitors", company positioning — use to validate product connection, suggest missing features/use cases, and improve competitor gap analysis |

If no project-context exists, infer from the article and optionally search for company/product info to enrich recommendations.

## Research Phase: Keyword, Search Intent, Competitor (Required for Article Analysis)

**Lightweight** research for article analysis. When **analyzing or auditing** an article, perform searches and **output the results** in Section 0. Skip only if user explicitly asks to skip (e.g. "skip search").

- **Keyword**: Extract from article (title, H1, H2s, first 100 words); search for opportunities — see **keyword-research** (extract from article method)
- **Search intent**: Informational / Commercial / Transactional / Navigational — see **keyword-research** Search Intent
- **Competitor articles**: Fetch 2–3 top-ranking pages; analyze structure, gaps, length target — see **competitor-research** (Competitor Article Fetch Workflow)

**Output format**: See Output Format Section 0 below.

## Scope

- **Single article page**: One post, one URL (e.g. `/blog/how-to-optimize-seo`)
- **Not** the blog index, category pages, or archive pages — see **blog-page-generator** for those

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for topics, audience, keywords, and Section 11 (Content/Blog/Article Strategy).

Identify:
1. **Product connection**: How does this article support the product? (educate on problem, introduce features, nurture leads)
2. **Keyword basis**: Target keyword from product context or keyword research — see **keyword-research**
3. **Content type**: Blog post, guide, tutorial, news, evergreen
4. **Length**: Short (<1,000 words), medium (1,000–2,500), long (2,500+)
5. **Intent**: Informational, commercial, problem-aware

**Product-linked content**: Articles should tie to the product (problem it solves, features, use cases). Avoid purely generic content with no product relevance. Link to product/feature pages naturally in conclusion or when context fits.

## Article Orientations

Choose structure, SEO depth, and schema based on **orientation**. See **content-marketing** for full Article Orientations (Funding/PR, Product update, Guide, News, Evergreen), SEO-driven vs non-SEO-driven, Evergreen vs Timely.

**Intent Analysis output**: Orientation, primary goal, SEO vs non-SEO, Evergreen vs timely — see Output Format Section 1.

## Article Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Hero/Header** | Title (H1), author, **single date** (see **schema-markup** Date display for CTR), **reading time** (word count ÷ 200; round up), featured image, **share buttons** |
| **TL;DR or Key Takeaways** | See **article-content** for content; placed after intro; supports GEO/AI citation |
| **Introduction** | See **article-content** for hook, length, keyword placement |
| **Body** | See **article-content** for QAE, paragraph length, scannability |
| **Conclusion** | See **article-content** for summary, CTA, product connection |
| **Related posts** | 3–6 contextual links; end-of-article recommendations |
| **Author bio** | E-E-A-T; credentials, photo, link to author page — see **eeat-signals** |

### Featured Image

See **image-optimization** (Article / Blog hero). Same image for Schema, Open Graph, Twitter Cards; min 1200px wide, absolute URL. See **open-graph**, **twitter-cards**.

### Social Sharing

- Add **share buttons** (X, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) — see **social-share-generator**
- Place after intro and/or end of article; sticky sidebar for long-form
- Requires **Open Graph** and **Twitter Cards** for rich previews when shared

### GEO / AI Optimization

See **article-content** for TL;DR, Key Takeaways, QAE pattern, answer-first; **generative-engine-optimization** for full GEO strategy.

### Long-Form (1,000+ words)

- Add **table of contents** (TOC) after intro — see **toc-generator**
- Use jump links for major sections
- Break text with images, lists, definition boxes, mini-FAQs

## SEO Best Practices

### Title & Meta

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Title** | 55 chars; primary keyword near start; power words |
| **Meta description** | 150–160 chars; CTA; primary keyword |
| **H1** | One per page; matches title; primary keyword naturally |

### Keyword Placement

- **Title**: 1× primary keyword
- **First 100 words**: 1× primary keyword
- **Body**: 2–3× naturally; avoid stuffing
- **At least one H2**: Include primary or related keyword

### Content Quality

See **article-content** for readability, depth, originality, word count by type. **E-E-A-T**: Author bio, citations, changelog, expert quotes — see **eeat-signals**.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Multiple H1s; skipping heading levels (H2→H4); keyword stuffing in headings
- Neglecting conclusion or CTA; no internal links to related content
- Walls of text; generic "click here" anchors

### URL

Use **url-slug-generator** for slug creation. Key rules:

- **Slug**: 3–5 words; under 60 chars; primary keyword; lowercase, hyphens
- **Example**: `/blog/ai-people-search` not `/blog/ai-search-engine-finding-people-speed-discovery-outreach`
- **Avoid**: Date in path (`/blog/2025/01/15/article-title`); copy-pasting full title

### Date Display

See **schema-markup** (Date display for CTR): show only one visible date; prefer dateModified.

## Schema & Open Graph

See **schema-markup** for Article/BlogPosting/NewsArticle type selection, required properties, JSON-LD example, and date display. Validate with [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).

## Open Graph for Articles

Use `og:type: article` for article pages (not `website`):

```html
<meta property="og:type" content="article">
<meta property="og:article:published_time" content="2025-01-15T09:00:00Z">
<meta property="og:article:modified_time" content="2025-02-01T14:30:00Z">
<meta property="og:article:author" content="https://example.com/author/jane">
```

## Internal Linking

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Volume** | 3–5 contextual links in body + 3–6 in Related posts = 6–11 total per article |
| **First paragraph** | 1 link to pillar or key related content |
| **Body** | 2–4 contextual links; one per major section when relevant |
| **Related posts** | 3–6 end-of-article links; same topic cluster |
| **Anchor text** | Descriptive (e.g. "SEO checklist for 2025", "how to optimize meta tags"); avoid "click here", "learn more", "read more" |
| **Variation** | Mix exact-match, partial-match, branded anchors; avoid over-optimization |
| **Orphan prevention** | Every article has ≥1 internal link from hub/pillar or nav |

## Outbound Links (External)

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Volume** | 2–5 external links per article; cite authoritative sources |
| **When to use** | Statistics, research, definitions, tool comparisons, expert quotes |
| **Anchor text** | Descriptive (e.g. "Google's Search Quality Guidelines", "SEO study"); link to source |
| **Same URL** | Counts once per page for link equity; no need to repeat |
| **E-E-A-T** | External links to reputable sources signal trust — see **eeat-signals** |

## References / Citations

See **article-content** for citation format; **eeat-signals** for E-E-A-T and when to include.

## AI-Assisted Content

See **article-content** for AI-assisted content guidance; **eeat-signals** for E-E-A-T.

## Content Analysis

When auditing or optimizing an article, apply the Content Audit Checklist. See **article-content** for full dimensions.

## Output Format

### 0. Research Phase (output first, when analysis/audit is performed)

When analyzing or auditing an article, output this section **before** Intent Analysis. Include search sources and findings. If user asked to skip search, note that and infer from article only.

| Section | Output |
|--------|--------|
| **Keyword Search** | Primary keyword (from article or search), secondary keywords, keyword opportunities (from SERP/competitor analysis). If search was performed: query used, top results observed. |
| **Search Intent** | Intent for primary keyword (Informational/Commercial/Transactional/Navigational), intent for 2–3 secondary keywords, whether article content matches intent. If search was performed: SERP snippet types observed. |
| **Competitor Articles** | If searched: 2–3 URLs, brief structure (word count, H2s), content gaps, length target. If user provided URLs: same. See **competitor-research** for full methodology. If skipped: "Competitor analysis skipped." |

### 1. Intent Analysis (output second)

Before any recommendations, output a brief analysis:

| Dimension | Output |
|-----------|--------|
| **Orientation** | Funding/PR, Product update, Guide, News, Evergreen |
| **Primary goal** | Brand, PR, education, product adoption, organic traffic, … |
| **SEO vs non-SEO** | SEO-driven / Non-SEO-driven / Hybrid |
| **Evergreen vs timely** | Evergreen / Timely |
| **Implications** | 1–2 sentences: e.g. "Low SEO priority → focus on clarity, shareability" or "SEO-driven → full keyword + GEO optimization" |

### 2. Content Analysis (output third)

Apply the Content Analysis table above. Output a brief assessment per dimension (✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ + one-line note).

### 3. Recommendations (output fourth, tailored to intent)

Assign **priority** to each item: **P0** (critical), **P1** (high), **P2** (medium), **P3** (nice-to-have). Output as table or list with priority prefix.

| Priority | Use when |
|----------|----------|
| **P0** | Blocks GEO/SEO; missing core element (TL;DR or Key Takeaways, keyword in first 100 words, schema) |
| **P1** | Significant impact on traffic, CTR, or conversion (title length, share buttons, CTA) |
| **P2** | Improves UX or authority (related posts, author bio, internal links) |
| **P3** | Polish (image optimization, readability tweaks) |

Example: `[P0] Add TL;DR or Key Takeaways — GEO, AI citation`

- **Product connection** (how article supports product; where to link) — see **article-content**
- **Keyword** (target from product context or keyword research)
- **Structure** for article template (hero, TL;DR or Key Takeaways, intro, body, conclusion, related, author) — content creation: **article-content**
- **Featured image** (dimensions, alt, file size, og:image alignment)
- **GEO** elements (TL;DR or Key Takeaways, QAE pattern) — *skip or minimal for non-SEO-driven*
- **SEO** checklist (title, meta, H1, keyword placement) — *skip or minimal for non-SEO-driven*
- **Schema** type and JSON-LD
- **Internal links** (3–5 in body + 3–6 Related; anchor text suggestions; avoid "click here")
- **Outbound links** (2–5 external; cite stats, research; anchor text for each)
- **References** (inline citations vs Reference section; when to add for E-E-A-T)
- **Competitor analysis** (when URLs provided or searched): content gaps vs top rankers, structure to adopt, length target, keyword opportunities — see **competitor-research** for methodology; **Before Analysis** to prompt user or search
