# Components: Navigation Menu

Guides navigation menu design for SEO, UX, and accessibility. Navigation helps users find content and signals site structure to search engines.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for key pages and audience.

Identify:
1. **Site structure**: Main sections, hierarchy
2. **Primary goals**: Conversion paths, key pages
3. **Platform**: Web, mobile, both

## Structure & Organization

### Menu Size

- **Primary nav**: 7-9 items; avoid overwhelming users
- **Sub-navigation**: Up to 2 levels; deeper topics in sub-menus
- **Pattern**: Horizontal top nav or vertical side nav; avoid novel patterns

### Hierarchy

- Reflect sitemap structure; need not match exactly
- Prioritize what visitors need most
- Logical grouping by topic or task

## SEO Best Practices

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Semantic HTML** | `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`; proper landmark roles |
| **Descriptive anchor text** | Target keywords; avoid "Click here" |
| **Text links** | Prefer text over images; crawlers need readable links |
| **Initial render** | All nav HTML in first paint; no JS-only menus for critical links. See **rendering-strategies** |
| **Visible links** | Prefer visible over hidden; helps crawlers understand structure |

### Crawlability

- Sub-menus: Ensure HTML is in DOM (e.g., CSS-hidden, not JS-injected)
- Footer nav: Include secondary links
- Breadcrumbs: See **breadcrumb-generator** for implementation

## UX Guidelines

### Visibility & Location

- **Desktop**: Visible nav; avoid hiding behind hamburger when space allows
- **Expected placement**: Primary nav in header; footer nav at bottom
- **Current location**: Indicate active page/section in menu

### Accessibility

| Requirement | Practice |
|-------------|----------|
| **Labels** | Clear, intuitive wording |
| **Contrast** | 4.5:1 for link text |
| **Touch targets** | >=44x44px; adequate spacing |
| **Keyboard** | Full keyboard navigation; focus visible |
| **Screen readers** | Proper ARIA; skip links for long menus |

### Design

- Simple, clear; avoid covering entire screen with open menus on desktop
- Consistent across pages
- Mobile: Hamburger acceptable; ensure menu is usable when open

## Output Format

- **Structure** (primary items, sub-items)
- **Anchor text** suggestions
- **HTML/ARIA** notes
- **SEO** checklist
- **Accessibility** checklist
