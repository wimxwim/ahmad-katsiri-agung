# Pages: Pricing

Guides pricing page content, structure, and conversion optimization. Covers self-serve plans, enterprise/contact sales, API/usage-based pricing, and special programs (startups, education).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for product, audience, and pricing strategy.

Identify:
1. **Pricing model**: Subscription, one-time, usage-based, freemium, hybrid
2. **Plans**: Number of tiers, differentiation; enterprise vs self-serve
3. **Primary goal**: Sign up, contact sales, trial
4. **Objections**: Price sensitivity, "which plan?" confusion
5. **Special programs**: Startups, education, nonprofit (link or embed)
6. **Visibility**: Public page vs contact-sales-only; marketing site vs in-app

## Pricing Visibility & Placement

### Public vs Hidden Pricing

| Show public pricing | Hide (contact sales only) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Self-serve / SMB; standard tiers | Enterprise; highly customized |
| Competitive market; transparency differentiates | Premium positioning; consultative sales |
| Simple pricing model | New category; value exceeds cost in prospect's mind |
| 86% of B2B buyers want transparency; hidden pricing is a top deterrent | Custom deployments, SLA, volume; fixed price misleading |

**Middle ground**: "Starting from," price ranges, or calculator—clarity without rigid commitment.

### Where Pricing Lives

| Location | Audience | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Marketing site** | Unlogged visitors | Acquisition; standalone /pricing page; main nav or footer |
| **In-app / Dashboard** | Logged-in users | Subscription management; Settings → Billing/Subscription in sidebar; upgrade/downgrade, payment |

**Marketing site** = conversion; **In-app billing** = retention and plan management. Not all sites need public pricing in nav—enterprise-only products may use "Contact sales" as primary CTA.

## Pricing Models

| Model | Use |
|-------|-----|
| **Subscription** | Recurring; monthly/annual; most SaaS |
| **Freemium** | Free tier + paid; adoption then conversion |
| **Usage-based** | Pay per use; API calls, tokens, credits |
| **One-time** | Perpetual license; some tools |
| **Hybrid** | Base + usage; tiered + overage |

## Pricing Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | Value-focused; "Simple pricing" or benefit-led |
| **Pricing model selector** | Monthly/annual toggle; show annual savings (15–25%); usage-based calculator if applicable |
| **Plan comparison** | Clear table or cards; feature comparison; "Best for" per tier |
| **Enterprise / Contact sales** | Separate tier; "Contact us," "Custom pricing"; SLA, dedicated support; volume discount |
| **API / Usage pricing** | If API product: token/request pricing; tiers (Standard/Flex/Batch); overage; link to /api or docs |
| **Special programs** | Startups, education, nonprofit; link to startups-page or embed block |
| **FAQ** | Billing, cancellation, refunds, API limits, enterprise |
| **Social proof** | Testimonials, logos, "X companies trust us" |
| **CTA** | Per plan or unified "Get started"; "Contact sales" for enterprise |
| **Guarantee** | Money-back, free trial, no credit card |
| **Comparison** | Brief price vs alternatives; link to alternatives-page |

## Best Practices

### Plan Presentation

- **Tier design**: 2–4 tiers; avoid too many options; 3 tiers optimal (decoy effect)
- **Anchoring**: Lead with mid-tier or annual discount; anchor high to make mid-tier feel reasonable
- **Decoy effect**: Middle tier as "Goldilocks" choice; "Most popular" or "Best value" badge
- **Differentiation**: Clear "best for" per tier; value metric (seats, API calls, projects)
- **Feature clarity**: What's included; outcome-first ("Save 10 hours/week") over feature-first ("Advanced API"); avoid vague "Advanced features"
- **Price display**: Monthly vs annual; show savings explicitly
- **Comparison**: Help user choose (quiz, comparison table)

### Usage-Based & Credits

- **Consumption visibility**: Show credits/usage clearly; avoid "bill shock" from opaque consumption
- **Wording**: Avoid vague "Unlimited" if soft limits exist; use "Extended" or state limits explicitly

### Enterprise & API Pricing

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| **Enterprise** | Separate tier; "Contact sales," "Custom pricing"; SLA, dedicated support, volume discount |
| **API / Usage-based** | Token/request pricing; tier (Standard/Flex/Batch); overage; link to api-page or docs |
| **Hybrid** | Base subscription + usage; show base + overage clearly |

### Conversion Psychology

- **Anchor high**: Present highest tier first; mid-tier feels more reasonable
- **Loss aversion**: Money-back, no CC trial, cancel anytime—reduce perceived risk
- **Transparency**: No hidden fees; 73% of users value transparent pricing
- **Trust signals**: Logo, testimonial, "X+ companies"; guarantee near CTA

### Objection Handling

- **Price**: ROI, cost per use, comparison to alternatives
- **Commitment**: Free trial, no CC, cancel anytime
- **Uncertainty**: Guarantee, case studies, support

### Promo & Discounts

- **Annual discount**: Highlight 15–25% for annual prepay
- **Promo placement**: Top banner or promo block on page; see **top-banner-generator**
- **Startups/Education**: Link to startups-page or education-program page; or "Special plans" block on pricing page. When discount applies at registration, registration flow is P0; pricing page is P1. See **education-program** for placement priority.

### SEO

- Title: "Pricing | [Product]" or "Plans & Pricing"
- Meta: Include price range or "Start free" if applicable
- Schema: Consider Product/Offer structured data
