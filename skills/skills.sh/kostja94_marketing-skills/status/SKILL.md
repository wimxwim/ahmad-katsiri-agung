# Pages: Status Page

Guides status page design for communicating service health, uptime, and incidents. Typically at `status.*` subdomain. Reduces support during outages, builds trust.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for product and service components.

Identify:
1. **Service components**: API, dashboard, billing, etc.
2. **Monitoring**: What tools feed status (PagerDuty, Datadog, etc.)
3. **Audience**: Customers, developers, internal
4. **Hosting**: Self-hosted vs. third-party (Statuspage, Better Uptime, etc.)

## Status Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Overall status** | Operational, Degraded, Outage, Maintenance |
| **Components** | Per service: status, uptime % |
| **Incidents** | Active and past; timeline, updates |
| **Subscribe** | Email, SMS, RSS for notifications |
| **Uptime history** | 90-day or custom range (optional) |

## Best Practices

### Communication

- **Clear status**: Operational, Degraded, Partial Outage, Major Outage
- **Incident updates**: Timely, honest, actionable
- **Post-mortem**: Link to post-incident review when public
- **Maintenance**: Schedule ahead, notify subscribers

### Design

- **Scannable**: Status at a glance; green/yellow/red
- **Mobile**: Critical for on-the-go checks
- **Accessible**: Color + text; don't rely on color alone
- **No login required**: Public status, no auth

### Technical

- **Independent hosting**: Status page should stay up when main product is down
- **Subdomain**: status.yourdomain.com
- **Integrations**: Slack, PagerDuty, etc. for incident creation
- **Historical data**: Uptime %, incident count

## Output Format

- **Structure** (components, incident format)
- **Status** definitions and colors
- **Incident** template (title, updates, resolution)
- **Subscribe** options
- **Hosting** recommendation (self vs. third-party)
