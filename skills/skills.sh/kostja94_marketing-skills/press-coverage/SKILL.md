# Pages: Press Coverage

Guides press coverage and media mentions aggregation—showcasing third-party coverage from authoritative sites to build trust. Optional page; when coverage is sparse, implement as a small "As Seen In" or "As Featured In" section on homepage or elsewhere. Distinct from **media-kit-page-generator** (assets for journalists). For conceptual overview and comparison table, see [reference.md](reference.md).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read for company story and key messages.

Identify:
1. **Coverage volume**: Few mentions vs substantial
2. **Format**: Full page vs section
3. **Sources**: Publications, podcasts, awards, industry lists

## Full Page vs Section

| Format | When to Use | Placement |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Full page** | Substantial coverage (10+ mentions); journalists visit for expert contacts; "inbound PR" | /press, /news, /in-the-news |
| **Section** | Sparse coverage (1–10); quick credibility; logo strip or quote carousel | Homepage below hero; About page; footer |

**Rule**: Homepage section = logos only, minimal, below main CTA. Full page = headlines, links, dates, contact.

## Full Page Structure

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Coverage list** | Chronological or by publication; headline, outlet, date, link |
| **Separation** | Press coverage (third-party) vs press releases (company-authored); coverage carries more credibility |
| **Types** | News, podcasts, video features, awards, "Best X" lists |
| **Contact** | Media inquiries; link to media kit |
| **Dates** | Optional on evergreen content; omit to keep timeless |

## Section Structure ("As Seen In" / "As Featured In")

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Logos** | Publication logos; high-contrast, consistent size |
| **Placement** | Below hero/CTA; above fold or just below |
| **Quote** | Optional: one compelling snippet; extract from best coverage |
| **Link** | Optional: "See all coverage" → full page if exists |

**Avoid**: Clutter; too many logos; low-authority outlets that dilute trust.

## Content Types to Aggregate

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **News articles** | Forbes, Bloomberg, TechCrunch, industry trade |
| **Podcasts** | Interview features, guest appearances |
| **Video** | TV segments, YouTube features |
| **Awards** | "Best X 2024," "Top 10 Startups" |
| **Reviews** | Product reviews, roundups |

## Trust Principles

- **Third-party > self-authored**: Media mentions beat press releases for credibility
- **Authority matters**: Forbes, Bloomberg > unknown blogs
- **Recency**: Recent coverage signals active business; update regularly

## Output Format

- **Format** (full page vs section) recommendation
- **Structure** (elements, order)
- **Copy** (headline, intro if full page)
- **Placement** (URL, page location)
- **SEO**: Index for "company name press" / "company name news"; or noindex if thin
