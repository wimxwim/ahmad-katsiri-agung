# Components: Call-to-Action (CTA)

Guides CTA button design for conversion. A well-designed CTA can increase conversion by 25–10%.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for conversion goals.

Identify:
1. **Context**: Hero, form, pricing, product page
2. **User stage**: Awareness, consideration, decision
3. **Primary action**: Sign up, buy, trial, download

## Design Principles

### Visual Clarity

- **Look like buttons**: Background, border, corner radius, shadow
- **Stand out**: Contrasting color; clear hierarchy
- **Size**: ≥48×48px for touch; minimum 48px wide

### Hierarchy

- **Primary CTA**: One per section; impossible to miss
- **Secondary CTA**: Lower priority; visually distinct
- **Avoid**: Multiple competing CTAs causing choice overload

### Color & Shape

- **Color**: High contrast; red/orange for urgency
- **Shape**: Rounded = friendly; angled = dynamic
- **Accessibility**: →.5:1 contrast for text

## Copy Best Practices

- **Action-oriented**: "Buy," "Sign up," "Subscribe," "Get started"
- **Loss aversion**: "Claim Your Discount Before It's Gone" vs "Get 10% Off"; see **discount-marketing-strategy** for discount campaign design
- **Clear, no ambiguity**: User knows exactly what happens
- **Scarcity/urgency**: When appropriate; avoid overuse

## Placement

- **Above the fold** for primary actions
- **After value proposition**; build value before CTA
- **Near trust signals** (testimonials, badges)
- **Sticky/fixed** for long pages (use sparingly)

## Technical

- **Semantic HTML**: `<button>` or `<a>` with `role="button"` when needed
- **Visible focus state** for keyboard users
- **Loading state** for async actions: disable button during async operations; show spinner or loading text; prevent double-submit
- **cursor-pointer**: Add `cursor-pointer` to all clickable CTAs; default cursor on interactive elements is poor UX
- **aria-label**: Use `aria-label` for icon-only buttons (e.g., close, search); screen readers need descriptive labels
- **Hover stability**: Use color/opacity transitions (150–300ms); avoid scale transforms that shift layout

## Testing

- A/B test: color, copy, placement, size
- Measure: click-through rate, conversion rate

## Output Format

- **CTA copy** suggestions
- **Design** notes (color, size, hierarchy)
- **Placement** recommendations
- **Accessibility** checklist (cursor-pointer, aria-label, focus, loading state)
