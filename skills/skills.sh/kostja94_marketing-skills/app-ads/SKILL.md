# Paid Ads: App Ads

Guides app advertising: app install campaigns, user acquisition (UA), and in-app promotion. Use when promoting mobile apps (iOS, Android); conversion = install or in-app action, not landing page.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Key Platforms

| Platform | Best for | Conversion |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Google App Campaigns** | Android + iOS; automated across Search, YouTube, Display, Play, Discover | Install, in-app event |
| **Apple Search Ads (ASA)** | iOS only; high-intent App Store search | Install |
| **Meta App Install** | Facebook/Instagram; demand gen for apps | Install, in-app event |
| **TikTok App Install** | Younger users; viral creative | Install |

## Google App Campaigns

- **Reach**: Search, YouTube, Display, Google Play, Discover
- **Bidding**: Maximize Conversions (automated) or Target CPI/CPA (30+ conversions/week)
- **Creative**: Provide diverse assets (videos, images, text); algorithm tests combinations
- **iOS**: SKAdNetwork; conversion value mapping; Firebase for in-app events
- **Bid–budget ratio**: ≥10× for CPI, ≥15× for CPA

## Apple Search Ads

- **Placements**: App Store search results, Today tab, Search tab, product pages
- **Modes**: Basic (automated) or Advanced (keywords, audiences, bids)
- **Audience**: High-intent users actively searching in App Store
- **ASO benefit**: Can improve keyword rankings as secondary effect

## Metrics

| Metric | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **CPI** | Cost per install |
| **CPA** | Cost per acquisition (in-app action) |
| **LTV** | Lifetime value; iOS often higher than Android |
| **Retention** | D1, D7, D30; quality signal |

**iOS vs Android**: iOS typically higher LTV, higher CPI; Android greater scale, lower CPI.

## Tracking

- **Firebase**: In-app events, audiences, value-based optimization (Google)
- **SKAdNetwork**: iOS attribution; configure conversion value mapping
- **UTM**: Use `utm_medium=app` or `cpc` with `utm_source` for app campaigns in GA4
