# Pages: Features

Guides features page content, structure, and conversion optimization.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for product, differentiation, and proof points.

Identify:
1. **Feature set**: Core features, differentiators
2. **Audience**: Who evaluates features (buyer persona)
3. **Format**: Single page vs. per-feature pages
4. **Primary goal**: Demo, sign up, learn more

## Features Page Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | Benefit-led; "Everything you need to..." |
| **Feature grid/list** | Each feature: name, benefit, optional screenshot |
| **Use case links** | "For marketers," "For developers" |
| **Social proof** | Testimonials, logos |
| **CTA** | Try free, see demo, contact |

## Best Practices

### Benefit-First

- **Lead with benefit**: "Save 10 hours/week" not "Automated reporting"
- **Customer outcome**: What they get, not what it does
- **Specificity**: Numbers, examples, not vague claims

### Organization

- **By capability**: Group by product area or capability (e.g., Analytics, Automation, Integrations) — avoid organizing by use case to prevent overlap with use cases pages
- **By priority**: Most important/differentiating first
- **By journey**: Discovery -> evaluation -> decision

### Per-Feature Pages

- Use when features are substantial or rank separately
- Each page: feature name, benefit, how it works, proof
- Internal link from main features page

## SEO

- Title: "Features | [Product]" or "[Feature] | [Product]"
- H1: Main value; H2 per feature or section
- Schema: SoftwareApplication if applicable
- Internal links: To pricing, use cases, blog

### Avoid Overlap with Use Cases

- **Features = What**: Capability + benefit; no scenario narratives. Do not write "When you need to X..." — that belongs on use cases pages.
- **Link, don't duplicate**: Use "Use case links" (e.g., "For marketers," "For developers") to send users to use cases pages; do not replicate scenario content.
- **Content cannibalization**: Both target Commercial/Consideration; differentiate by angle (capability vs scenario) so each page serves unique intent.

## Output Format

- **Feature list** with benefit-first copy
- **Structure** (sections, order)
- **Headline** options
- **Per-feature** content (if separate pages)
- **SEO** metadata and schema

### vs. Tools

| Page | Purpose | Monetization |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Features** | Paid product capabilities; conversion | Primary revenue |
| **Tools** | Free utilities; lead gen; excerpt from product | Not primary; drives signups |
