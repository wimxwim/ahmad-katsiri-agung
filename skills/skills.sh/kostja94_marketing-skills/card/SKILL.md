# Components: Card Layout

Guides card layout design for scannable, responsive content display. Cards are self-contained containers that group related content; used in grids for blog posts, products, templates, tools, features, galleries, and integrations.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Card Anatomy

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Container** | Border, background, shadow; consistent padding |
| **Image / Thumbnail** | Visual anchor; consistent aspect ratio (1:1, 4:3 common) |
| **Title** | Clear; keyword-rich where relevant |
| **Description / Metadata** | Supporting text; date, author, category |
| **CTA** | Action button or link; "View," "Use," "Connect," etc. |

**Principle**: One card = one topic. Keep each card focused for scannability.

## Card Types by Use Case

| Type | Typical Elements | Page Skill |
|------|------------------|------------|
| **Product card** | Image, name, price, CTA (Add to cart, View) | **products-page-generator** |
| **Template card** | Thumbnail, name, short description, "Use" or "Preview" CTA | **template-page-generator** |
| **Tool card** | Name, one-line benefit, CTA to tool page | **tools-page-generator** |
| **Feature card** | Name, benefit, optional screenshot | **features-page-generator** |
| **Gallery / Showcase item** | Thumbnail, title, creator, link | **showcase-page-generator** |
| **Integration card** | Logo, name, short description, "Connect" or "Install" | **integrations-page-generator** |
| **Blog / Article card** | Cover image, title, excerpt, date, author | **blog-page-generator**, **article-page-generator** |
| **Resource card** | Thumbnail, title, format (guide, webinar), CTA | **resources-page-generator** |

## Layout & Responsiveness

- **Grid**: CSS Grid `repeat(auto-fill, minmax())` or Flexbox; columns adapt to viewport
- **Mobile**: Single column on small screens; 2–4 columns on desktop
- **Consistency**: Same padding, spacing, and aspect ratios across cards
- **Hover**: Subtle elevation (shadow, translate-y); avoid scale that causes layout shift (CLS)

## Design Principles

| Principle | Practice |
|-----------|----------|
| **Visual hierarchy** | Title > description > CTA; clear flow |
| **Scannability** | Minimal text; benefit-led copy |
| **Consistency** | Same structure across all cards in a grid |
| **Action clarity** | One primary CTA per card; avoid choice overload |

## SEO & Schema

- **Cards themselves**: No specific schema; layout is UI
- **Content in cards**: Use appropriate schema for the page (Product, Article, ItemList, etc.); see **schema-markup**
- **Images**: Alt text on thumbnails; see **image-optimization**
- **Links**: Descriptive anchor text; internal linking; see **internal-links**

## Grid vs List vs Masonry vs Carousel

| Layout | Best for | Skill |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Grid** | Visual content (products, templates, gallery); equal emphasis | **grid** |
| **List** | Text-heavy (blog index, docs); compact; scan by title | **list** |
| **Masonry** | Varying heights; image gallery, portfolio | **masonry** |
| **Carousel** | Limited space; testimonials, logos, featured rotation | **carousel** |
