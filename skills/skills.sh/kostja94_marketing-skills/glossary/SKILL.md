# Pages: Glossary

Guides glossary page structure, content, and internal linking for SEO.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for industry terms and customer language.

Identify:
1. **Domain**: SEO, marketing, tech, industry-specific
2. **Audience**: Beginners, practitioners, both
3. **Content volume**: Number of terms

## Best Practices

### Structure

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Alphabetical index** | A-Z or by category |
| **Term + definition** | Clear, concise explanation |
| **Related terms** | Cross-links within glossary |
| **Internal links** | Link to relevant blog/content |
| **Search** | Help users find terms |

### Definition Quality

- **Clear**: Jargon-free where possible
- **Concise**: One paragraph typical
- **Context**: How term is used in your domain
- **Examples**: When helpful

### Internal Linking Strategy

- **Anchor text**: Descriptive, keyword-rich; avoid "click here"
- **Variation**: Mix anchor phrases; don't repeat identical text
- **Placement**: Higher on page = more valuable
- **Relevance**: Link to most valuable next content
- **Avoid orphans**: Ensure every term page has inbound links

### SEO Benefits

- **Topic clusters**: Glossary as hub; links to and from pillar content; see **content-strategy**
- **Long-tail**: Definition queries, "what is X"
- **Crawlability**: Reduces depth; distributes authority
- **User engagement**: Helps users understand; keeps them on site

### Maintenance

- **New terms**: Add as content expands
- **Audit links**: Periodically check internal links
- **Update**: Keep definitions current

## Output Format

- **Structure** (index, layout)
- **Term** template (definition format)
- **Internal linking** plan
- **SEO** metadata
- **Schema**: DefinedTerm or similar if applicable
