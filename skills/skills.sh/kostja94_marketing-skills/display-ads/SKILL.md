# Paid Ads: Display / Banner

Guides display advertising: ad networks, banner ads, and programmatic buying. Use when placing ads on publisher sites (websites, apps) for brand awareness or retargeting.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## What Is Display / Banner

- **Ad networks**: Aggregate inventory from many publishers; buy placements programmatically or via direct deals
- **Banner ads**: IAB standard sizes (300×250, 728×90, 160×600, 320×50 mobile); static or animated
- **Programmatic**: Automated buying via DSPs; real-time bidding (RTB); audience targeting

## Formats

| Format | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **Display banner** | IAB sizes; CPM or CPC; brand, retargeting |
| **Native** | Blends with page content; higher engagement |
| **Video pre-roll** | Pre-roll on publisher video; see **ctv-ads** for streaming |
| **Rich media** | HTML5; expandable, interactive |
| **Mobile interstitial** | Full-screen between content |

## Buying Options

| Option | Use |
|-------|-----|
| **Google Display** | Part of Google Ads; automated placements; retargeting |
| **Programmatic DSP** | The Trade Desk, Magnite, etc.; audience-based; scale |
| **Direct publisher** | Deal with specific site; guaranteed placement |
| **Ad network** | Network aggregates inventory; simpler than full programmatic |

## Metrics

| Metric | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **CPM** | Cost per thousand impressions |
| **CPC** | Cost per click |
| **CTR** | Click-through rate; typically low for banners (0.1–0.5%) |
| **Viewability** | % of impressions actually seen |
| **Completion rate** | For video; % who watch full ad |

## Creative

- **IAB sizes**: 300×250 (medium rectangle), 728×90 (leaderboard), 160×600 (skyscraper), 320×50 (mobile)
- **File types**: Static image, animated GIF, HTML5
- **Message**: Clear CTA; minimal text; brand visible in 3 seconds
