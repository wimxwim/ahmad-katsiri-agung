# Components: List Layout

Guides list layout design for linear, stacked content display. Lists are compact, text-heavy; users scan by title or metadata. Used for blog indexes, documentation, search results, and dense content.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## When to Use List

| Use list when | Use grid when |
|---------------|---------------|
| Text-heavy; scan by title | Visual content; equal emphasis |
| Many items; compact display | Fewer items; browsing |
| Blog index, docs, search results | Products, templates, gallery |
| F-pattern reading (top-left, left column) | Discovery, exploration |

See **grid** for grid layout; **card** for card structure.

## List Structure

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Items** | Single column; stacked vertically |
| **Per item** | Title, optional metadata (date, author), excerpt, link |
| **Spacing** | Consistent gaps; dividers or alternating background |
| **Density** | Compact (docs) vs relaxed (blog) |

## List Variants

| Variant | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Simple list** | Title + link; minimal (nav, TOC) |
| **Rich list** | Title, excerpt, date, author | Blog index |
| **Table-like** | Columns for metadata (date, status) | Docs, admin |
| **With thumbnail** | Small image + text | Blog with thumbnails |

## Best Practices

| Principle | Practice |
|-----------|----------|
| **Scannable** | Clear titles; consistent hierarchy |
| **Compact** | Less vertical space than grid |
| **Link area** | Full row or title clickable |
| **Metadata** | Date, author, category; secondary styling |

## F-Pattern

Users read top-left first, then scan left column. Place primary content (titles) left-aligned; metadata secondary.

## Infinite Scroll

If using infinite scroll for list (e.g., blog index, search results): crawlers cannot access content loaded on scroll. Provide paginated component pages or use traditional pagination for SEO-critical content. See **site-crawlability** for search-friendly infinite scroll implementation.

## Responsive

- **Mobile**: Single column; full-width items
- **Touch targets**: ≥44×44px for touchable rows
- **Truncation**: Long titles; ellipsis or wrap by design
