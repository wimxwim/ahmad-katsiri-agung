# Components: Trust Badges

Guides trust badge design and placement for conversion. Trust badges borrow authority from third-party organizations to signal legitimacy and reduce purchase anxiety.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for key partners and certifications.

Identify:
1. **Site type**: E-commerce, SaaS, lead gen
2. **Available badges**: Security, payment, reviews, guarantees
3. **Placement goals**: Hero, checkout, product pages

## Badge Types & Impact

| Type | Best Placement | Conversion Impact |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Security** (SSL, Norton, McAfee) | Checkout, payment forms | +15–10% for unfamiliar brands |
| **Payment logos** (Visa, PayPal, Stripe) | Checkout, cart | +8→2% trust |
| **Money-back guarantee** | Product, checkout | +6–10% |
| **Reviews/ratings** (Trustpilot, BBB) | Product, hero | +12→8% |
| **Privacy/compliance** (GDPR, CCPA) | Forms, checkout | Data-sensitive transactions |

**"Trusted by" logos**: Client/customer logos in hero or footer; social proof for B2B. **"As Seen In"** (press coverage): Publication logos; see **press-coverage-page-generator** for media mentions aggregation.

## Best Practices

### Quantity

- **3→ badge types max**; more can cause "badge bloat" and reduce conversions by 5→%
- Quality over quantity; use only legitimate, verifiable badges

### Placement

- **Highest leverage**: Cart and checkout (near payment fields)
- **Product pages**: Near add-to-cart button
- **Hero**: "Trusted by" logos for brand credibility
- **Footer**: Secondary trust signals

### Authenticity

- Use only real, verifiable badges
- Fake or irrelevant badges create skepticism
- Link to verification where appropriate

## Design Guidelines

- Consistent size and style; don't mix clashing visuals
- **Image optimization**: Alt text, format—see **image-optimization**
- Adequate spacing; avoid clutter
- Grayscale or muted for "Trusted by" logos (don't compete with primary content)
- Ensure badges are recognizable at display size

## Accessibility

- Provide `alt` text for badge images (e.g., "Norton Secured")
- Don't rely on badges alone for critical information

## Output Format

- **Badge recommendations** by type and placement
- **Placement map** (hero, product, checkout)
- **Quantity** guidance (avoid bloat)
