# Pages: Resources

Guides resources page and content hub structure for discovery and SEO.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read it for content themes and audience.

Identify:
1. **Content types**: Blog, guides, webinars, templates, tools (or standalone /tools; see **tools-page-generator**)
2. **Audience**: Buyers, users, both
3. **Funnel stage**: Top, middle, bottom

## Best Practices

### Purpose

- **Help buyers buy**: Content that supports decision-making
- **Help users succeed**: How-to, best practices
- **SEO**: Organize for discoverability and topical authority

### Structure

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Categories** | By topic, format, or funnel stage |
| **Filters** | Format (blog, guide, video), topic, date |
| **Featured** | Highlight key assets |
| **Search** | Help users find specific content |
| **Contextual embeds** | Resource tiles on product pages |

### Navigation

- **Visible**: Resources in main nav or top-level section
- **Not buried**: Higher than content hubs in hierarchy
- **Clear labels**: "Resources," "Learn," "Content Library"

### Organization

- **Avoid junk drawer**: Intentional structure; not a catch-all
- **Logical hierarchy**: Folders, tags, categories
- **Internal linking**: Connect related content

### Integration

- **Product pages**: Embed relevant resources (streams, tiles)
- **Landing pages**: Lead magnet (ebook, template) or webinar as resource; LP exchanges value for email
- **Blog**: Part of resources or separate with cross-links
- **Glossary**: Link from resources

## Tools Integration
