# Components: Social Share Buttons

Guides implementation of **share buttons** that let users share the current page (article, post, product) to social platforms. Distinct from **social profile links** (footer links to your brand's X, LinkedIn, etc.) — share buttons share *this* content.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Scope

- **Share buttons**: Share current page URL to X, LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.
- **Not** social profile links (e.g. "Follow us on X") — those live in footer/nav

## Why It Matters

- Websites with visible social share icons tend to see higher social engagement
- Share buttons amplify reach; Open Graph and Twitter Cards control preview — see **open-graph**, **twitter-cards**

## Placement (Article Pages)

**Fewer, better-placed buttons outperform scattered placement.** Research: removing 80% of buttons and repositioning the remaining 20% at high-emotion moments can **3× conversion** on share actions.

| Placement | Best For | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **After first paragraph** | Most articles | Catches speed-readers; visible early |
| **Sticky sidebar** | Long-form (desktop) | Always visible; consider hiding on mobile |
| **Below title / hero** | Short posts | High visibility |
| **End of article** | All | Natural completion point; pair with CTA |
| **Mid-article** (after key insight) | Long content | Place at friction points (after surprising stat, before CTA) |

**Avoid**: Dozens of icons; every platform when audience uses 2–3. Choose 3–5 platforms that match your audience (e.g. B2B: X, LinkedIn; B2C: X, Facebook, WhatsApp).

## Share URLs (Intent Links)

Use platform share/intent URLs so users share with one click:

| Platform | Share URL pattern |
|----------|-------------------|
| **X (Twitter)** | `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url={url}&text={text}` |
| **LinkedIn** | `https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url={url}` |
| **Facebook** | `https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u={url}` |
| **WhatsApp** | `https://wa.me/?text={url}%20{text}` |
| **Telegram** | `https://t.me/share/url?url={url}&text={text}` |

Encode `url` and `text` with `encodeURIComponent()`. Use page title or a short pre-written message for `text` — **platform-specific prompts with pre-written messages perform ~4× better than generic icons**.

## Platform Brand Guidelines (Icons)

Use official brand assets. Minimum sizes and color rules:

| Platform | Min size | Colors | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Facebook** | 16px | Blue #1877F2 or monochrome | No rotation, animation without permission |
| **X (Twitter)** | 32px | Black or white only | Use current X logo, not deprecated bird |
| **LinkedIn** | 21px height | Blue #0A66C2 or monochrome | Use "in" bug for icons |
| **Instagram** | 29×29px | Black, white, or official gradient | Glyph for social icons |

Source icons from official brand resource centers. Outdated or non-compliant icons reduce perceived shareability.

## Design & Technical

| Item | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| **Format** | SVG preferred (scalable, small); PNG/WebP with fallback |
| **Performance** | Lightweight; avoid heavy share plugins that slow LCP |
| **Accessibility** | `aria-label="Share on X"`; keyboard accessible |
| **Mobile** | Touch targets ≥44×44px; consider native share API (`navigator.share`) on mobile |

## Native Share API (Mobile)

On supported browsers, `navigator.share` lets users share via system dialog (includes more apps). Fallback to intent links when unsupported:

```javascript
if (navigator.share) {
  navigator.share({ title, url, text }).catch(() => {});
} else {
  window.open(shareUrl, '_blank', 'noopener');
}
```

## Output Format

- **Placement** recommendation for page type
- **Platforms** to include (3–5)
- **Share URL** examples with placeholders
- **Icon** guidelines (size, source)
- **Accessibility** checklist
