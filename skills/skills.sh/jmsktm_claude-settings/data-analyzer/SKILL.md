## Data Visualization Best Practices

### Chart Selection Guide

| Data Type | Use Case | Chart Type |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Single continuous variable | Distribution | Histogram, density plot, box plot |
| Continuous over time | Trend | Line chart, area chart |
| Part-to-whole | Composition | Pie chart (if <6 categories), stacked bar |
| Comparing categories | Comparison | Bar chart, column chart |
| Two continuous variables | Relationship | Scatter plot |
| Three+ variables | Multivariate | Bubble chart, small multiples |
| Geographic data | Spatial patterns | Map, choropleth |
| Hierarchical data | Structure | Tree map, sunburst |

### Design Principles
- **Clarity:** Remove chart junk; focus on data
- **Accuracy:** Don't distort scales or proportions
- **Efficiency:** Maximize data-ink ratio
- **Aesthetics:** Use consistent colors and fonts
- **Accessibility:** Consider color-blind friendly palettes

## Best Practices

- **Start with questions:** Define what you're trying to learn before diving into data
- **Document assumptions:** Be explicit about data limitations and analytical choices
- **Check your work:** Verify calculations and logic; look for errors
- **Visualize early and often:** Charts reveal patterns that tables hide
- **Consider context:** Data doesn't exist in a vacuum; understand the business context
- **Beware of spurious correlations:** Correlation ≠ causation; think critically
- **Communicate uncertainty:** Use confidence intervals, p-values, and error bars
- **Tell a story:** Numbers alone don't drive action; insights do
- **Iterate:** Analysis is rarely linear; be prepared to loop back
- **Validate with stakeholders:** Ensure insights align with domain expertise

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **P-hacking:** Testing multiple hypotheses and only reporting significant ones
- **Cherry-picking data:** Selecting data that supports a predetermined conclusion
- **Ignoring assumptions:** Using statistical tests without checking prerequisites
- **Confusing correlation and causation:** Assuming A causes B because they correlate
- **Overfitting:** Building overly complex models that don't generalize
- **Ignoring missing data:** Assuming data is missing at random when it's not
- **Misinterpreting p-values:** P-value is not the probability hypothesis is true
- **Focusing on statistical vs. practical significance:** Tiny effects can be "significant" with large samples
- **Data snooping:** Looking at data before deciding on analysis approach
- **Extrapolating beyond data range:** Making predictions outside observed ranges
