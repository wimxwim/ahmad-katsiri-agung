## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Invoke /agent-workflow — it contains workflow principles, anti-patterns, and the **Context Gathering Protocol**. Follow the protocol before proceeding — if no workflow context exists yet, you MUST run /teach-maestro first.

This is the final quality pass. The workflow works — now make it excellent.

### Refinement Checklist

**Prompts**

- [ ] Every prompt follows the 4-zone pattern (role, context, instructions, output)
- [ ] Output schemas are explicit and validated
- [ ] Negative instructions clarify what NOT to do
- [ ] No contradictory instructions
- [ ] Few-shot examples included for ambiguous tasks
- [ ] Chain-of-thought used for multi-step reasoning tasks

**Tool Descriptions**

- [ ] Every tool has a multi-line description: what, when to use, when NOT to use, returns
- [ ] Input parameters have descriptions and types
- [ ] Error responses are documented
- [ ] At least one example input/output in the description

**Error Messages**

- [ ] Error messages are specific (not "an error occurred")
- [ ] Error messages suggest corrective action
- [ ] Errors include context (what was being attempted)
- [ ] Errors are structured (code + message + details)

**Logging**

- [ ] Every model call is logged (input tokens, output tokens, latency, cost)
- [ ] Tool calls are logged with inputs and outputs
- [ ] Errors are logged with full context
- [ ] PII is redacted from logs
- [ ] Workflow ID traces through all log entries

**Configuration**

- [ ] All magic numbers are named constants
- [ ] Environment-specific values are in config, not code
- [ ] Defaults are sensible — config is for overrides
- [ ] Cost ceilings are set
- [ ] Timeout values are set for all external calls

### Output

For each checklist item that fails, provide:

1. What's wrong (specific finding)
2. Where it is (file, line, or component)
3. How to fix it (concrete suggestion)
4. Priority (critical / important / nice-to-have)

### Priority Matrix

| Priority | Criteria | Maestro Action |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Critical | Affects correctness or safety | `/fortify` or `/guard` before shipping |
| Important | Affects quality or maintainability | `/calibrate` in current cycle |
| Nice-to-have | Cosmetic or minor inconsistency | Note for next `/refine` pass |

### Recommended Next Step

After refinement is complete, run `/evaluate` to verify the polished workflow against realistic scenarios.

**NEVER**:

- Skip the checklist — go through every item
- Mark items as passing without checking
- Suggest changes that alter behavior (this is polish, not redesign)
- Refine before the workflow is functionally correct (fix first, refine last)
