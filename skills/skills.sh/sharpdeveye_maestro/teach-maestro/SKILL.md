## BOOTSTRAP — First Command to Run

This is the entry point for Maestro. It creates the `.maestro.md` context file that all other Maestro commands depend on. No other preparation is needed — this IS the preparation.

---

You are conducting a structured interview to understand this project's AI workflow setup. Be conversational but thorough.

### Interview Questions

Ask these questions one section at a time. Wait for answers before proceeding.

**Section 1 — Models & Providers**

- What AI model(s) are you using? (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, local models)
- Are you using APIs directly or through a framework? (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom)
- What are your context window sizes?

**Section 2 — Workflow Architecture**

- Describe your current workflow at a high level (what goes in, what comes out)
- Do you have multiple agents/steps, or is it a single-agent system?
- What tools/functions are available to your agent(s)?

**Section 3 — Quality & Evaluation**

- How do you currently evaluate output quality?
- Do you have test cases or golden examples?
- What are the most common failure modes?

**Section 4 — Constraints**

- What are your cost constraints? (budget per request, per day)
- What are your latency requirements? (real-time, batch, async)
- Are there compliance requirements? (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, etc.)

**Section 5 — Priorities**

- Rank these from most to least important: Quality, Speed, Cost, Safety
- What's the single biggest workflow problem you want to solve?

### Output Format

After gathering all answers, generate a `.maestro.md` file:

```markdown
# Maestro Workflow Context
Generated: [date]

## Models & Providers
[answers from section 1]

## Workflow Architecture
[answers from section 2]

## Quality & Evaluation
[answers from section 3]

## Constraints
[answers from section 4]

## Priorities
[answers from section 5, with ranked priorities]
```

Save this file to the project root as `.maestro.md`.

### Context Completeness

| Section | Status | Impact if Missing |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Models & Providers | ? | Commands can't tailor advice to your stack |
| Workflow Architecture | ? | Commands can't assess complexity |
| Quality & Evaluation | ? | `/iterate` and `/evaluate` less effective |
| Constraints | ? | `/guard` and `/accelerate` can't set limits |
| Priorities | ? | All commands default to generic guidance |

### Interview Checklist

- [ ] All 5 sections asked and answered
- [ ] Answers are specific (not vague)
- [ ] `.maestro.md` file generated and saved
- [ ] User confirmed accuracy of the generated context

### Recommended Next Step

After creating `.maestro.md`, run `/diagnose` for a baseline health check of your workflow.

**NEVER**:

- Skip questions — every section matters for downstream commands
- Make assumptions — ask if unclear
- Overwrite an existing `.maestro.md` without asking
