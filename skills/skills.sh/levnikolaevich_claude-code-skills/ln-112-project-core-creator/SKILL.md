# Project Core Documentation Creator

**Type:** L3 Worker

L3 Worker that creates 4 core project documentation files. These are ALWAYS created regardless of project type.

## Purpose & Scope
- Creates 4 core project documentation files (required for all projects)
- Receives Context Store from ln-110-project-docs-coordinator
- Heavy use of auto-discovery (architecture needs full project scan)
- Replaces placeholders with project-specific data
- Self-validates structure and content (16+ questions)
- Never gathers context itself; uses coordinator input

## Invocation (who/when)
- **ln-110-project-docs-coordinator:** ALWAYS invoked as second worker (after ln-111)
- Never called directly by users

## Inputs
From coordinator:
- `contextStore`: Full Context Store with all discovered data
  - PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
  - TECH_STACK (full object: frontend, backend, database, etc.)
  - DEPENDENCIES (from package.json)
  - SRC_STRUCTURE (folder analysis)
  - EXTERNAL_SYSTEMS (from .env.example)
  - CODE_CONVENTIONS (from eslint, prettier)
  - ADR_LIST (from docs/reference/adrs/)
- `targetDir`: Project root directory

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `references/docs_quality_contract.md`, and `references/markdown_read_protocol.md`.
Optional rule catalog: load `references/docs_quality_rules.json` only when exact rule IDs, path matrices, or allowlisted placeholder exceptions are needed.

## Documents Created (4)

| File | Target Sections | Questions | Auto-Discovery |
|------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| docs/project/requirements.md | Functional Requirements (FR-XXX-NNN format) | Q23 | Low |
| docs/project/architecture.md | 11 arc42 sections with C4 diagrams | Q24-Q34 | High |
| docs/project/tech_stack.md | Frontend, Backend, Database, Additional | Q35-Q38 | High |
| docs/architecture/patterns_catalog.md | Pattern summary, 4-score model, trend tracking | — | High |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Receive Context
1. Parse full Context Store from coordinator
2. Validate required keys (PROJECT_NAME, TECH_STACK)
3. Extract architecture-specific data (SRC_STRUCTURE, DEPENDENCIES)

### Phase 2: Create Documents
For each document (`docs/project/requirements.md`, `docs/project/architecture.md`, `docs/project/tech_stack.md`, `docs/architecture/patterns_catalog.md`):
1. Check if file exists (idempotent)
2. If exists: skip with log
3. If not exists:
   - Copy template from `references/templates/`
   - `docs/project/requirements.md`: derive requirements from current product/project sources and normalize to FR-XXX structure
   - `docs/project/architecture.md`: derive structure from current source tree, ADRs, and runtime boundaries; generate diagrams from live code facts
   - `docs/project/tech_stack.md`: derive versions and rationale from current dependencies and config files
   - `docs/architecture/patterns_catalog.md`:
     - Copy template from `references/templates/patterns_template.md`
     - **Auto-detect patterns in the current codebase:**
       - Grep("Queue|Worker|Job|Bull") → Job Processing
       - Grep("EventEmitter|publish|subscribe") → Event-Driven
       - Grep("Cache|Redis|Memcached") → Caching
       - Grep("CircuitBreaker|Retry") → Resilience
     - Add detected patterns as "Status: Detected" (not yet audited)
     - Link to existing ADRs if pattern names match
     - Mark: `<!-- Auto-detected by ln-112, audit with ln-640 -->`
   - Replace `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` with Context Store values
   - Preserve the shared opening contract: `SCOPE`, `DOC_KIND`, `DOC_ROLE`, `READ_WHEN`, `SKIP_WHEN`, `PRIMARY_SOURCES`
   - Preserve the standard top sections: `Quick Navigation`, `Agent Entry`, `Maintenance`
   - Generate C4 diagrams from SRC_STRUCTURE (for architecture.md, if no legacy diagrams)
   - Insert ADR links (for architecture.md Section 8)
   - Never leave template markers in published project docs
   - If data is missing: omit the claim or use a concise neutral fallback, but do NOT emit `[TBD: ...]`

### Phase 3: Self-Validate
For each created document:
1. Check SCOPE tag and metadata markers in the opening block
2. Check required top sections (`Quick Navigation`, `Agent Entry`, `Maintenance`)
3. Check required sections (from questions_core.md)
4. Validate specific format requirements:
   - requirements.md: FR-XXX identifiers, MoSCoW labels
   - architecture.md: 11 sections, C4 diagrams, ADR references
   - tech_stack.md: versions, rationale for each technology
5. Check docs-quality contract compliance (no forbidden placeholders, no leaked template metadata, valid doc kind/role)
6. Auto-fix issues where possible

### Phase 4: Return Status
Return to coordinator:
```json
{
  "created_files": ["docs/project/requirements.md", "docs/project/architecture.md", "docs/project/tech_stack.md", "docs/architecture/patterns_catalog.md"],
  "skipped_files": [],
  "quality_inputs": {
    "doc_paths": ["docs/project/requirements.md", "docs/project/architecture.md", "docs/project/tech_stack.md", "docs/architecture/patterns_catalog.md"],
    "owners": {
      "docs/project/requirements.md": "ln-112-project-core-creator",
      "docs/project/architecture.md": "ln-112-project-core-creator",
      "docs/project/tech_stack.md": "ln-112-project-core-creator",
      "docs/architecture/patterns_catalog.md": "ln-112-project-core-creator"
    }
  },
  "validation_status": "passed",
  "diagrams_generated": 3
}
```

## Critical Notes
- **Idempotent:** Never overwrite existing files
- **Heavy auto-discovery:** architecture.md requires deep project analysis
- **C4 diagrams:** Generated from SRC_STRUCTURE in Mermaid format
- **ADR integration:** Section 8 links to docs/reference/adrs/
- **arc42 compliance:** ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 structure
- **Publishable output:** Core project docs must not contain `[TBD: ...]`, `TODO`, or leaked template metadata

### NO_CODE_EXAMPLES Rule (MANDATORY)
Documents describe **contracts and decisions**, NOT implementations:
- **FORBIDDEN:** Code blocks > 5 lines, function implementations, imports, DI configuration
- **ALLOWED:** Mermaid diagrams, component tables, method signatures (1 line), ADR links
- **INSTEAD OF CODE:** Reference source: "See src/Services/UserService.cs:45"
- **TEMPLATE RULE:** All templates include `<!-- NO_CODE_EXAMPLES: ... -->` tag - FOLLOW IT

### Stack Adaptation Rule (MANDATORY)
- Links must reference stack-appropriate docs (Microsoft for .NET, MDN for JS)
- Never mix stack references (no Python examples in .NET project)

### Format Priority (MANDATORY)
Tables > Mermaid/ASCII diagrams > Lists > Text

## Runtime Summary Artifact

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `references/docs_generation_summary_contract.md`

Accept optional `summaryArtifactPath`.

Summary kind:
- `docs-generation`

Required payload semantics:
- `worker = "ln-112"`
- `status`
- `created_files`
- `skipped_files`
- `quality_inputs`
- `validation_status`
- `warnings`

Write the summary to the provided artifact path or return the same envelope in structured output.
