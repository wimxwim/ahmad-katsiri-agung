# Test Coverage Analysis

A reference manual for choosing, applying, and interpreting test-coverage analyses on an existing test suite.

This skill is a **knowledge reference**, not a procedure. It does not tell you when to write tests or which test types to design — that is the job of `design-testing-strategy`. It tells you, once tests exist, **which mechanical signal best measures what those tests do (and do not) exercise**, and how to read that signal honestly.

## What Coverage Analysis Is

Test coverage analysis is the **post-hoc measurement** of how thoroughly a test suite exercises a software artifact along one or more **axes**. It answers the question *"what did my tests actually touch?"* — for some specific definition of "touch."

The word "coverage" is overloaded. It can mean any of:

- **Structural / code coverage** — which lines, statements, branches, conditions, or paths in the source code were executed (measured by instrumentation).
- **Mutation coverage** — what proportion of deliberately-injected source faults the test suite detects (measured by re-running the suite against mutated code).
- **Requirements / feature coverage** — which acceptance criteria, user stories, or specification clauses have at least one verifying test (measured by traceability).
- **API / integration coverage** — which endpoints, methods, status codes, contract interactions, and schema fields are exercised (measured by request/response inspection).
- **Specification-domain coverage** — equivalence classes, boundary values, parameter combinations, state transitions, error paths (measured by analyzing test inputs against a model).

### Category correction: coverage is not a test type

Mutation testing, MC/DC, branch coverage, RTM linkage, contract coverage, and schema coverage are **measurements about** an existing test suite. They are **not** test types in the way unit, integration, e2e, contract, or smoke tests are.

- "Should I write a unit test or a mutation test?" is a malformed question. The correct framing is: *"I already have unit/integration tests; should I additionally run mutation analysis against them?"*
- Mutation tools generate variants of the source and re-execute the **existing** suite. They produce a score, not new tests.
- MC/DC and branch coverage are reports computed from instrumented runs of the **existing** suite.
- RTM linkage is a property of test metadata (tags, IDs), not a separate execution.

If a "test strategy" places mutation testing alongside unit / integration / e2e, that strategy has confused *what to test* with *how to measure the tests*. The two questions are orthogonal.

### The asymmetry principle

**Low coverage is strong evidence of weak testing. High coverage is weak evidence of strong testing.**

Coverage is *necessary-but-not-sufficient*. A test can execute a line without asserting anything meaningful; 100% line coverage is routinely achievable with zero assertions ([thinkinglabs.io](https://thinkinglabs.io/articles/2022/03/19/the-fallacy-of-the-100-code-coverage.html), [codeintelligently.com](https://codeintelligently.com/blog/ai-generated-tests-false-confidence)). Use coverage as a **tripwire**, not a **trophy**. Once a coverage percentage becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric (Goodhart's law applied to testing; see [Optivem Journal](https://journal.optivem.com/p/code-coverage-targets-recipe-for-disaster)).

### What coverage analysis is NOT

- **NOT a measure of test quality.** Lines can execute without assertions.
- **NOT a measure of correctness.** Coverage proves the test ran, not that it would have failed on a bug.
- **NOT a synonym for "well tested".** Mutation testing routinely refutes 100%-coverage-with-no-assertions suites.
- **NOT a substitute for risk-based test selection** per [ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_29119).
- **NOT a target.** Treat as a floor and a trend, never as the goal itself.

## Per-Type Structure

Every coverage type in this skill is documented in the same six sub-fields, in this order:

1. **Definition** — what it measures.
2. **What it does NOT measure** — its limits / blind spots.
3. **Typical tools** — per ecosystem.
4. **When to use vs skip** — applicability heuristics.
5. **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls** — defensible numeric ranges (always with the risk caveat) and common gaming patterns.
6. **Cost-benefit ROI** — order-of-magnitude cost vs the signal you actually buy.

Scan any section by these headings.

## Structural / Code Coverage

Measured by instrumenting the compiled or interpreted program and recording which structural elements (lines, statements, branches, conditions, paths) the test suite executes.

### Line / Statement Coverage

- **Definition.** Percentage of source-code lines (or statements) executed at least once.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Whether branches were taken in both directions. Whether assertions verified the result. Whether boundary values were tested. Multiple statements on one line distort the metric ([Metridev](https://www.metridev.com/en/metrics/statement-vs-branch-coverage-understanding-the-difference/)).
- **Typical tools.**

  | Ecosystem | Tool |
  |-----------|------|
  | JS/TS | [Istanbul / nyc](https://istanbul.js.org/) (built into Jest, Vitest, Karma); `--coverage` flag |
  | Python | [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) + `pytest-cov`; supports branch mode |
  | JVM | [JaCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) — bytecode instrumentation, industry standard |
  | C/C++ | `gcov` / `lcov` / `gcovr`, [llvm-cov](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html) |
  | Go | `go test -cover`, `go tool cover` ([build-cover](https://go.dev/doc/build-cover) added integration-test mode in Go 1.20) |
  | .NET | [Coverlet](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet) (open-source default), [JetBrains dotCover](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/), AltCover. **OpenCover is in maintenance mode — prefer Coverlet / dotCover / AltCover** ([NDepend guide](https://blog.ndepend.com/guide-code-coverage-tools/)) |
  | Ruby | [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) |
  | Swift / Obj-C | Xcode built-in (llvm-cov backend) |
  | Rust | `cargo-llvm-cov`, `cargo-tarpaulin` |
  | Report formats | Cobertura XML, LCOV, Clover; aggregators: Codecov, Coveralls, SonarQube |

- **When to use vs skip.** Always-on; cost is near-zero (a CI flag). Never use as a quality goal in itself.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** 70–85% is typical for general-purpose code ([Qt blog](https://www.qt.io/quality-assurance/blog/is-70-80-90-or-100-code-coverage-good-enough)). Apply only with the risk caveat (see Risk-Based Interpretation below). Tests with no assertions still count lines as covered. Single-line `if (x) doA(); else doB();` shows 100% statement coverage with only one branch exercised. Snapshot-only tests inflate numbers without verifying behavior.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** Very high — cost near-zero, value is a tripwire on regression in test reach.

### Branch / Decision Coverage

- **Definition.** Percentage of decision branches (true/false outcomes of `if`, `while`, `for`, `?:`, `switch` cases) executed.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Compound-condition independence (`A && B` taken `true` might never test `A=true, B=false`). Order of evaluation. Loop iteration counts. Assertion strength.
- **Typical tools.** Same as line coverage; enable with `--branch` (coverage.py), branch mode (Istanbul is branch-aware by default), JaCoCo reports branches natively. Strictly stronger than line/statement coverage ([Graph AI](https://www.graphapp.ai/blog/statement-coverage-vs-branch-coverage-a-comprehensive-comparison)).
- **When to use vs skip.** Default for any non-trivial logic. Prefer branch over line as the primary structural metric.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** 70–80% branch is a "respectable" target for business apps ([Lead With Skills](https://www.leadwithskills.com/blogs/test-coverage-metrics-lines-branches-conditions-paths)) — always paired with the risk caveat. Compound conditions hide gaps: `if (A || B)` achieves 100% branch coverage with only one true-evaluating sub-condition and one false branch overall.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** High — best single structural metric for general-purpose code ([LinearB](https://linearb.io/blog/what-is-branch-coverage)).

### Condition Coverage

- **Definition.** Every Boolean **sub-condition** in every decision has taken both `true` and `false` at least once.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Whether each sub-condition independently affects the outcome (that is MC/DC). Does not require all combinations.
- **Typical tools.** Same toolchains as branch coverage; many report condition coverage as a separate column.

  | Ecosystem | Tool |
  |-----------|------|
  | JVM | JaCoCo (condition counters in branch reports) |
  | C / C++ | gcov/gcovr (`--branch-counts`), Qt Coco |
  | .NET | Coverlet (condition coverage via Cobertura output) |

- **When to use vs skip.** Informative for code with compound expressions; rarely useful as a CI gate on its own.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** Achievable without exercising every combination. `if (A && B)` hits 100% condition coverage with `{A=T,B=F}` and `{A=F,B=T}` — neither makes the decision `true`. Treat as a diagnostic, not a gate.
- **ROI:** Medium — useful diagnostically when investigating *why* branch coverage looks high but bugs persist; not a gate.

### MC/DC — Modified Condition/Decision Coverage

- **Definition** (per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage)):
  1. Every entry/exit point invoked at least once.
  2. Every decision has taken every outcome at least once.
  3. Every condition in a decision has taken every outcome at least once.
  4. Each condition has been shown to **independently** affect the decision's outcome (holding the other conditions fixed).

  For `n` conditions, MC/DC is achievable with `n+1` to `2n` tests via independence pairs — vastly cheaper than the `2^n` of exhaustive multiple-condition coverage ([LDRA](https://ldra.com/capabilities/mc-dc/)).

- **What it does NOT measure.** Loop iteration counts, data values, integration paths, assertion strength.
- **Typical tools.** LDRA TBvision, Rapita RapiCover, VectorCAST, Razorcat TESSY, [Qt Coco](https://www.qt.io/quality-assurance/coco/feature-modified-condition-decision-coverage-mcdc), Parasoft C/C++test. Mostly commercial — open-source MC/DC is rare.
- **When to use vs skip.** When mandated by a standard (DO-178C DAL A, ISO 26262 ASIL D, IEC 62304 Class C high-risk modules, EN 50128 SIL 4, IEC 61508 SIL 4). Outside regulated domains, branch coverage + mutation testing covers the same intent at lower cost.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** 100% by definition in regulated domains. Short-circuit evaluation in C-like languages can make some independence pairs unreachable; compiler optimizations can collapse conditions, so coverage builds must disable optimization — meaning the coverage-build binary is not the release-build binary, an acknowledged regulatory risk ([Verifysoft](https://www.verifysoft.com/en_ISO_26262_Road_Vehicles_Functional_Safety.html)).
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** Very high cost (specialist toolchain + labor + documentation overhead); high value only where required by law/standard.

### Function / Method Coverage

- **Definition.** Percentage of declared functions/methods invoked at least once.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Anything about the bodies of those functions.
- **Typical tools.** Reported by most structural-coverage tools as a side column.

  | Ecosystem | Tool |
  |-----------|------|
  | JVM | JaCoCo (method counter) |
  | .NET | Coverlet (methods column) |
  | Python | coverage.py (`report -m` granularity), pytest-cov |
  | JS/TS | Istanbul (functions metric in lcov / json-summary) |

- **When to use vs skip.** As a quick "did I forget a module?" check; never as a primary metric.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** Often deceptively high — many functions are entered by happy-path tests with no error-path coverage inside.
- **ROI:** Low — informational only; useful as a "module forgotten?" tripwire, not a gate.

### Path Coverage

- **Definition.** Percentage of unique linearly-independent paths through a function. Bounded by cyclomatic complexity `V(G) = decisions + 1` ([Cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity)).
- **What it does NOT measure.** Anything practical for non-trivial functions — `N` decisions yields `2^N` paths, unbounded for loops.
- **Typical tools.** Some commercial safety-critical tools report basis-path counts; rarely a CI artifact.

  | Ecosystem | Tool |
  |-----------|------|
  | Safety-critical C/C++ | LDRA TBvision, VectorCAST (basis-path metrics) |
  | Any / complexity proxy | lizard, radon, SonarQube (cyclomatic complexity as a *bound*, not a path metric) |

- **When to use vs skip.** Rarely as a coverage target. Cyclomatic complexity is more useful as a **complexity signal** that *bounds the minimum* number of tests needed to exercise distinct flows.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** Combinatorial explosion. Most production code is uncovered at path-coverage level and that is acceptable.
- **ROI:** Low for production code; meaningful only inside very small, very high-criticality functions — outside that, use complexity as a *signal* and stop.

## Mutation Testing as Coverage Analysis

> **Reminder:** Mutation testing is a coverage analysis of an existing test suite. It is **not** a test type. It produces a score and a list of survived mutants; it does not produce new tests. You apply it *to* your unit / integration suite, not *instead of* it.

### Definition

Mutation testing introduces small, syntactic modifications ("mutants") to the source and re-runs the existing test suite against each mutant. If at least one test **fails** for a given mutant, the mutant is **killed** (the suite detected the fault). If all tests **pass**, the mutant **survived** (the suite is blind to that change). It measures *test-suite fault-detection power*, not source-code reach ([Stryker docs](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/)).

Typical mutation operators:

- **Arithmetic** — `+` → `-`, `*` → `/`, `++` → `--`.
- **Conditional / relational** — `<` → `<=`, `==` → `!=`, `&&` → `||`.
- **Boolean / negation** — `true` → `false`, remove `!`.
- **Statement removal / block deletion.**
- **Return value** — `return x` → `return null` / `return ""`.
- **Increment / decrement of literal constants.**
- **Conditional boundary** — `>` → `>=`.

### Mutant states ([Stryker docs](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/mutation-testing-elements/mutant-states-and-metrics/))

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Killed** | At least one test failed on the mutant. Suite detected the fault. |
| **Survived** | All tests passed on the mutant. Suite is blind. |
| **No coverage** | No test executed the mutated code (orthogonal gap — code itself is untested). |
| **Timeout** | Tests hung; usually counted as a kill (the suite *did* observe abnormal behavior). |
| **Compile error / runtime error** | Mutant is syntactically/semantically invalid; usually filtered. |
| **Ignored** | Filtered by config (generated code, glue, etc.). |

Score: `mutation_score = killed_mutants / (total_mutants - equivalent_mutants - errors)`. Some tools also report a "killed%" relative to *covered* mutants only.

### What it does NOT measure

- **Dead-code regions** — appear as `no coverage`, identical to "line not covered."
- **Semantic correctness** of assertions — a wrong-but-strict assertion still kills mutants.
- **Boundary data values** — operator mutants approximate this but do not replace BVA.
- **Equivalent mutants** — variants that produce identical observable behavior. Detection is undecidable in general; manual review is the only certain method. Modern tools (Stryker TypeScript Checker, PIT with Major) reduce these heuristically. **Do not chase 100% mutation score** — equivalents make it asymptotically unattainable ([Stryker docs](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/mutation-testing-elements/equivalent-mutants/)).

### Typical tools

### When to use vs skip

**Apply when:**

- Suite is already structurally mature (typically >80% branch coverage). On a sparse suite, mutation results are dominated by `no coverage` and you learn nothing new beyond what structural coverage already shows.
- Artifact is **pure-logic core** — financial calculations, security-critical validation, parsers, encryption, authorization decisions.
- Criticality is high enough that suite blind spots represent material risk.

**Skip when:**

- Glue code, controllers, framework wiring — operators generate noise on declarative constructs.
- UI rendering — equivalents dominate.
- Configuration, DTOs, declarative serialization.
- Brand-new suite still being built up.
- Tight CI feedback loop where N×suite runtime is prohibitive (mitigate with incremental analysis, not by giving up coverage).

### Targets / thresholds & pitfalls

Stryker defaults ([config](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-js/configuration/)): `high: 80`, `low: 60`, `break: null`. Set `break` to fail the build below a floor. Apply with the risk caveat: 60–80% on a mature unit suite over pure-logic core is a reasonable starting point; never on glue code. Common pitfalls: chasing equivalents (asymptote), running on UI/config (noise), running on shallow suites (re-reports what coverage already shows).

### Cost-benefit ROI

- **Cost.** CPU-quadratic-ish. A 60-second suite generating 1,000 mutants is up to 1,000 × 60s without optimization. Modern tools mitigate via incremental analysis, per-mutant test selection, and parallel runners.
- **Benefit.** Catches *missing assertions* and *over-mocked* tests that structural coverage cannot detect. It is the **only practical coverage technique that scores assertion strength** — the chief failure mode of "100% coverage with no assertions" ([codeintelligently.com](https://codeintelligently.com/blog/ai-generated-tests-false-confidence)).
- **CI pattern.** Incremental mutation on PR diff; nightly full run on critical modules ([oneuptime](https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/2026-01-24-mutation-testing/view); see also research roundup at [greg4cr.github.io](https://greg4cr.github.io/pdf/23mutationci.pdf)).

### Relationship to structural coverage

Mutation testing **subsumes and supplements** structural coverage:

- A mutant in unreachable code is `no coverage` — identical signal to "line not covered."
- A mutant in covered code that survives — "covered but not meaningfully verified" — is invisible to structural coverage.

---

## Requirements / Feature Coverage

### Definition

Mapping between specification artifacts (requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, regulatory clauses) and verifying tests:

```
requirements_coverage = requirements_with_>=1_passing_test / total_requirements
```

The foundational artifact is the **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** — a two-dimensional table correlating requirements to test cases ([ISTQB Glossary](https://istqb-glossary.page/traceability-matrix/)). Enables:

- **Forward traceability** — does every requirement have a test?
- **Backward traceability** — does every test trace to a requirement?
- **Change impact analysis** — when requirement X changes, which tests must be revisited?

### What it does NOT measure

- Whether the test is **correct** — a passing test against the wrong assertion still ticks the RTM box.
- Whether the requirement itself is **complete** — RTM coverage of 100% means nothing if the requirement set is missing scenarios.
- Code reach — RTM is orthogonal to structural coverage.

### Typical tools

| Tool | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Jira + Xray / Zephyr / Test Manager | ALM | Stories ↔ tests linked in tickets |
| Polarion, IBM DOORS / DOORS Next, Codebeamer | Regulated-domain ALM | Tier 1 for DO-178C / ISO 26262 |
| Spreadsheet + tags in test names | Lightweight | Works for small teams; deteriorates at scale |
| BDD scenario reports | BDD-aligned | Cucumber + Pickles report generator |
| `@Tag("AC-123")` style annotations | Code-level | JUnit / pytest tag-based linking to AC IDs |

In BDD ecosystems, Gherkin `Scenario:` blocks are the unit of acceptance coverage; each AC ideally maps to one or more scenarios (the Cardinal Rule of BDD: one scenario, one behavior — [Automation Panda](https://automationpanda.com/bdd/)). Tools: [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) (multi-language), [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) (note: the active community fork is [Reqnroll](https://reqnroll.net/)), [behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/) (Python), [pytest-bdd](https://pytest-bdd.readthedocs.io/), [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/), Behat (PHP).

Foundational standards: **ISTQB Foundation Level** treats RTM as a foundational artifact for systematic test design. **[ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_29119)** parts 1–5 require traceability at the test-plan, test-design, and test-execution levels (ISTQB-to-29119 mapping in [rcolomo.com](https://www.rcolomo.com/papers/326.pdf)). Regulatory traceability is **mandatory** in DO-178C, ISO 26262 Part 6 work products, IEC 62304 verification record, and FDA 21 CFR Part 820.

### When to use vs skip

- **Use** for anything with explicit acceptance criteria, regulated software, contract deliverables. Cheap when test names embed AC IDs (`it("AC-3: rejects mismatched passwords")`).
- **Skip** for throwaway scripts and internal-only tooling without documented requirements.

### Targets / thresholds & pitfalls

100% requirements coverage is a reasonable goal — every documented AC should have at least one test. The pitfalls are *qualitative*, not numerical:

- **Ceremony tax** — heavy RTM tooling that demands manual updates dies of bitrot.
- **One-test-per-AC trap** — a single test does not "cover" an AC if the AC has multiple equivalence partitions or boundaries.
- **Aspirational requirements** — counting "tests planned" instead of "tests passing" produces fake green RTMs.
- **Silent invalidation** — requirements churn breaks traceability unless link integrity is enforced.

### Cost-benefit ROI

- **High** for regulated / contract work where it is mandatory.
- **Medium** for product teams using BDD with AC tags in test names — cost is near-zero, traceability is a CI artifact.
- **Low** for solo / prototype work.

---

## API / Integration Coverage

API coverage measures the integration surface — endpoints, methods, status codes, payload fields, and inter-service contracts — exercised by the test suite, independent of code coverage.

### Endpoint Coverage

- **Definition.** `(unique_endpoint_method_pairs_hit) / (total_documented_endpoint_method_pairs)`. Often broken down further by `(endpoint, method, status_code)` triples.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Whether responses are *correct* — only that endpoints were hit. The combinatorial inputs leading to each status code.
- **Typical tools.** [Schemathesis](https://schemathesis.readthedocs.io/) (OpenAPI/GraphQL-driven test generator that reports endpoint and status-code coverage), [Dredd](https://dredd.org/) (validates HTTP API against API Blueprint / OpenAPI), API gateway access logs (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway) ingested into coverage dashboards, custom middleware tracking `(method, path_template, status)` triples observed during test runs vs the OpenAPI spec.
- **When to use vs skip.** Use whenever an OpenAPI / GraphQL spec exists. Skip for internal libraries with no network surface.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** Path-template normalization (`/users/123` vs `/users/:id`) is a common defect in custom collectors. Undocumented endpoints showing 0% when they are the riskiest. `5xx` error paths are rarely tested.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** High — schemathesis-style generation is cheap and surfaces gaps fast.

### Contract Coverage (Consumer-Driven Contracts)

- **Definition.** Percentage of consumer-side **interactions** (request/response examples) that the provider has verified. Consumer generates Pact files (JSON contracts) capturing specific interactions; provider runs verification suites against those contracts in CI.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Provider behavior on inputs no consumer ever sends (negative space). Performance, security, or schema completeness.
- **Typical tools.** [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/) (multi-language), Pact Broker / [Pactflow](https://pactflow.io/what-is-consumer-driven-contract-testing/) for storage and verification reports. [Spring Cloud Contract](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-contract/) (Groovy/YAML/Java DSL contracts; auto-generates JUnit/Spock provider tests and WireMock stubs for consumers, supports CDC and producer-driven contracts).
- **When to use vs skip.** Use when there are multiple independent consumers with independent deploy cadences (microservices, mobile + web sharing a backend). Skip for single-consumer APIs that deploy with the provider, or for library APIs.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** "Schema valid" is weaker than "contract honored" — schema tells you what shapes are *legal*; contract tells you which fields and behaviors a consumer *actually depends on* ([Speakeasy: Pact vs OpenAPI](https://www.speakeasy.com/blog/pact-vs-openapi)).
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** High in multi-consumer architectures; over-investment in single-consumer setups.

### Schema Coverage (OpenAPI / JSON Schema / GraphQL)

- **Definition.** Percentage of schema fields, enum values, and `oneOf` / `anyOf` variants exercised across the test suite.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Semantic field correctness (a field can have the wrong value but the right shape).
- **Typical tools.** [Schemathesis](https://schemathesis.readthedocs.io/) (property-based test generation from OpenAPI; emits coverage metrics over schema elements), [Dredd](https://dredd.org/) with hooks for field-level instrumentation, [Specmatic](https://specmatic.io/) (schema-first, supports consumer-driven and provider-driven contracts), [Pactflow Bi-Directional Contract Testing](https://pactflow.io/blog/contract-testing-using-json-schemas-and-open-api-part-3/) (Pact + OpenAPI for governance + interaction safety).
- **When to use vs skip.** Use whenever the API is schema-described. Skip when schemas are untrusted or out of date — fix the schema first.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** Optional fields are easy to ignore; nullability and `oneOf` variants are common blind spots; deprecated fields linger uncovered.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** Medium — most informative when paired with property-based generation.

### Integration-Path Coverage

- **Definition.** Which service-to-service or component-to-component edges have been exercised end-to-end.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Code coverage inside each service; behavior under partial-failure conditions.
- **Typical tools.** Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Tempo, Lightstep) tagged with a `test_suite_id` to attribute spans to test runs; service-mesh telemetry (Istio, Linkerd).
- **When to use vs skip.** Use in mature microservice architectures with tracing already in place, especially against pre-prod / staging environments. Skip when tracing infrastructure does not exist (the cost of adding it is not justified by the coverage signal alone).
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** Stale traces from old runs masking current gaps; sampling rates that drop low-frequency paths; `test_suite_id` tags missing on out-of-band background work.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** Medium — high signal in mature platforms, prohibitive setup cost in greenfield.

## Additional Coverage Types

### Data / Equivalence-Class Coverage

- **Definition.** Coverage measured against **input partitions** rather than code. Each Equivalence Partition (EP) and Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) slot from ISTQB Foundation Level black-box techniques becomes a coverage element ([ISTQB BVA white paper](https://istqb.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Boundary-Value-Analysis-white-paper.pdf)). Example: a function over `orderTotal` with partitions `{<0, 0-99, 100-499, ≥500}` has 4 EP slots plus `(B-1, B, B+1)` boundary triples at 0, 100, 500 (9 boundary slots).
- **What it does NOT measure.** Code reach; multi-parameter interactions.
- **Typical tools.** Tracked as a checklist in the test plan, not by a tool. Some ALM tools support partition tagging.
- **When to use vs skip.** High value for parser / validator / calculator-style code. Skip for trivial pass-through code.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** Aim for every EP and every `(B-1, B, B+1)` triple. Pitfall: counting one BVA test as "covering" a partition.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** High for pure-logic code with bounded inputs.

### Pairwise / Combinatorial Coverage

- **Definition.** **Pairwise (all-pairs)** testing requires that every pair of parameter values appears in at least one test case. Most multi-parameter defects manifest at the 2-way interaction level ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pairs_testing)). **t-way coverage** generalizes to triples, quadruples, etc.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Three-way+ interactions (unless escalated to `t=3`); ordering effects in workflows.
- **Typical tools.** [Microsoft PICT](https://github.com/microsoft/pict) (Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Tool; supports constraints, weighting, seeding), AllPairs (Satisfice), [NIST ACTS](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/automated-combinatorial-testing-for-software) (supports `t` up to 6), CATS, Jenny, Hexawise.
- **When to use vs skip.** Use for 4+ parameters with finite domains (config matrices, feature flags, browser × OS × locale). Skip when parameter count is 2–3 (enumerate explicitly).
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** "100% pairwise" is achievable and a legitimate goal. Watch for constraint specification errors that silently exclude legal combinations.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** Very high once you have 4+ parameters — exhaustive blows up combinatorially; pairwise stays near-linear.

### Exception / Error-Path Coverage

- **Definition.** Percentage of `catch` blocks, `Result.Err` branches, `if (err != nil)` branches, and explicit error return paths exercised.
- **What it does NOT measure.** Whether the error was handled *correctly* (logged? user-facing message? retried? compensating transaction?).
- **Typical tools.** Branch coverage on error-handling branches specifically — tools rarely report this as a separate metric, but coverage reports typically highlight uncovered `catch` blocks.
- **When to use vs skip.** Always inspect uncovered `catch` blocks in coverage reports; they are usually the suite's largest blind spot.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** Mocking error injection in unit tests is awkward; error paths are often dead-code-eliminated in optimized coverage builds and become invisible.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** High — error paths are where production incidents originate; small audit effort, large risk reduction.

### State / Transition Coverage

- **Definition.** Percentage of declared transitions (and optionally forbidden transitions) in a state machine exercised by tests.
- **Switch-level coverage:** *0-switch* — every transition exercised once. *1-switch* — every pair of consecutive transitions. *2-switch* — every triple. *Round-trip* — every cycle in the state graph ([Lead With Skills](https://www.leadwithskills.com/blogs/state-transition-testing-behavior-based-systems-istqb)).
- **What it does NOT measure.** Data carried across transitions; non-modeled behavior.
- **Typical tools.** Model-based testing tools — GraphWalker, ModelJUnit, fMBT. State diagrams in PlantUML / Mermaid used as input.
- **When to use vs skip.** Use for workflow engines, order / payment lifecycles, UI step-wizards, protocol implementations, regulated approval flows. Skip for stateless services.
- **Targets / thresholds & pitfalls.** 0-switch is a defensible minimum for critical workflows; 1-switch on critical paths catches "did A→B work after C→A?" bugs. Forbidden-transition tests are easy to forget.
- **Cost-benefit ROI.** High for workflow software; negligible elsewhere.

## Cross-Cutting Topics

### Combining methods — what each one cannot show

Different coverage axes detect different bug classes. Combining them is multiplicative, not additive.

**Worked example — input validator for a discount code.** Consider `if (code.length > 0 && code.startsWith("PROMO"))`. A single happy-path test with `"PROMO10"` produces:

| Axis added | What it newly catches | What still hides |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Line only | Everything executes once — 100% line. | Both empty-string and non-`PROMO` rejection paths are untested; a refactor to `>= 0` ships green. |
| + Branch | Forces a false-branch test, e.g. `""`. Now the empty-string case is exercised. | A weak assertion (`expect(result).toBeDefined()`) still kills no bugs; mutating `>` → `>=` leaves the suite green because no test asserts the specific rejection. |
| + Mutation | Killing the `>` → `>=` and `startsWith` → `endsWith` mutants forces tests with *specific* assertions on the rejection outcome. | A boundary value like `code.length === MAX` is still untested — that requires **Boundary / data coverage**. |
| + Data (BVA) | Adds the `MAX`, `MAX+1`, and `null` cases. | A second consumer that calls this validator with `code = undefined` is still uncaught — that requires **Contract coverage**. |

Each new axis closes a class of fault the previous axes structurally **cannot** see — branch alone can never detect weak assertions, mutation alone can never detect untested boundary values, and contract coverage alone can never detect logic bugs. That is the multiplicative effect. The table below lists each axis and the blind spots it has — read it as "to fill this blind spot, layer another axis."

| Axis | Blind to |
|------|----------|
| Statement / line | Untaken branches, missing assertions, wrong return values |
| Branch / decision | Compound-condition independence, loop iteration counts, assertion strength |
| MC/DC | Data-value boundaries (still need BVA), assertion strength |
| Path | Combinatorial explosion at runtime; impractical beyond toy functions |
| Mutation | Dead-code regions (no coverage); semantic correctness of assertions (a wrong-but-strict assertion still kills mutants) |
| RTM / requirements | Whether the requirement is complete; whether the test is correct |
| Endpoint / API | Field-level shape correctness; behavioral correctness |
| Contract | Negative space — provider features no consumer uses |
| Schema | Semantic correctness; field meaning |
| Pairwise | 3-way+ interactions; ordering effects |
| State-transition | Data carried across transitions; non-modeled behavior |
| Error-path | Whether the error was handled correctly |

A typical layered stack for non-regulated product code:

1. **Branch coverage** — CI gate and regression tripwire.
2. **Requirements / AC linkage** — every acceptance criterion has at least one test.
3. **Mutation testing** — nightly on pure-logic core modules only.
4. **Pairwise** — on multi-parameter config / feature surfaces.
5. **Contract / endpoint coverage** — for public APIs.
6. **State-transition coverage** — for workflows.

This stack costs marginal CI minutes and surfaces the majority of test-suite blind spots that matter in practice.

### The weak-assertion pitfall

The single most common reason high coverage fails to reflect quality:

```ts
// 100% statement coverage. 0% useful.
it("computes discount", () => {
  discount(150);            // line executed
  // no assertion
});
```

Or, more subtly:

```ts
// 100% statement coverage. Verifies nothing semantic.
it("renders form", () => {
  expect(render(<Form />)).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

Both tests execute every line they touch and produce green coverage reports. Both are detected by mutation testing: every operator mutation in `discount` survives because no assertion can fail; every change in `<Form />` survives because the snapshot can be updated with `--update-snapshot`. **Coverage alone cannot distinguish these from a strong suite.** Mutation testing can.

Counter-measure: when a coverage report shows ≥80% with persistent bugs in production, run mutation analysis on the suspect modules before raising the coverage target.

### Risk-based interpretation

Coverage targets should be **proportional to risk** ([ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_29119)). The same artifact at different criticalities should not have the same coverage gate. Use the table below as a starting point — adjust per artifact, not per team policy.

| Criticality | Reasonable structural target | Mutation? | RTM? | MC/DC? |
|-------------|------------------------------|-----------|------|--------|
| NONE (docs, throwaway) | — | No | No | No |
| LOW (internal tooling) | 60% line | No | Lightweight | No |
| MEDIUM (CRUD / standard product) | 70–80% branch | On core logic only | Per AC | No |
| MEDIUM-HIGH (user-facing critical path) | 80% branch | On core logic + key validators | Mandatory | No |
| HIGH (money, auth, security) | 90%+ branch | Required on pure-logic core | Mandatory + audit-grade | Where standard mandates |
| Regulated | Per standard | Recommended on pure-logic core | Mandatory + audit-grade | Required where standard mandates |

**Delta thresholds** ("must not drop more than X%") are generally safer than absolute floors — they protect against regression in testing discipline without rewarding gaming ([Optivem](https://journal.optivem.com/p/code-coverage-targets-recipe-for-disaster)). The exception is greenfield code, where there is no baseline to delta against.

### Common gaming patterns to recognize

1. **Assertion-free tests** — execute code without verifying behavior. Mutation testing reveals these.
2. **Snapshot-only tests** inflating numbers — `expect(component).toMatchSnapshot()` covers every line but verifies nothing semantic; one careless `--update-snapshot` invalidates the suite. Counter: cap snapshot contribution, or require an accompanying behavior assertion.
3. **Coverage of dead code** — code unreachable in production but exercised by tests via reflection / test-only entry points. Static analyzers (SonarQube, Coverity) flag dead code; CI should fail when dead code increases.
4. **Try/catch wrappers** to suppress failures while still executing lines.
5. **One-line condensation** to drop branch counts (`a && b && doX()` instead of `if (a && b) doX();`) — tooling-dependent gaming.
6. **Excluding files from coverage** without a recorded reason. Counter: require a `// coverage:ignore` comment with a rationale that survives code review.
7. **Coverage on generated code** inflating the denominator. Counter: exclude `*.generated.*` deterministically.
8. **Counting tests planned but not passing** in the RTM.
9. **Tagging multiple ACs with one trivial test** to make the RTM look green.
10. **Stale traces** — old Playwright / OpenTelemetry traces masking current gaps.

### Instrumentation caveats

- Coverage builds typically disable optimization, so `coverage_build_behavior ≠ release_build_behavior`. Especially relevant for C/C++/Rust and MC/DC — the coverage-build binary is not the release-build binary.
- Concurrent test execution with sampling-based coverage can lose data; prefer atomic modes (Go `-covermode=atomic`, JaCoCo offline instrumentation).
- Coverage of native code called from managed runtimes (JNI, FFI) is usually missed unless explicitly tooled.
- Hot-reload / watch-mode environments accumulate stale coverage data; always clean before measurement.

### Regulated-domain coverage standards

| Standard | Domain | Coverage requirement |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **[DO-178C](https://www.consunova.com/do178c-info.html)** §6.4.4.2, Table A-7 | Avionics | MC/DC required for DAL A; Decision coverage for DAL B; Statement coverage for DAL C; none for DAL D/E ([LDRA structural coverage](https://ldra.com/ldra-blog/do-178c-structural-coverage-analysis/)) |
| **[ISO 26262](https://www.parasoft.com/learning-center/iso-26262/code-coverage/)** Part 6 Table 9 | Automotive | MC/DC highly recommended for ASIL D; branch for ASIL B–C; statement minimum for ASIL A ([Verifysoft](https://www.verifysoft.com/en_ISO_26262_Road_Vehicles_Functional_Safety.html)) |
| **[IEC 62304](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/iec-62304-medical-device-software-guide)** | Medical | Coverage scales with safety class A → B → C; auditors expect MC/DC for Class C high-risk modules; MISRA C/C++ coding standards customary alongside |
| **[MISRA C / MISRA C++](https://www.misra.org.uk/)** | Embedded (cross-industry) | Coding-rule conformance is the primary signal; coverage is complementary; MC/DC expected for safety-critical components |
| **EN 50128 / EN 50657** | Rail | MC/DC required for SIL 4 |
| **IEC 61508** | Functional-safety umbrella | MC/DC for SIL 4 |

In regulated domains, the coverage **target is set by the standard**, not negotiated against ROI. The choice is which standard applies, not what threshold to pick.

## Decision Reference Tables

These are **lookup tables**, not steps. Read the row that matches your artifact and criticality; ignore the rest.

### Coverage methods by criticality

| Criticality | Recommended coverage signals |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| NONE | None — explicit skip |
| LOW | Line coverage as tripwire; AC linkage if the work has ACs |
| MEDIUM | Branch coverage + AC linkage; endpoint coverage if API artifact |
| MEDIUM-HIGH | Branch coverage + AC linkage + endpoint / contract coverage; mutation on validators |
| HIGH | Branch coverage + mutation on pure logic + AC linkage + state-transition coverage for workflows + pairwise for config; MC/DC where standard mandates |
| Regulated (DO-178C / ISO 26262 / IEC 62304) | Whatever the standard prescribes — usually MC/DC + RTM + auditable evidence |

### Coverage methods by artifact type

| Artifact | Most informative coverage axes |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Pure utility function (parser, calculator, formatter) | Branch + BVA/EP + mutation |
| HTTP endpoint with DB / queue | Branch (unit) + endpoint + contract + status-code |
| UI component | Storybook story coverage + interaction coverage + visual regression baseline; logic helpers via branch + mutation |
| Workflow engine / state machine | State-transition (0-switch minimum, 1-switch on critical paths) + branch |
| Authorization / policy module | Branch + MC/DC if regulated, otherwise branch + mutation; decision-table coverage at design time |
| Multi-parameter config / feature flag | Pairwise (PICT / ACTS) + branch |
| Public API consumed by N clients | Contract (Pact) + endpoint + schema |
| Library / SDK | Branch + property-based; mutation on pure logic; published-API surface coverage |
| Generated code | Excluded from structural coverage; verify via integration only |

### UI / interaction coverage extras

For UI-heavy projects, these specialized coverage signals supplement (do not replace) structural and mutation analysis:

- **Playwright trace coverage** — Playwright records traces (DOM, network, console) per test; the [trace viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) makes UI coverage **auditable** in a way DOM-snapshot tests cannot. Trace artifacts grow CI storage.
- **Storybook coverage** — [Storybook Test](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests) reports which stories (component states) have an interaction test (`play` function) vs only a rendered snapshot.
- **Visual coverage** — pixel-diff regressions across stories ([Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/), Percy, Applitools, Playwright `toHaveScreenshot`). Coverage element = component-state visual baseline.

These do **not** measure logic correctness (use branch + mutation for that), cross-component flows (use e2e), accessibility (use axe-core / Pa11y), or real-device variations (use BrowserStack / Sauce / device farms).
