Use when the user wants to upload or organize knowledge files, build a knowledge library, or sync an external knowledge source. To attach these to an agent, use the cargo-ai skill.

# Cargo CLI — Content

Workspace **knowledge** management: upload and organize **files** (PDFs, CSVs, text) and group or sync them into **libraries**. These are the binary/grouped knowledge resources that ground agent responses (retrieval-augmented generation, RAG).

> **New top-level domain (CLI ≥ 1.0.19).** Files and libraries moved out of the `ai` domain into the `content` domain — `cargo-ai content file …` and `cargo-ai content library …`. The old `cargo-ai ai file …` commands no longer exist; an `unknown command` error means you're on the old path.

> For **attaching** a file or library to an agent (via the release `resources` array), use [`cargo-ai`](../cargo-ai/SKILL.md).
> For **folders** that organize files, use [`cargo-workspace-management`](../cargo-workspace-management/SKILL.md) (`cargo-ai workspaceManagement folder …`).
> For batch-run **input** files (CSVs uploaded to drive a batch), that's a different surface — `cargo-ai workspaceManagement file upload` — documented in [`cargo-workspace-management`](../cargo-workspace-management/SKILL.md).

> See `references/examples/files.md` for end-to-end file, library, and attach-to-agent examples.
> See `references/response-shapes.md` for full JSON response structures.
> See `references/troubleshooting.md` for common errors and how to fix them.

## Prerequisites

See [`../cargo/references/prerequisites.md`](../cargo/references/prerequisites.md) for install, login (`--oauth` / `--token`), JSON output conventions, and error shapes. Verify the session with `cargo-ai whoami` before running any of the commands below.

## Discover resources first

```bash
cargo-ai content file list                 # all uploaded files (uuid, name, contentType, size)
cargo-ai content library list              # knowledge libraries (native or connector-backed)
```

## Files

Upload files (PDFs, CSVs, text) so an agent can ground its responses in specific knowledge. The upload response includes the `uuid` you reference when attaching the file to an agent release (see [`cargo-ai`](../cargo-ai/SKILL.md)).

```bash
# List all files
cargo-ai content file list

# Get a single file
cargo-ai content file get <file-uuid>

# Upload a file (optionally straight into a folder)
cargo-ai content file upload --file-path ./knowledge-base.pdf
cargo-ai content file upload --file-path ./knowledge-base.pdf --folder-uuid <folder-uuid>

# Update a file's name or folder
cargo-ai content file update --uuid <file-uuid> --name "Q1 Research Notes"
cargo-ai content file update --uuid <file-uuid> --folder-uuid <folder-uuid>

# Remove a file
cargo-ai content file remove <file-uuid>
```

> **Reading content files from the context sandbox.** Uploaded content files are also available **read-only** under `.files/` in the context runtime sandbox, so a command run there can consume them — e.g. `cargo-ai context runtime execute --command ls --args '["-1",".files"]'`. The directory sits outside the committed context tree (never pushed, not writable); to add or change files use `content file` here. See [`cargo-context`](../cargo-context/SKILL.md).

## Libraries

A library groups files into one resource an agent can reference. There are two kinds:

- **`native`** — workspace-managed collections of uploaded files.
- **`connector`** — synced from an external source (e.g. a help center or knowledge base) through an unstructured-data extractor (`--extractor-slug`). Get the `connectorUuid` from [`cargo-connection`](../cargo-connection/SKILL.md).

```bash
# List libraries (filter by kind or connector)
cargo-ai content library list
cargo-ai content library list --kind native
cargo-ai content library list --kind connector --connector-uuid <connector-uuid>

# Get a single library
cargo-ai content library get <library-uuid>

# Create a connector-backed library
cargo-ai content library create \
  --name "Help Center" \
  --connector-uuid <connector-uuid> \
  --extractor-slug <extractor-slug> \
  --folder-uuid <folder-uuid> \
  --config '{}'

# Update / remove
cargo-ai content library update --uuid <library-uuid> --name "Updated Name"
cargo-ai content library remove <library-uuid>
```

## Attaching to an agent

Files and libraries are knowledge **resources** — they do nothing until attached to an agent via that agent's draft release `resources` array, then deployed. That wiring lives in [`cargo-ai`](../cargo-ai/SKILL.md) (`ai release update-draft --resources …` → `ai release deploy-draft`). See `references/examples/files.md` for the upload → attach → deploy sequence.

## Help

Every command supports `--help`:

```bash
cargo-ai content file upload --help
cargo-ai content library create --help
```
