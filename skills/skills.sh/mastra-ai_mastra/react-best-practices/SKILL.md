# React Best Practices

## Overview

Routing and priority guide for React performance and quality, containing 19 rules across 8 categories. Rule files hold the detailed explanations, examples, review smells, and impact metrics.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing new React components
- Implementing data fetching
- Reviewing code for performance issues
- Refactoring existing React code
- Optimizing bundle size or load times

## Priority-Ordered Guidelines

Rules are prioritized by impact:

| Priority | Category                  | Impact                        |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1        | Eliminating Waterfalls    | CRITICAL                      |
| 2        | Bundle Size Optimization  | CRITICAL                      |
| 3        | Client-Side Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH                   |
| 4        | Re-render Optimization    | MEDIUM                        |
| 5        | Rendering Performance     | MEDIUM                        |
| 6        | JavaScript Performance    | LOW-MEDIUM                    |
| 7        | Component Structure       | MEDIUM-HIGH (maintainability) |
| 8        | Testing                   | MEDIUM-HIGH (correctness)     |

## Quick Reference

### Critical Patterns (Apply First)

**Eliminate Waterfalls:**

- Use `Promise.all()` for independent async operations (`async-parallel`)

**Reduce Bundle Size:**

- Avoid barrel file imports, import directly from source (`bundle-barrel-imports`)
- Defer non-critical third-party libraries (`bundle-defer-third-party`)

### Medium-Impact Patterns

**Client-Side Data Fetching:**

- Use Tanstack Query for automatic request deduplication (`client-request-dedupe`)
- Dependent query params are the value or `undefined`, never `| null` or a fake fallback; narrow at the caller so hooks stay strict, or guard with `skipToken` when the hook must accept an optional param (`client-request-dedupe`)

**Re-render Optimization:**

- Use lazy state initialization for expensive values (`rerender-lazy-state-init`)
- Apply `startTransition` for non-urgent updates (`rerender-transitions`)
- Minimize `useEffect` function calls (`rerender-useeffect-function-calls`)
- Never reset state with `useEffect`; lift the discriminant and remount the branch (`rerender-no-useeffect-state-reset`)

**Component Structure:**

- One domain component/hook per file, one responsibility each — split bloated components (`structure-single-responsibility`)
- Use PascalCase components for JSX-returning helpers; keep lowercase helpers for non-JSX values (`structure-component-naming`)
- Derive props/params instead of accepting a value computable from another arg (`structure-derive-dont-duplicate`)
- Pick the view with early `if` guards but keep the layout wrapper in one place — branch a body component, don't ternary or duplicate the shell (`structure-early-return-render-branches`)
- For a fixed set of items, write one component per item with explicit props that owns its data and loading — don't map a config-object array onto a component shape (`structure-composition-over-config`)

**Testing:**

- BDD tests that drive the real `@mastra/client-js` + React Query stack and mock only the network; never `vi.mock` our own hooks/services/auth gating or the SDK (`testing-bdd-no-mocks`)

### Rendering Patterns

- Animate SVG wrappers, not SVG elements directly (`rendering-animate-svg-wrapper`)
- Use `content-visibility: auto` for long lists (`rendering-content-visibility`)

### JavaScript Patterns

- Use Set/Map for repeated lookups (`js-set-map-lookups`)
- Use `toSorted()` instead of `sort()` for immutability (`js-tosorted-immutable`)
- Early length check for array comparisons (`js-length-check-first`)

## References

Rule files are the canonical source for detailed guidance and examples:

- `references/react-best-practices-reference.md` - Rule catalog with category order and rule-file paths
- `references/rules/` - Canonical individual rule files organized by category

Load only the relevant rule file when implementing or reviewing a specific pattern. Use the catalog to choose the right rule without loading every example.

To look up a specific pattern, grep the rules directory:

```
grep -l "Promise.all" references/rules/
grep -l "barrel" references/rules/
grep -l "Tanstack" references/rules/
```
