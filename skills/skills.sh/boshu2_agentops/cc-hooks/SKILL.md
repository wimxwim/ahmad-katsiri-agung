# Claude Code Hooks

## Absorbed skills (ag-s43tg)

- **cc-cron-ticks** — Scheduling autonomous in-session flywheel ticks with Claude Code cron routines.
- **cc-loop-driver** — Running a Claude-native control-plane tick loop with worker and separate-validator subagents.
- **cc-subagents** — Dispatching scoped Claude Code subagents with worktrees, roles, tools, memory, and evidence gates.
- **cc-worktree-isolation** — Isolating parallel Claude Code workers in separate git worktrees to prevent file collisions.

Shell commands that fire at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle.

<!-- TOC: Quick Start | Events | Blocking | Writing Hooks | Anti-Patterns | References -->

## Quick Start

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` (user) or `.claude/settings.json` (project):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "my-validator.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Hook Events

| Event | When | Blocks? | Common Use |
|-------|------|---------|------------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before tool runs | Yes | Block/modify commands |
| `PostToolUse` | After tool succeeds | Feedback | Auto-format, lint |
| `PermissionRequest` | Permission dialog | Yes | Auto-approve/deny |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Prompt submitted | Yes | Add context, validate |
| `Stop` | Claude finishes | Yes | Force continue |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins | No | Load context, set env |
| `Notification` | Notifications | No | Desktop alerts |

Full schemas: [HOOK-EVENTS.md](references/HOOK-EVENTS.md)

## Matchers

```
"Bash"              → exact match
"Edit|Write"        → regex OR
"mcp__.*__write"    → MCP tools
"*" or ""           → all tools
```

Tools: `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`

## Exit Codes

| Code | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 0 | Success - JSON parsed from stdout |
| 2 | **Block** - stderr fed to Claude |
| Other | Non-blocking error |

## Blocking a Tool

**Simple (exit 2):**
```bash
echo "Blocked: reason" >&2 && exit 2
```

**JSON (exit 0):**
```json
{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"Blocked"}}
```

Decisions: `"allow"` (auto-approve), `"deny"` (block), `"ask"` (show dialog)

## Modifying Input

```json
{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"allow",
  "updatedInput":{"command":"modified-command"}}}
```

## Real-World: DCG + RCH

```json
{"hooks":{"PreToolUse":[{"matcher":"Bash","hooks":[
  {"type":"command","command":"dcg"},
  {"type":"command","command":"rch"}
]}]}}
```

- **DCG**: Blocks `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, `git push --force`
- **RCH**: Routes builds to remote workers

## Skill-First Coordination Guard (opt-in)

A copy-paste PreToolUse recipe that nudges agents to **load the coordination
skill before hand-rolling the `am`/`atm`/`ntm`/`tmux send-keys` CLI**. AgentOps
3.0 is hookless — this auto-installs nothing; you opt in per host.

**Context-budget doctrine for hooks:** hooks are the most powerful enforcement
(mechanical, can't be reasoned past) but they pollute context — use sparingly. A
hook must be SILENT on the happy path (exit 0, no stdout/stderr), fire ONLY on a
real violation (ideally once per session, sentinel-gated), prefer PreToolUse
violation-guards over `UserPromptSubmit`/`SessionStart` per-turn injectors, and
NEVER emit stray stdout on an exit-0 PreToolUse path (it is parsed as JSON and
breaks the tool call). Block via exit 2 + stderr.

The recipe ships both scripts verbatim, a precise head-only matcher (so a
`br create --body "...am/atm/ntm..."` never false-fires), the two-matcher
opt-in `settings.json` snippet, and a bats test proving every fire/silent case.

Recipe: [SKILL-FIRST-COORDINATION-GUARD.md](references/SKILL-FIRST-COORDINATION-GUARD.md)

## Installed-Skill-Edit Guard (opt-in)

A PreToolUse `Edit|Write` guard that routes an edit of an **installed skill copy**
(`*/.claude/skills/**`, `.codex`, `.gemini`) back to the repo source of truth
`skills/<name>/`. This is a TRUE mistake-token — editing an installed/symlinked
copy has no legitimate form (overwritten on install, or symlinks through to the
factory checkout). Zero false-positive surface: it matches `tool_input.file_path`
only, so a doc that merely mentions `claude/skills` in its body never fires.
Reversible → it ROUTES (exit 2 + one-line redirect), not hard-blocks. Silent on
every other path; fires once per session. Ships INERT — opt-in installer:

```bash
scripts/install-installed-skill-edit-guard.sh   # user scope; --project for project
```

Recipe: [INSTALLED-SKILL-EDIT-GUARD.md](references/INSTALLED-SKILL-EDIT-GUARD.md)

### Value-proof (why this guard survives the hookless teardown)

The keystone guard ships **gate-blind per-fire telemetry**: on each fire it
appends exactly one JSONL line — `{ts, session, token_class, path_sha256}` — to
`${AGENTOPS_HOME:-~/.agentops}/guardrail-telemetry.jsonl` (override with
`AGENTOPS_GUARDRAIL_TELEMETRY`). The path is **SHA-256 hashed, never raw**
(privacy); nothing is written on the happy path; the sensor is inert until the
guard is installed and fires. The pre-registered methodology — metric =
declining fire-ATTEMPT rate over time (a signal the redirect cannot fake, NOT the
circular hand-roll rate), minimum N, noise floor, and **null-at-small-N is an
acceptable outcome** — satisfies ADR-0002 l.58 ("test or eval evidence showing
positive value"), the criterion whose absence killed 2.x hooks (#511).

Methodology: [GUARDRAIL-VALUE-PROOF.md](references/GUARDRAIL-VALUE-PROOF.md)

## Writing Your Own Hook

**Minimal Python:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json, sys

data = json.load(sys.stdin)
cmd = data.get('tool_input', {}).get('command', '')

if 'dangerous' in cmd:
    print("Blocked: dangerous", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(2)

sys.exit(0)  # Allow
```

**Hook input (stdin):**
```json
{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"npm test"},"session_id":"...","cwd":"..."}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Scope | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | All | Project root |
| `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` | SessionStart/Setup | Persist env vars |

## Stop Hook (Force Continue)

```json
{"decision":"block","reason":"Tests failing. Fix before stopping."}
```

**Critical:** Check `stop_hook_active` to prevent infinite loops.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Old object format | Array format with `matcher` |
| Unquoted `$VAR` | `"$VAR"` |
| Exit 2 with JSON | Exit 2 uses stderr only |
| Skip `stop_hook_active` check | Always check in Stop hooks |

## Debugging

```bash
claude --debug  # Hook execution details
/hooks          # View/edit in REPL
```

## Absorbed Skills (skill-prune phase 2 fold-ins)

This skill is the fold target for four retired Claude Code operator skills. Their
use-cases route here:

- **cc-cron-ticks** — scheduling autonomous in-session flywheel ticks with Claude
  Code cron routines. Use Claude Code scheduled tasks (cron routines) to fire a
  recurring tick prompt (e.g. an evolve tick or a bead-queue pull); pair each
  tick with a Stop hook that verifies evidence landed before the session ends.
- **cc-loop-driver** — running a Claude-native control-plane tick loop with worker
  and separate-validator subagents. One tick = claim a bead, dispatch a worker
  subagent, then a SEPARATE validator subagent grades the evidence; hooks enforce
  the gate (PreToolUse blocks out-of-scope writes, Stop blocks close-without-evidence).
- **cc-subagents** — dispatching scoped Claude Code subagents with worktrees, roles,
  tools, memory, and evidence gates. Give each subagent an explicit role prompt, a
  tool allowlist, and a write scope; never let two subagents share a write surface.
- **cc-worktree-isolation** — isolating parallel Claude Code workers in
  separate git worktrees to prevent file collisions.
  `git worktree add <dir> -b <branch>` per
  worker; workers commit only in their own worktree; the orchestrator merges
  branches sequentially. File collisions are the #1 swarm failure mode.
