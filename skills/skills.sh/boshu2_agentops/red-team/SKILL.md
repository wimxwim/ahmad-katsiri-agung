# red-team — moved to Mount Olympus (2026-06-10)

This skill encodes independent-verdict machinery and now lives with the outer
gate product. Canonical: `~/dev/mt-olympus/.claude/skills/red-team/SKILL.md` —
read and follow that file. This stub preserves fleet routing until the
using-agentops catalog closer updates the registry (skill-prune Lane A,
evidence/skill-prune-recon.md).
