> **Scope:** this skill is AgentOps **operating doctrine** for NTM. The binary is self-describing — for command syntax, flags, schemas, and examples use `ntm --robot-docs=quickstart|commands|examples|exit-codes`, `ntm --robot-capabilities`, `ntm --robot-schema=all`, or `ntm --help`. Never trust this file (or any notes) over the live contract. For tending loops, marching orders, unstick ladders, and swarm cadence, use the companion `using-atm` skill (the former `vibing-with-ntm` tending doctrine is folded into `/ntm`).

> **`atm` is the same binary.** `atm` (Bo's fork/alias, `~/.local/bin/atm`) is byte-identical to `ntm` — same `--help`, same `--robot-*` surface, same flags, same exit codes. Every `ntm …` form documented here and in the references applies verbatim to `atm …`, and vice-versa. Use them interchangeably; the companion out-of-session substrate skill is literally named `using-atm`. When `--robot-capabilities` matters, query whichever binary you invoked — they resolve to the same contract.

# NTM — Named Tmux Manager

> **The One Rule:** Discover the live NTM contract first, then use the least interactive surface that can prove and execute the action. No `--robot-capabilities` / `--robot-snapshot` evidence -> no automation assumption.

The most common NTM mistake is treating it like a tmux macro runner. NTM is a control plane: robot API, attention feed, work graph, locks/mail, pipelines, safety, approvals, serve API, and durability all have explicit contracts. Use the contract.

## Outcome — When an NTM Action Has Delivered

A state-changing NTM action is complete only when **all** of the following hold:

- The intended state transition is **visible in `ntm --robot-snapshot`** — not just acknowledged by the command's exit code. (NTM commands can succeed at the API layer while panes/work/locks remain unchanged; trust the snapshot, not the return value.)
- The **attention feed** (`--robot-attention` / `--robot-tail`) shows the expected event(s) — pane output, work-graph movement, lock acquire/release, mail delivery. Absence is evidence of failure.
- Adjacent state (git, br/beads, mail, pipelines) reflects the action's downstream effects within one observation window — otherwise the action fired in isolation and likely didn't accomplish its real purpose.
- Locks and pipelines you opened are either **released / completed** by you, or explicitly handed off via mail with a thread the next operator can claim. Orphaned locks block the swarm.
- For dispatched marching orders: the targeted pane has acknowledged (printed the order, started the work, or replied via mail). A sent-but-not-acknowledged order is not "done."

If the snapshot or attention feed disagrees with what the command said happened, **trust the snapshot** and re-discover the contract — the local model of NTM is stale.

## Cold Start: Which NTM Skill?

| Situation | Start here |
|---|---|
| You need NTM doctrine, then exact syntax via `--robot-docs` / references | This skill |
| You are tending an already-running swarm and deciding whether to nudge, restart, stand down, or dispatch marching orders | `/using-atm` (tending loop) |
| You are running a Brenner-style hypothesis investigation or incident RCA through NTM panes | `brennerbot-with-ntm` |
| You only need Beads or BV mechanics | `/beads-br` or `/beads-bv` |

For any state-changing action, verify the live contract with `ntm --robot-capabilities` before executing.

### Folded triggers (ag-s43tg wave 1): `ntm-browser-test-coordination` + `ntm-review-worker-orchestration` route here

- **Browser/UI test coordination.** Use when coordinating browser or UI tests through NTM panes
  with screenshots and handoffs: dispatch the test run as marching orders to a dedicated pane,
  reserve the surfaces under test via `agent-mail`, keep screenshot/artifact paths in the pane
  output, and confirm completion in `--robot-snapshot` + the attention feed before handing off.
- **Review/analysis workers.** Use when operating an NTM review or
  analysis worker with bounded inputs and evidence-backed output: scope the worker
  to an explicit input set (files, diff, bead),
  require artifact-backed findings (paths + line refs, not impressions), and treat a worker that
  emits conclusions without evidence as not-done — re-dispatch with the bounded-input contract
  restated.

## The Loop (Mandatory)

```
1. DISCOVER   -> ntm --robot-capabilities; ntm --robot-tools; repo AGENTS.md/README.md
2. SNAPSHOT   -> ntm --robot-snapshot; inspect sources/degraded_sources, cursor, sessions, panes
3. SELECT     -> choose the smallest surface: work/assign/send/wait/pipeline/locks/mail
4. PROVE      -> fill the NTM action card: target, contract, safety, ownership, rollback
5. EXECUTE    -> prefer --robot-* for automation; avoid human-only TUIs
6. VERIFY     -> attention/events/causality/tail plus git/br/mail evidence changed as expected
7. CLEANUP    -> release/renew locks, checkpoint/handoff, prune old pipeline state when appropriate
8. REPEAT     -> re-snapshot on cursor expiry or after any state-changing action
```

## NTM Action Card

For every state-changing NTM action, be able to answer this before running it:

```markdown
## NTM action: <command>
- Target session/project: <name/path>; resolved by: `ntm config get projects_base` / `ntm quick` / snapshot
- Live contract checked: `ntm --robot-capabilities` contains <flag>; schema/docs checked if unfamiliar
- Evidence before: cursor=<N>; sources=<fresh/degraded>; panes=<count>; locks=<summary>
- Ownership/safety: Agent Mail reservation or worktree policy is clear; user pane inclusion is intentional
- Blast radius: panes/files/sessions affected; destructive/safety/policy approvals required? <yes/no>
- Verification after: <robot event / tail movement / bead state / git change / pipeline status>
- Recovery: <smart restart / interrupt / checkpoint restore / cancel pipeline / handoff>
```

If you cannot fill the card, do a read-only discovery pass first.

## Surface Selection

Score candidate surfaces when several could work:

```
Score = (ContractFit x Observability x Reversibility) / BlastRadius

ContractFit    1-5: exact robot/schema match beats human help text
Observability  1-5: action emits cursor/event/status/causality evidence
Reversibility  1-5: easy cancel/retry/restore/checkpoint
BlastRadius    1-5: one pane/file is low; whole session/process tree is high
```

Pick the highest score. In ties, prefer the surface that produces structured output. Enumerate candidates from `ntm --robot-docs=commands`, not from memory. Standing preferences:

- `--robot-*` for anything machine-driven; `ntm dashboard` / `ntm palette` / `ntm view` are human-only TUIs.
- `--robot-format=toon` (or `NTM_ROBOT_FORMAT=toon`) and `--robot-verbosity=terse` when context is tight.
- Recovery order: diagnose -> probe / is-working -> smart-restart -> explicit restart. Never kill before a liveness proof.
- Event-driven tending (`--robot-wait` / `--robot-attention`) over fixed sleep/poll loops.

## Pattern Tiers

Escalate only with the action card filled; each tier raises the proof bar:

1. **Tier 1 — safe read-only** (capabilities/schema, snapshot, events/digest/attention, work triage/queue-dry, locks list/check). Always permitted; proof = fresh `sources` / `degraded_sources` reviewed, cursor advancing, no conflicting reservation.
2. **Tier 2 — reversible control** (directed send, interrupt, smart-restart, assign, pipeline cancel/resume). Guard = explicit pane/type scoping, tail/liveness evidence that intervention is warranted, run id and state confirmed.
3. **Tier 3 — durable orchestration** (pipelines, Agent Mail locks, checkpoint/handoff, serve API, safety/policy/approvals). Guard = dry-run first, lease/thread/run ids captured, auth and exposure understood, exit/recovery path named.

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

| Bad move | Why it fails | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| Call `ntm view` from automation | Retiles the human layout and returns nothing useful | `--robot-tail`, `--robot-snapshot`, or `--robot-dashboard` |
| Trust old notes over `--robot-capabilities` | NTM surface changes quickly | Discover first |
| Send to `--all` without naming the user-pane intent | Can hit the operator pane | use type/panes or `-s/--skip-first` |
| Treat cursor values as portable | Cursors are per-server monotonic | checkpoint/handoff for portability |
| Kill/restart before a liveness proof | Destroys partial work | diagnose -> smart restart -> explicit restart |
| Conflate pipeline status and run | `--robot-pipeline=<id>` is status | `--robot-pipeline-run=<file>` |
| Retry degraded mail/CASS forever | Burns the session | record degraded source, use fallback, continue |
| Infer abandoned beads from silence | NTM deliberately does not implement `bead_orphaned` | explicit status/mail/reservation evidence |
| Trust a fresh `spawn --cod` pane blind (bare shell) | Some builds leave a **bare zsh**; prompts execute as shell text | verify with `--robot-tail`; relaunch the CLI, or fall back to `codex exec -C <worktree>` per lane |
| Fire a separate `send` right after a bare `spawn` (boot race) | `spawn` returns **before** the agent boots to its input box; the first send is silently dropped → pane is never-engaged (CLI alive, 0.0% CPU) | wait for input-ready first: `--assign` / `--init-prompt` / `--robot-wait=ready`; if already dropped, **re-dispatch, don't restart** (OC-047) |

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Repo `AGENTS.md` / README read when operating inside a codebase (repo-local rules override this skill).
- [ ] `ntm --robot-capabilities` checked for any unfamiliar flag.
- [ ] `ntm --robot-snapshot` captured and `sources` / `degraded_sources` reviewed.
- [ ] Session/project resolution verified; labels and `projects_base` make sense.
- [ ] User pane inclusion/exclusion is explicit.
- [ ] File ownership is clear: Agent Mail reservation, bead assignee, or approved worktree policy.
- [ ] For pipelines: dry-run passed; run id/state file plan known.
- [ ] For recovery: liveness truth stack supports intervention.
- [ ] For destructive/risky actions: safety/policy/approval surfaces checked.
- [ ] Post-action verifier named before execution.

## Output

NTM actions produce no skill-owned files. The deliverable is verified state plus evidence:

- Structured robot output (JSON or TOON) on stdout from `--robot-*` commands, cited in your report.
- The post-action proof named in the action card: snapshot/attention movement, bead/git/mail change, pipeline status.
- When the surrounding arc requires durable evidence, write it to the repo's evidence path (e.g. an `Evidence:` file under `.agents/` or the path the bead names) — not into this skill.

## Operating Notes (doctrine-critical facts)

- **Project resolution is the #1 cross-tool breakage:** session name MUST equal the directory basename under `projects_base` (`NTM_PROJECTS_BASE`), or agent-mail/beads/reservations register under a different key than NTM sees. If tools "see different projects," fix this first.
- **Coordination default:** Agent Mail reservations are the primary primitive; `--worktrees` isolation is allowed when repo policy permits. If mail/reservations are degraded, record it and use bead assignee/status as the soft lock — no retry loops.
- **Cross-machine continuity** is checkpoint export/import or handoff bundles — never shipped cursors.
- **Safety surfaces are first-class:** use `ntm safety` / `ntm policy` / `ntm approve` (approve takes a *token*, not a bead id) instead of ad hoc shell habits; obey repo rules that route builds through `rch` or similar.
- The full distilled trip-wire list (CASS dedup blocking sends, `--` label separator, send-vs-spawn flag parsers, attention flag namespacing, PATH precedence for safety wrappers, and more) lives in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
