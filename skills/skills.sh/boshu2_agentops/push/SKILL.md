# Push Skill

Atomic test-commit-push workflow. Catches failures before they reach the remote.

## Steps

### Step 1: Detect Project Type

Determine which test suites apply:

- **Go:** Check for `go.mod` (or `cli/go.mod`). If found, Go tests apply.
- **Python:** Check for `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py`. If found, Python tests apply.
- **Shell:** Check for modified `.sh` files. If found, shellcheck applies (if installed).

### Step 2: Run Tests

Run ALL applicable test suites. Do NOT skip any.

**Go projects:**
```bash
cd cli && go vet ./...
cd cli && go test ./... -count=1 -short
```

Run the **whole** suite (`./...`), never a `-run <feature>` subset. A filtered
run stays green while cross-cutting tests (conformance, surface-parity) are red —
they only surface at push, after you have already reported "green."

**Python projects:**
```bash
python -m pytest --tb=short -q
```

**Shell scripts (if shellcheck available):**
```bash
shellcheck <modified .sh files>
```

If ANY test fails: **STOP.** Fix the failures before continuing. Do not commit broken code.

### Step 2.5: Run the repo's own pre-push gate + regenerate derived artifacts

`go test` green does **not** mean the push will pass. Repos with a pre-push gate
also enforce **derived/generated artifacts** — generated CLI docs, registries,
command-surface matrices, conformance trees, codex twins — that unit tests never
touch. Discovering these at `git push` (after you reported "done") is the most
common late failure.

Before staging, if the repo has any of these, run its **regen + check locally**:

- A gate runner / pre-push hook (run it directly, don't wait for the push).
- A derived-scope or codegen finalizer after you touched a generating source
  (e.g. you added a CLI command/flag, a skill, or a schema). In AgentOps:
  `bash scripts/regen-changed-scope.sh --scope head` and
  `bash scripts/generate-cli-reference.sh`; for skills, scope the codex-twin
  regen to your skills (`scripts/regen-codex-hashes.sh --only <names>`).
- Commit the regenerated artifacts **with** the change, not as a follow-up.

Rule of thumb: **if you changed a file that generates another file, regenerate
the other file now.** The gate that fails is the one whose globs you didn't
think your change touched.

### Step 3: Stage Changes

```bash
git add <specific files>
```

Stage only the files relevant to the current work. Do NOT use `git add -A` unless the user explicitly requests it. Review untracked files and skip anything that looks like secrets, temp files, or build artifacts.

### Step 4: Write Commit Message

Write a conventional commit message based on the diff:

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Focus on WHY, not WHAT

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "<message>"
```

### Step 6: Sync with Remote

```bash
git pull --rebase origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

If rebase conflicts occur: resolve them, re-run tests, then continue.

### Step 7: Push

```bash
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### Step 8: Report

Output a summary:
- Files changed count
- Tests passed (with suite names)
- Commit hash
- Branch pushed to

## Guardrails

- NEVER push to `main` or `master` without explicit user confirmation
- NEVER stage files matching: `.env*`, `*credentials*`, `*secret*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`
- If tests were not run (no test suite found), WARN the user before committing
- If `git pull --rebase` fails, do NOT force push — ask the user

## Examples

### Pushing Changes

**User says:** `/push`

**What happens:**
1. Runs Go and Python tests
2. Commits with conventional message
3. Pushes to current branch

**Result:** Verified, committed, and pushed changes in one atomic workflow.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Tests fail | Code has errors | Fix failing tests before retrying |
| Push rejected | Remote has new commits | Pull and rebase, then retry |
| No changes to commit | Working tree is clean | Make changes first |
