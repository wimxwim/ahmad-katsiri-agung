# /rpi - Full Lifecycle Orchestrator

> Quick ref: `/discovery` -> `/crank` -> `/validate`, then report.

**Execute this workflow. Do not only describe it.** RPI is autonomous unless
`--interactive` is set. The user touchpoint is after validation, or after a
real blocked state exhausts retries. Read
[references/autonomous-execution.md](references/autonomous-execution.md) when
you need the full autonomy contract.

**`--auto` means *pivot autonomously*, NOT *execute the initial plan to the letter*.** Autonomy is agility, not waterfall: between waves the orchestrator re-plans the remaining work and changes course on its own — refactoring, adding, dropping, reordering waves as evidence arrives — without the operator saying so (touched only at the terminal objective or a circuit-breaker trip). See [Agile Re-Plan Loop](#agile-re-plan-loop-the-anti-waterfall-rule).

## Loop position

`/rpi` is the orchestrator across **every move** of the [operating loop](../../docs/architecture/operating-loop.md): BDD intent → vertical slices → conflict-free wave → bead acceptance → evidence + learning capture. It delegates each move to the skill that owns it (`/discovery`, `/plan`, `/crank`, `/validate`, `/curate --mode=forge`/`/post-mortem`), and enforces these loop-level invariants:

- **Agile, not waterfall — the plan is a hypothesis.** Every wave closes with a **re-plan, not just a retry** (the [Agile Re-Plan Loop](#agile-re-plan-loop-the-anti-waterfall-rule), autonomous under `--auto`).
- **No move-skipping, but validation cadence is pawl-gated, not per-tread** ([docs/contracts/pawls.md](../../docs/contracts/pawls.md)). Strict delegation is on by default; phases never compress; the lifecycle objective is preserved across the loop. "Validation cannot be skipped" means the *bead-acceptance pawl* validates fully — NOT that every intermediate slice pays the heavy cross-family panel. The acceptance roll-up + heavy gates (full council, `/validate --mixed`, `/pre-land-refuters`) fire **once, at the bead-acceptance / merge-to-main pawl** (the ratchet's lock). Intermediate slices are **chaos**: cheap local checks (build, TDD red→green, light inline wave-acceptance judges) run freely; the heavy panel never fires per slice. A pawl on every tread is the waterfall the ratchet exists to avoid.
- **The first failing test is the bead's contract.** With `--test-first` on (the default), `/crank` is invoked with the TDD-per-slice discipline; `--no-test-first` is an explicit opt-out, not a fast path.
- **Acceptance examples close the bead, not activity.** Validation FAIL re-cranks on the same objective up to 3 attempts; DONE requires the acceptance roll-up in the [slice-validation template](../../docs/templates/slice-validation.md) to be fully green.
- **Ports stay visible.** Preserve the [Intent-to-Loop Hexagon](../../docs/architecture/intent-to-loop-hexagon.md) boundary as the objective crosses `shape_intent`, `persist_intent`, `plan_slices`, `execute_wave`, `validate_acceptance`, and `record_evidence`.
- **Context density survives phase boundaries.** Apply the [Context Density Rule](../domain/references/context-density-rule.md) to every phase handoff and final report: keep intent, boundary, evidence, decision, constraint, and next action; omit or link anything else.

### Folded triggers (ag-s43tg): `operating-loop-skill` + `operating-loop-workflow` route here

- **operating-loop-skill** — driving one bead end-to-end through claim, work, independent validation, closeout, and persistence: `/rpi <bead-id>` runs that exact arc.
- **operating-loop-workflow** — installing or running the seven-move operating-loop Workflow for AgentOps plugin users and multi-agent orchestration: `/rpi` is the in-session orchestrator of the same seven moves.

## Core Contract

RPI delegates via `Skill(skill="discovery", ...)`,
`Skill(skill="crank", ...)`, and `Skill(skill="validate", ...)` as separate
tool invocations. Keep strict delegation on by default; do not compress phases,
replace phase skills with direct agent spawns, or skip validation. Read
[../shared/references/strict-delegation-contract.md](../shared/references/strict-delegation-contract.md)
for the full anti-compression contract.
See [references/isolation-contract.md](references/isolation-contract.md) for
the four-lever model, phase-isolated skill transport, and the compression
patterns `scripts/check-skill-isolation.sh` flags. See
[references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md) for the principle
and anti-pattern citation table.

When the runtime supports phase isolation, keep `/rpi` visible in the main
session and run each phase contract through isolated transport: phase skill name in, bounded handoff artifact in, phase artifact/verdict/next action out.
The transport may be a daemon job, process runner, or subagent wrapper, but it must execute the declared phase skill contract rather than doing phase work directly.

RPI owns one lifecycle objective across all phases. Preserve the discovered
`epic_id` when present; otherwise preserve the original goal and execution
packet objective. A child bead or one ready slice is context, not a replacement
objective. `<promise>PARTIAL</promise>` from `/crank` means retry Phase 2 on the
same objective.

## Route And Classify

1. Create `.agents/rpi/`.
2. Resolve `--from`:
   - default, `research`, `plan`, `pre-mortem`, `brainstorm` -> discovery
   - `implementation` or `crank` -> implementation
   - `validation`, `vibe`, or `post-mortem` -> validation
3. If the input is a bead and `--from` is absent, resolve it with `br show`:
   - epic -> implementation with that epic
   - child with parent -> implementation with the parent epic
4. Classify complexity:
   - `fast`: short/simple goal or `--fast-path`
   - `standard`: medium goal or one scope keyword
   - `full`: `--deep`, complex-operation keyword, 2+ scope keywords, or >120 chars
5. Log `RPI mode: rpi-phased (complexity: <level>)`.

Track state compactly:

```text
rpi_state = {
  goal: "<goal string>",
  epic_id: null,
  phase: "<discovery|implementation|validation>",
  complexity: "<fast|standard|full>",
  test_first: <true by default; false only when --no-test-first>,
  cycle: 1,
  verdicts: {}
}
```

Complex-operation keywords include `refactor`, `migrate`, `rewrite`,
`redesign`, `rearchitect`, `overhaul`, `decouple`, `deprecate`, `split`,
`extract module`, and `port`. Scope keywords include `all`, `entire`, `across`,
`everywhere`, `every file`, `system-wide`, `global`, and `codebase`.

## Phase DAG

Enter at the routed phase and run every phase after it.

1. **Discovery:** invoke `/discovery <goal> [--interactive] --complexity=<level>`
   directly or through phase-isolated skill transport.
   On DONE, read `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` or the run archive and
   preserve its objective spine. On BLOCKED, stop with the discovery verdict.
2. **Implementation:** invoke `/crank <epic-id>` when the packet has `epic_id`;
   otherwise invoke `/crank .agents/rpi/execution-packet.json`, directly or
   through phase-isolated skill transport. Pass `--test-first` or
   `--no-test-first` through. On DONE, record `ao ratchet record implement
   2>/dev/null || true` and continue. On PARTIAL or BLOCKED, retry the same
   objective up to 3 total attempts. **Before accepting a slice/wave the orchestrator reads the actual diff itself** (scope + claim match) — not just the `<promise>DONE</promise>` and evidence JSON, but its own diff-read, distinct from the delegated sub-judges.
   `/crank` enforces this as the anti-green-washing Step 3.5 of its Wave Acceptance ([crank wave-patterns.md §Wave Acceptance Check](../crank/references/wave-patterns.md)).
3. **Validation:** invoke `/validate <epic-id> --complexity=<level>` when an
   epic exists; otherwise invoke `/validate --complexity=<level>`, directly
   or through phase-isolated skill transport. Add `--strict-surfaces` when
   `--quality` is set. On FAIL, extract findings, re-run `/crank` on the same
   objective, then re-run `/validate`, up to 3 total validation attempts. On
   DONE, record `ao ratchet record vibe 2>/dev/null || true`. This Phase-3 `/validate` is the **bead-acceptance pawl** ([docs/contracts/pawls.md](../../docs/contracts/pawls.md)) — once per RPI objective at acceptance, not per slice. **The merge-to-main pawl fires regardless of complexity:** any work crossing the shared-trunk door — fast/standard included — invokes the pawl gate [`/pre-land-refuters`](../pre-land-refuters/SKILL.md) before push (pawls.md makes mutate-shared-trunk complexity-independent). Complexity scales the gate's DEPTH, never exempts it: every door gets at least the **fresh-context default** (≥1 fresh-context refuter, model-agnostic); higher-irreversibility doors are opted up to **multi-model** (≥2 distinct families), and `full` arcs (100+ files, factory regen, contract-test repoints, capability removal) get full council — neither skips the gate. **REFUTED → AUTO-REDO**: refuted findings re-crank like a validation FAIL, autonomously and with no human (the default self-correcting path); a human is escalated to **only when a tunable circuit breaker trips** (max-attempts — here the 3-attempt cap — time budget, cost/quota, or oscillation), per pawls.md "Escalation — the circuit-breaker model". The gate is the door, never per slice.
4. **Re-plan (mandatory between waves; the loop's hinge).** With remaining waves, run the [Agile Re-Plan Loop](#agile-re-plan-loop-the-anti-waterfall-rule) before the next — a post-mortem/discovery delta that MAY mutate the remaining plan (autonomous under `--auto`). No remaining waves → straight to Report.
5. **Report:** summarize phase verdicts, the re-plan deltas taken, and epic
   status using [references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md).
   With `--loop`, restart from discovery on FAIL while `cycle < max_cycles`. With
   `--spawn-next`, read `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` and suggest the next
   command without invoking it. Before emitting the report, apply the Context
   Density Rule: every line should carry intent, boundary, evidence, decision,
   constraint, or next action.

## Agile Re-Plan Loop (the anti-waterfall rule)

The initial plan is a **hypothesis**; each wave is an experiment whose evidence re-plans the rest. At every wave boundary (and after validation): **reflect** (a bounded `/post-mortem` + `/discovery` re-plan delta over what shipped/broke) → **re-plan the REMAINING waves** (refactor / insert / drop / reorder / re-scope / escalate, persisting the mutated plan so the next wave reads the *current* one) → **proceed**. Under `--auto` this is autonomous, bounded by the run's circuit breakers (budget / attempt cap / oscillation detection) and the ≥5-ship post-mortem checkpoint; the operator is touched only at the terminal objective or a breaker trip. `/crank` and `/validate` surface findings UP for re-planning (never a silent local retry); `/discovery` is the re-plan engine. Anti-patterns: **waterfall** (run the plan to the letter), **retry-not-replan** (re-crank forever instead of changing the remaining plan), **permission-seeking** (pause to approve a pivot `--auto` already authorizes). **Full detail:** [references/agile-replan-loop.md](references/agile-replan-loop.md).

## Phase Data Contract

The execution packet carries the repo execution profile through
`contract_surfaces`, `done_criteria`, and queue claim/finalize metadata. Keep
the latest alias at `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` and read
[references/phase-data-contracts.md](references/phase-data-contracts.md) for
schemas and archive paths.

## Complexity-Scaled Gates

> The pawl gates ([pawls.md](../../docs/contracts/pawls.md)) fire at the irreversible doors — bead-acceptance and merge-to-main — never per slice/wave; chaos between pawls. The merge-to-main pawl fires **regardless of complexity** (see Phase 3); complexity below only scales the DEPTH of the gate, never whether it runs.

Complexity scales the gate's depth: `low`/`fast` and `medium`/`standard` → 2-judge minimum panel (inline / `--quick`); `high`/`full` → full council; max 3 total attempts. The gate still fires at the door at every complexity.

- **Pre-mortem** (planning-time, chaos-side — NOT a pawl): `high`/`full` → full council, 2-judge minimum; max 3 total attempts. Pre-mortem stress-tests the plan before work; it is not an irreversible door and carries no heavy gate of its own outside this optional `full`-arc depth.
- **Final Vibe** (at the bead-acceptance pawl): `high`/`full` → full council, 2-judge minimum; max 3 total attempts.
- **Post-mortem** (STEP 2, at the bead-acceptance pawl): `high`/`full` → full council; same scale as above.

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--from=<phase>` | discovery | Start at discovery, implementation, or validation |
| `--discovery-artifact=<path>` | unset | With implementation start, convert an existing artifact into the handoff packet |
| `--interactive` | off | Human gates in discovery/validate |
| `--auto` | on | Fully autonomous default — **pivots between waves on its own** (re-plans remaining work; not a fixed-plan/waterfall executor). See [Agile Re-Plan Loop](#agile-re-plan-loop-the-anti-waterfall-rule) |
| `--loop --max-cycles=<n>` | off / 3 | Iterate when validation fails |
| `--spawn-next` | off | Surface follow-up work after reporting |
| `--test-first` | on | Pass strict-quality preference to `/crank` |
| `--no-test-first` | off | Explicitly opt out of strict-quality |
| `--fast-path` / `--deep` | auto | Force fast or full complexity |
| `--quality` | off | Make validation strict surfaces blocking |
| `--dry-run` / `--no-budget` | off | Report only, or disable phase time budgets |

## Examples

- `/rpi "add user authentication"` — discovery → implementation → validation → report.
- `/rpi --from=implementation ag-23k` — resolve the bead scope, run implementation + validation.
- `/rpi --deep "refactor payment module"` — full council gates across the lifecycle.

Read [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for resume, interactive, loop, and artifact-mode examples.

## Output Specification

**Format:** a markdown report to stdout ([report-template](references/report-template.md)) — phase verdicts, re-plan deltas, and epic status.
**Files:** reads/updates `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` (+ `runs/<id>/`) and `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` (with `--spawn-next`); records `ao ratchet record` per phase.
**Exit signal:** the per-phase verdict roll-up; `<promise>PARTIAL</promise>` from `/crank` means retry Phase 2 on the same objective.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Discovery BLOCKED | Stop and report discovery's manual-intervention reason |
| `/crank` returns PARTIAL | Retry `/crank` on the same objective; do not narrow to a child slice |
| Validation FAIL | Re-crank with findings, then re-validate, up to 3 total attempts |
| Packet shape unclear | Read [references/phase-data-contracts.md](references/phase-data-contracts.md) |
| External executor fails | Read [references/codex-executor.md](references/codex-executor.md), run direct Codex validation, and only create follow-up work for reproducible source failures |
