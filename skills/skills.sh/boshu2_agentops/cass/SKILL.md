# cass Session Search

> **Core Insight:** Your repeated prompts are your best prompts. If you typed it 10+ times, it works. Mine your history.

`cass` is an upstream (Dicklesworthstone) tool and is **self-describing** — do not re-learn its surface from this skill. Discover it live:

```bash
cass capabilities --json      # features/connectors/limits of the installed binary
cass introspect --json        # full schema of every command + response
cass robot-docs guide|commands|examples|schemas|contracts   # machine-targeted docs
```

This skill carries only the AgentOps operating doctrine: when to reach for cass, the discovery workflow, the recovery posture, and the anti-patterns we have actually hit.

## When to Use

- "What did I ask last time?" / "find that prompt that worked" — session archaeology
- Prior-art check before inventing a new approach, plan, or prompt
- Scope archaeology: "when did we decide NOT to do X?"
- Post-context-loss recovery: what was searched for after a crash = what mattered

### Folded triggers (ag-s43tg wave 1): `casr` + `cass-memory` route here

- **`casr` → cross-harness resume.** Cross Agent Session Resumer: convert and resume sessions across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and other providers — `cass resume` plus [RESUME.md](references/RESUME.md) own this lane (resolve subagent logs to their parent via `cass context` first; subagent files are not resumable).
- **`cass-memory` → `cm` procedural memory.** Use when starting non-trivial work, mining lessons, or preventing repeated mistakes with cm procedural memory — mine past sessions here first, then promote the durable lessons through `cm` instead of re-deriving them each session.

## The Goldmine Principle

Your conversation history contains:
- **Refined prompts** — Every rephrase that worked better was captured
- **Working rituals** — Prompts repeated 10+ times ARE your methodology
- **Scope decisions** — "When did we decide NOT to do X?"
- **Recovery moments** — What you searched for after context loss = what mattered

**The insight:** Mining your past beats inventing new approaches. In the AgentOps loop the goal is prior-art first: mine as a research-phase move before writing a fresh plan or prompt, and feed what you find back into the corpus instead of re-deriving it.

## THE EXACT PROMPT — Discovery Workflow

```
1. Bootstrap: Check health, refresh index, get project overview
   cass status --json && cass index --json
   cass search "*" --workspace /data/projects/PROJECT --aggregate agent,date --limit 1 --json

2. Find prompts: Search for keywords, filter to user prompts (lines 1-3)
   cass search "KEYWORD" --workspace /data/projects/PROJECT --json --fields minimal --limit 50 \
     | jq '[.hits[] | select(.line_number <= 3)]'

3. Follow hits: View the actual content
   cass view /path/from/source_path.jsonl -n LINE -C 20

4. Expand context: See the full conversation flow
   cass expand /path/from/source_path.jsonl --line LINE --context 3

5. Discover related: Find the whole work cluster
   cass context /path/from/source_path.jsonl --json
```

Why it works: aggregations first (know the terrain), `--fields minimal` (5x smaller output), `line_number <= 3` (user prompts live at the top), context clustering (one good hit → many related sessions). >10 matches for a prompt = a ritual; document and reuse it.

## Operating Doctrine: Stale ≠ Broken

Three index states matter — never conflate them:

| State | Meaning | Do |
|-------|---------|----|
| `cass health` exit 0 | Healthy | Search immediately |
| stale (`index.stale=true`) | Usable but old | Search NOW; refresh in background with a wall-clock cap: `( timeout 600 cass index --json &>/tmp/cass-bg.log </dev/null & )` — NEVER a bare `&`, cass index can hang |
| broken (`database.exists=false` or `documents=0`) | Truly uninitialized | `cass doctor --fix --json`, then `cass index --full --json` |

The trap: treating stale as broken triggers an unneeded 8–25s full rebuild when a 1–3s incremental (or a stale-but-correct query) would do. `scripts/recover.sh` implements the full decision tree with timeouts. Detailed symptom→fix tables (issue #196 hang, stale locks, `database is busy` race, etc.): [RECOVERY.md](references/RECOVERY.md), [OBSERVABILITY.md](references/OBSERVABILITY.md), [PITFALLS.md](references/PITFALLS.md).

## Version Pinning

cass evolves quickly; the released binary may lack HEAD features. When a flag returns "unrecognized", do not guess — probe: `cass capabilities --json` and `cass introspect --json | jq '.commands[].name'`, and check `cass --version`.

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do These)

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | Do instead |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Asking the user "should I rebuild the index?" | They have agents waiting; rebuild is safe and idempotent | Just run `cass doctor --fix --json` (preserves source data) |
| Running `cass index --full` whenever `status` says unhealthy | A 25s rebuild for a 30-min stale index is wasteful | Check `index.stale` separately from `database.exists`; prefer incremental |
| Running bare `cass` to "see what's there" | Launches blocking TUI in the agent's session | Always `--json` or `--robot`; never bare |
| Piping `cass export` into `head`/`jq` | Broken-pipe panic on large sessions | `cass export ... -o /tmp/x.json` first, then operate on the file |
| Treating subagent files as parent sessions | Subagents are separate logs with their own line-2 prompt; also NOT resumable | Filter by `select(.source_path \| contains("subagent"))`; resolve to parent via `cass context` before `cass resume` |
| Using `--limit 0` for "no limit" | Earlier cass panics | Use a real limit (`--limit 50`); `--limit 1` minimum for aggregations |
| Trusting 0 hits with `--workspace /X` | Workspace strings are case- and trailing-slash-sensitive | Re-run with `--aggregate workspace --limit 1` to discover the canonical key |
| Skipping `--fields minimal` on wide scans | ~3KB per hit × 100 hits = 300KB context burn | `--fields minimal` for wide passes; upgrade to `summary`/`full` for keepers |
| Reading session files with `cat` | Loads the full conversation into context | `cass view PATH -n LINE -C 5` or `cass expand PATH --line LINE --context 3` |
| Re-indexing on every search | Index is shared across processes | Refresh only when `status` says stale |
| Falling back to manual `find`/`grep` when cass misbehaves | Recovery is autonomous; skipping cass loses the corpus | Walk the recovery tree in [RECOVERY.md](references/RECOVERY.md). One real exception: terms inside tool stdout/stderr are skipped at index time — there `rg -n "TERM" /path.jsonl` is correct |

## Safety Boundaries

Pre-authorized (rebuilds derived index data only, never destroys source sessions): `cass doctor --fix --json`, `cass index --full --force-rebuild --json`, `cass sources doctor/sync`, `cass models install/verify`.

Do NOT without explicit permission: delete `core.NNNNN` coredumps, delete `.beads/`, `git reset --hard`, or hand-edit `~/.config/cass/sources.toml` — the CLI commands above already do everything safely. Never run bare `cass` (blocking TUI) inside an agent loop.

When the right reference isn't obvious from titles, `grep -ni "SYMPTOM" references/*.md` — cheaper than loading whole files into context.

## Scripts

Scripts live under `scripts/`. They execute, never load — zero context tokens. None mutate state without explicit confirmation.

| Script | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| `./scripts/quick_analysis.sh /path` | One-command project overview (status → aggregate agent/date → top prompts) |
| `./scripts/prompt_miner.py --workspace /path` | Find repeated prompts (ritual detection) |
| `./scripts/validate.sh` | Validate cass install + skill structure |
| `./scripts/recover.sh` | Autonomous recovery decision tree (READY → STALE_BUT_USABLE → BROKEN); wraps every `cass index` in `timeout` |
| `./scripts/multi_machine_search.sh "QUERY" [host…]` | Parallel fan-out across the fleet; merges + dedups hits |

## Validation

```bash
# Quick health check
cass status --json | jq '.index.fresh'

# Should return: true
```

If `false`, run: `cass index --json`
