# Workflow Builder — scaffold a Claude Workflow script

> Counterpart to `skill-builder`. `skill-builder` authors a `SKILL.md` (a leaf
> capability); this authors a **Workflow** (a composite capability — deterministic
> orchestration of subagents). Reach this skill via `automation-shape-routing`
> once the shape is confirmed **Workflow** (deterministic DAG + structured-JSON
> returns + headless). If the shape is NTM or plain skill, you're in the wrong
> builder — go back to `automation-shape-routing`.

## Confirm the shape first

Do NOT scaffold a workflow for: an attach-and-steer run (→ NTM: `ntm` /
`using-atm`), or a hard-sequential edit-loop with no parallelism (→ plain
skill: `skill-builder`). If unconfirmed, run `automation-shape-routing`.

## The template

Start from `.claude/workflows/operating-loop.js` — the canonical worked example.
Copy its skeleton, don't reinvent it. A Workflow script is plain JS:

```js
export const meta = {                 // REQUIRED — pure literal, no variables
  name: 'my-workflow',
  description: 'one line shown in the permission dialog',
  phases: [ { title: 'Find' }, { title: 'Verify' } ],  // one per phase() call
}

phase('Find')
const found = await parallel(FINDERS.map(f => () =>
  agent(f.prompt, { schema: FINDINGS_SCHEMA, phase: 'Find' })))   // barrier

phase('Verify')
const verified = await pipeline(found.flat().filter(Boolean),
  f => agent(`verify: ${f.title}`, { schema: VERDICT, phase: 'Verify' }))

return { verified }
```

## Building blocks (pick by control-flow shape)

| Primitive | Use when |
|---|---|
| `agent(prompt, {schema})` | one subagent; `schema` forces structured JSON back |
| `parallel([thunks])` | **barrier** — need ALL results together (dedup/merge/early-exit) |
| `pipeline(items, ...stages)` | **default** multi-stage — no barrier, each item flows independently |
| `phase(title)` | progress grouping; match `meta.phases` titles |
| `loop-until-budget` / `loop-until-dry` | unknown-size discovery; guard on `budget.total` |

## Conformance — author it as a control system, not a DAG

A workflow is an **orchestrator** (it gates and routes), so it must be a
traversable control system, not an open-loop DAG. Before scaffolding, read
**[the Workflow Conformance Pattern](../../docs/architecture/workflow-conformance-pattern.md)**
— the copy-paste idiom for the four moves (dispatch skills as black-box
schema-returning agents · gate on a delegated deterministic verdict, never a
self-grade · the bounded-loop guard idiom · orchestrator-routes-never-reasons)
plus the §6 five-rule self-check header to paste into your script and the
`workflows:` ledger row `scripts/check-workflow-governance.sh` requires. That doc
operationalizes [control-loop-model.md §6](../../docs/architecture/control-loop-model.md);
this skill scaffolds the script that satisfies it.

## Authoring checklist

1. **Shape confirmed Workflow** (via `automation-shape-routing`).
2. **Schemas first** — define the JSON schema each `agent()` returns; structured
   output is what makes a workflow deterministic and composable.
3. **Default to `pipeline()`**; reach for `parallel()` only when a stage genuinely
   needs all prior results at once.
4. **Conflict-free fan-out** — if branches write files, give each a disjoint
   write-scope (the wave-validity invariant) or run in worktree isolation.
5. **Budget** — for loops, gate on `budget.total && budget.remaining() > N`.
6. **Conformance self-check** — paste the §6 five-rule header from the
   [conformance pattern](../../docs/architecture/workflow-conformance-pattern.md)
   and mark each rule ✓/HARDENED/PENDING honestly; add the `workflows:` ledger
   row and run `scripts/check-workflow-governance.sh`.
7. **Dry-run to validate** — invoke the workflow on a tiny input; confirm the
   `meta` block parses and each phase returns its schema. This is the workflow
   analog of the heal-skill deep audit (`audit.sh`).

## Relationship to the SDK

A workflow is a **composite capability**; the portable contract for it (a
`shape: skill|workflow` discriminator, a `StepGraph`, a `control_flow` enum, a
`budget`, an `OrchestrationPort` interface) is net-new `agentops-core-sdk` work.
Author the script here; the SDK is where the *contract* for workflow-capabilities
lives. See `operating-loop-workflow` for installing/running a finished workflow.
