# Bluesky CLI

Interact with Bluesky/AT Protocol from the command line.

## Setup

First-time setup requires an app password from Bluesky:
1. Go to bsky.app → Settings → Privacy and Security → App Passwords
2. Create a new app password
3. Run: `bsky login --handle yourhandle.bsky.social --password xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`

**Security:** Password is NOT stored. The CLI exports a session token on login, which auto-refreshes. Your app password only exists in memory during login.

## Commands

```bash
# Authentication
bsky login --handle user.bsky.social --password xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
bsky whoami

# Timeline
bsky timeline              # Show home feed (10 posts)
bsky timeline -n 20        # Show 20 posts
bsky tl                    # Alias

# Posting
bsky post "Hello world!"   # Create a post
bsky p "Short post"        # Alias
bsky post "Test" --dry-run # Preview without posting

# Version
bsky --version             # Show version

# Delete
bsky delete <post_id>      # Delete a post by ID or URL
bsky rm <url>              # Alias

# Profiles
bsky profile               # Your profile
bsky profile @someone.bsky.social

# Search
bsky search "query"        # Search posts
bsky search "offsec" -n 20

# Notifications
bsky notifications         # Likes, reposts, follows, mentions
bsky notif -n 30           # Alias with count
```

## Output Format

Timeline and search results show:
```
@handle · Jan 25 14:30
  Post text (truncated to 200 chars)
  ❤️ likes  🔁 reposts  💬 replies
  🔗 https://bsky.app/profile/handle/post/id
```

## Installation

The skill uses a Python virtual environment. On first run:
```bash
cd {baseDir}/scripts
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip install atproto
```

Then run commands via:
```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/venv/bin/python {baseDir}/scripts/bsky.py [command]
```

Or use the wrapper script:
```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/bsky [command]
```
