# Web Search Plus

Multi-provider web search with **Intelligent Auto-Routing**: Serper (Google), Tavily (Research), Exa (Neural).

**NEW in v2.3.0**: Interactive setup wizard! Run `python3 scripts/setup.py` for guided configuration.

**NEW in v2.2.5**: Automatic error fallback — if one provider fails (rate limit, timeout, etc.), automatically tries the next provider in priority order!

---

## 🚀 First Run (Setup Wizard)

New to web-search-plus? The interactive setup wizard guides you through configuration:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup.py
```

The wizard will:
1. **Explain each provider** — What they're best for, free tier limits, signup links
2. **Ask which providers to enable** — You can use 1, 2, or all 3
3. **Collect API keys** — Keys are stored locally in `config.json` (gitignored)
4. **Configure defaults** — Default provider, auto-routing, result count

### What Each Provider Is Best For

| Provider | Best For | Free Tier |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Serper** | Google results, shopping, prices, local businesses, news | 2,500/month |
| **Tavily** | Research questions, explanations, academic, full-page content | 1,000/month |
| **Exa** | Semantic search, "similar to X", startup discovery, papers | 1,000/month |

### Reconfigure Anytime

```bash
python3 scripts/setup.py --reset
```

---

## 🔑 API Keys Setup (Manual)

**NEW in v2.2.0**: The script **auto-loads** API keys from `.env` in the skill directory!

### Quick Setup

**Option A: .env file** (recommended)
```bash
# /path/to/skills/web-search-plus/.env
export SERPER_API_KEY="your-key"   # https://serper.dev
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-key"   # https://tavily.com  
export EXA_API_KEY="your-key"      # https://exa.ai
```

**Option B: config.json** (NEW in v2.2.1)
```bash
# Copy the example config
cp config.example.json config.json
```
Then add your keys:
```json
{
  "serper": { "api_key": "your-serper-key" },
  "tavily": { "api_key": "your-tavily-key" },
  "exa": { "api_key": "your-exa-key" }
}
```
⚠️ `config.json` is gitignored — your keys stay safe!

Just run — keys load automatically:
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py -q "your query"
# No need for 'source .env' anymore! ✨
```

**Priority:** config.json > .env > environment variable

### Get Free API Keys

| Provider | Free Tier | Sign Up |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Serper | 2,500 queries/mo | https://serper.dev |
| Tavily | 1,000 queries/mo | https://tavily.com |
| Exa | 1,000 queries/mo | https://exa.ai |

## ⚠️ Don't Modify Core OpenClaw Config

**Tavily, Serper, and Exa are NOT core OpenClaw providers.**

❌ **DON'T** add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
```json
"tools": { "web": { "search": { "provider": "tavily" }}}  // WRONG!
```

✅ **DO** use this skill's scripts — keys auto-load from `.env`

Core OpenClaw only supports `brave` as the built-in web search provider. This skill adds Serper, Tavily, and Exa as **additional** options via its own scripts.

---

## 🧠 Intelligent Auto-Routing

No need to choose a provider — just search! The skill uses **multi-signal analysis** to understand your query intent:

```bash
# These queries are intelligently routed with confidence scoring:
python3 scripts/search.py -q "how much does iPhone 16 cost"     # → Serper (68% MEDIUM)
python3 scripts/search.py -q "how does quantum entanglement work"  # → Tavily (86% HIGH)
python3 scripts/search.py -q "startups similar to Notion"       # → Exa (76% HIGH)
python3 scripts/search.py -q "MacBook Pro M3 specs review"      # → Serper (70% HIGH)
python3 scripts/search.py -q "explain pros and cons of React"   # → Tavily (85% HIGH)
python3 scripts/search.py -q "companies like stripe.com"        # → Exa (100% HIGH)
```

### How It Works

The routing engine analyzes multiple signals:

#### 🛒 Shopping Intent → Serper
| Signal Type | Examples | Weight |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Price patterns | "how much", "price of", "cost of" | HIGH |
| Purchase intent | "buy", "purchase", "order", "where to buy" | HIGH |
| Deal signals | "deal", "discount", "cheap", "best price" | MEDIUM |
| Product + Brand | "iPhone 16", "Sony headphones" + specs/review | HIGH |
| Local business | "near me", "restaurants", "hotels" | HIGH |

#### 📚 Research Intent → Tavily
| Signal Type | Examples | Weight |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Explanation | "how does", "why does", "explain", "what is" | HIGH |
| Analysis | "compare", "pros and cons", "difference between" | HIGH |
| Learning | "tutorial", "guide", "understand", "learn" | MEDIUM |
| Depth | "in-depth", "comprehensive", "detailed" | MEDIUM |
| Complex queries | Long, multi-clause questions | BONUS |

#### 🔍 Discovery Intent → Exa
| Signal Type | Examples | Weight |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Similarity | "similar to", "alternatives to", "competitors" | VERY HIGH |
| Company discovery | "companies like", "startups doing", "who else" | HIGH |
| URL detection | Any URL or domain (stripe.com) | VERY HIGH |
| Academic | "arxiv", "research papers", "github projects" | HIGH |
| Funding | "Series A", "YC", "funded startup" | HIGH |

### Confidence Scoring

Every routing decision includes a confidence level:

| Confidence | Level | Meaning |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 70-100% | **HIGH** | Strong signal match, very reliable |
| 40-69% | **MEDIUM** | Good match, should work well |
| 0-39% | **LOW** | Ambiguous query, using fallback |

### Debug Routing Decisions

See the full analysis:

```bash
python3 scripts/search.py --explain-routing -q "how much does iPhone 16 Pro cost"
```

Output:
```json
{
  "query": "how much does iPhone 16 Pro cost",
  "routing_decision": {
    "provider": "serper",
    "confidence": 0.68,
    "confidence_level": "medium",
    "reason": "moderate_confidence_match"
  },

## FAQ

### General

**Q: How does auto-routing decide which provider to use?**
> Multi-signal analysis scores each provider based on: price patterns, explanation phrases, similarity keywords, URLs, product+brand combos, and query complexity. Highest score wins. Use `--explain-routing` to see the decision breakdown.

**Q: What if it picks the wrong provider?**
> Override with `-p serper/tavily/exa`. Check `--explain-routing` to understand why it chose differently.

**Q: What does "low confidence" mean?**
> Query is ambiguous (e.g., "Tesla" could be cars, stock, or company). Falls back to Serper. Results may vary.

**Q: Can I disable a provider?**
> Yes! In config.json: `"disabled_providers": ["exa"]`

### API Keys

**Q: Which API keys do I need?**
> At minimum ONE key. You can use just Serper, just Tavily, or all three. Missing keys = that provider is skipped.

**Q: Where do I get API keys?**
> - Serper: https://serper.dev (2,500 free queries, no credit card)
> - Tavily: https://tavily.com (1,000 free searches/month)
> - Exa: https://exa.ai (1,000 free searches/month)

**Q: How do I set API keys?**
> Two options (both auto-load):
> 
> **Option A: .env file**
> ```bash
> export SERPER_API_KEY="your-key"
> ```
> 
> **Option B: config.json** (v2.2.1+)
> ```json
> { "serper": { "api_key": "your-key" } }
> ```

### Routing Details

**Q: How do I know which provider handled my search?**
> Check `routing.provider` in JSON output, or `[🔍 Searched with: Provider]` in chat responses.

**Q: Why does it sometimes choose Serper for research questions?**
> If the query has brand/product signals (e.g., "how does Tesla FSD work"), shopping intent may outweigh research intent. Override with `-p tavily`.

**Q: What's the confidence threshold?**
> Default: 0.3 (30%). Below this = low confidence, uses fallback. Adjustable in config.json.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: "No API key found" error?**
> 1. Check `.env` exists in skill folder with `export VAR=value` format
> 2. Keys auto-load from skill's `.env` since v2.2.0
> 3. Or set in system environment: `export SERPER_API_KEY="..."`

**Q: Getting empty results?**
> 1. Check API key is valid
> 2. Try a different provider with `-p`
> 3. Some queries have no results (very niche topics)

**Q: Rate limited?**
> **NEW in v2.2.5**: Automatic fallback! If one provider hits rate limits, the script automatically tries the next provider in priority order (serper → tavily → exa). You'll see fallback info in stderr and the response will include `routing.fallback_used: true`.
> 
> Provider limits: Serper 2,500 free total, Tavily 1,000/month free, Exa 1,000/month free.

### For OpenClaw Users

**Q: How do I use this in chat?**
> Just ask! OpenClaw auto-detects search intent. Or explicitly: "search with web-search-plus for..."

**Q: Does it replace built-in Brave Search?**
> No, it's complementary. Use Brave for quick lookups, web-search-plus for research/shopping/discovery.

**Q: Can I see which provider was used?**
> Yes! SOUL.md can include attribution: `[🔍 Searched with: Serper/Tavily/Exa]`
