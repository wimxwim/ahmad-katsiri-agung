# Whoop

Query health metrics from the Whoop API and generate interactive HTML charts.

## Setup (first time only)

### 1. Create a Whoop Developer App

1. Go to [developer-dashboard.whoop.com](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com)
2. Sign in with your Whoop account credentials
3. Create a Team if prompted (any name works)
4. Click **Create App** (or go to [apps/create](https://developer-dashboard.whoop.com/apps/create))
5. Fill in:
   - **App name**: anything (e.g., "Clawdbot")
   - **Scopes**: select ALL: `read:recovery`, `read:cycles`, `read:workout`, `read:sleep`, `read:profile`, `read:body_measurement`
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:9876/callback`
6. Click **Create** — you'll get a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Authenticate

Run the OAuth login flow with your credentials:

```bash
python3 scripts/whoop_auth.py login \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

This opens a browser for Whoop authorization. Log in and approve access. Tokens are stored in `~/.clawdbot/whoop-tokens.json` and auto-refresh.

Check status: `python3 scripts/whoop_auth.py status`

## Fetching Data

Use `scripts/whoop_data.py` to get JSON data:

```bash
# Sleep (last 7 days default)
python3 scripts/whoop_data.py sleep --days 14

# Recovery scores
python3 scripts/whoop_data.py recovery --days 30

# Strain/cycles
python3 scripts/whoop_data.py cycles --days 7

# Workouts
python3 scripts/whoop_data.py workouts --days 30

# Combined summary with averages
python3 scripts/whoop_data.py summary --days 7

# Custom date range
python3 scripts/whoop_data.py sleep --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-01-15

# User profile / body measurements
python3 scripts/whoop_data.py profile
python3 scripts/whoop_data.py body
```

Output is JSON to stdout. Parse it to answer user questions.

## Generating Charts

Use `scripts/whoop_chart.py` for interactive HTML visualizations:

```bash
# Sleep analysis (performance + stages)
python3 scripts/whoop_chart.py sleep --days 30

# Recovery bars (color-coded green/yellow/red)
python3 scripts/whoop_chart.py recovery --days 30

# Strain & calories trend
python3 scripts/whoop_chart.py strain --days 90

# HRV & resting heart rate trend
python3 scripts/whoop_chart.py hrv --days 90

# Full dashboard (all 4 charts)
python3 scripts/whoop_chart.py dashboard --days 30

# Save to specific file
python3 scripts/whoop_chart.py dashboard --days 90 --output ~/Desktop/whoop.html
```

Charts open automatically in the default browser. They use Chart.js with dark theme, stat cards, and tooltips.

## Answering Questions

| User asks | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "How did I sleep?" | `whoop_data.py summary --days 7`, report sleep performance + hours |
| "How's my recovery?" | `whoop_data.py recovery --days 7`, report scores + trend |
| "Show me a chart for the last month" | `whoop_chart.py dashboard --days 30` |
| "Is my HRV improving?" | `whoop_data.py recovery --days 30`, analyze trend |
| "How much did I train this week?" | `whoop_data.py workouts --days 7`, list activities |

## Key Metrics

- **Recovery** (0-100%): Green ≥67%, Yellow 34-66%, Red <34%
- **Strain** (0-21): Daily exertion score based on HR
- **Sleep Performance**: Actual sleep vs. sleep needed
- **HRV** (ms): Higher = better recovery, track trend over time
- **RHR** (bpm): Lower = better cardiovascular fitness

## Health Analysis

When the user asks about their health, trends, or wants insights, use `references/health_analysis.md` for:
- Science-backed interpretation of HRV, RHR, sleep stages, recovery, strain, SpO2
- Normal ranges by age and fitness level
- Pattern detection (day-of-week effects, sleep debt, overtraining signals)
- Actionable recommendations based on data
- Red flags that suggest medical consultation

### Analysis workflow
1. Fetch data: `python3 scripts/whoop_data.py summary --days N`
2. Read `references/health_analysis.md` for interpretation framework
3. Apply the 5-step analysis: Status → Trends → Patterns → Insights → Flags
4. Always include disclaimer that this is not medical advice
