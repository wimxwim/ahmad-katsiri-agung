# Smart Follow-ups Skill

Generate contextual follow-up suggestions for OpenClaw conversations.

## How to Trigger

Say any of these to get follow-up suggestions:

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `followups` | "followups" |
| `follow-ups` | "give me follow-ups" |
| `suggestions` | "any suggestions?" |
| `what next` | "what should I ask next?" |

> **Note:** This is a keyword the agent recognizes, not a registered `/slash` command. OpenClaw skills are guidance docs that tell the agent how to respond.

## Usage

Say "followups" in any conversation:

```
You: What is Docker?
Bot: Docker is a containerization platform...

You: /followups

Bot: 💡 What would you like to explore next?
[⚡ How do I install Docker?]
[🧠 Explain container architecture]
[🔗 Docker vs Kubernetes?]
```

**On button channels (Telegram/Discord/Slack):** Tap a button to ask that question.

**On text channels (Signal/WhatsApp/iMessage/SMS):** Reply with 1, 2, or 3.

## Categories

Each generation produces 3 suggestions:

| Category | Emoji | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Quick** | ⚡ | Clarifications, definitions, immediate next steps |
| **Deep Dive** | 🧠 | Technical depth, advanced concepts, thorough exploration |
| **Related** | 🔗 | Connected topics, broader context, alternatives |

## Authentication

**Default:** Uses OpenClaw's existing auth — same login and model as your current chat.

**Optional providers:**
- `openrouter` — Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `anthropic` — Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

## Configuration

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "smart-followups": {
      "enabled": true,
      "provider": "openclaw",
      "model": null
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | `"openclaw"` | Auth provider: `openclaw`, `openrouter`, `anthropic` |
| `model` | `null` | Model override (null = inherit from session) |
| `apiKey` | — | API key for non-openclaw providers |

## Channel Support

| Channel | Mode | Interaction |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Telegram | Buttons | Tap to ask |
| Discord | Buttons | Click to ask |
| Slack | Buttons | Click to ask |
| Signal | Text | Reply 1-3 |
| WhatsApp | Text | Reply 1-3 |
| iMessage | Text | Reply 1-3 |
| SMS | Text | Reply 1-3 |
| Matrix | Text | Reply 1-3 |
| Email | Text | Reply with number |

See [CHANNELS.md](CHANNELS.md) for detailed channel documentation.

## How It Works

1. User types `/followups`
2. Handler captures recent conversation context
3. OpenClaw generates 3 contextual questions (using current model/auth)
4. Formatted as buttons or text based on channel
5. User clicks button or replies with number
6. OpenClaw answers that question
