# SAP Analytics Cloud Test Automation

Design reusable SAC test automation as a capability-gated system: select the safest available discovery backend, require human review for profiles and baselines, then use reviewed Playwright code for deterministic execution, CI gating, reporting, and evidence.

Apply the core rule: **discovery proposes, humans approve, Playwright executes, CI enforces.**

## Related Skills

- **sap-sac-scripting**: Use for Optimized Story Experience scripting, Analytics Designer APIs, diagnostic widgets, story script behavior, and SAC MCP setup.
- **sap-sac-planning**: Use for planning models, private/public versions, data actions, multi actions, validation rules, and writeback risk analysis.
- **sap-sac-custom-widget**: Use when dashboards include owned custom widgets that need stable ARIA labels, public test hooks, lifecycle fixes, or black-box test contracts.
- **sap-dependency-security**: Use before adding source-pinned browser tools, MCP servers, CI dependencies, or executable automation that handles SAC credentials.
- **agent-browser**: Optionally load when the Vercel Labs agent-browser CLI is available and exact command syntax, snapshot/ref usage, screenshots, console, or network inspection is needed.
- **playwright**: Optionally load for CLI-based browser driving and debugging. For durable `@playwright/test` suites, use this SAC skill as the test architecture guide and follow the local project's Playwright conventions.
- **chrome-devtools**: Optionally load when Chrome DevTools MCP is installed and approved for read-only browser discovery, console/network inspection, screenshots, Lighthouse, or performance traces. Use `references/chrome-devtools-mcp.md` for SAC-safe defaults and Edge boundaries.

## Initial Guidance

When the user is starting SAC automation or has not supplied a reviewed dashboard profile, route them through `/sac-test-onboard` or follow the same intake sequence manually. Use a two-stage intake:

- Stage 1: environment class, tenant risk, allowed discovery/execution tools, auth and roles, writeback/comment scope, and baseline ownership.
- Stage 2: planning/writeback, comments, permissions, visual/data baselines, custom widgets, CI stages, and failure evidence.

Default to draft-only artifacts until the user explicitly confirms file creation and target directory. If writing is confirmed, use `profiles/<profile-id>/intake.md`, `profiles/<profile-id>/dashboard.yaml`, and `profiles/<profile-id>/scenarios/read-only-smoke.yaml` based on the bundled templates.

After a profile or scenario draft exists, route safety review to `sac-test-profile-reviewer` when available. Keep the reviewer focused on intake/profile/scenario safety, not broad Playwright suite implementation.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill to plan, implement, or review SAC automation involving:

- SAC stories, optimized stories, reports, dashboards, tabs, filters, prompts, tables, charts, exports, scripts, comments, or bookmarks.
- Dashboard profile files, scenario YAML, expected data files, visual baselines, Playwright adapters, and SAC-specific fixtures.
- Stored authentication state, SSO/MFA constraints, role-based test users, permission matrices, and CI gates.
- Planning writeback, private/public versions, data locks, validation rules, data actions, multi actions, or comment cleanup.
- Failure packets with traces, screenshots, videos, visual diffs, expected-vs-actual values, console/network summaries, and root-cause classification.

Do not use this skill as the main guide for generic web applications. Use general Playwright guidance for non-SAC sites.

## Quick Start

1. Classify the SAC story: production read-only, QA clone, planning/writeback, comments, permission-sensitive, or exploratory.
2. Establish the automation policy: allowed tenants, allowed users, auth storage handling, writeback approval, baseline approval, and CI triggers.
3. Run the capability and policy gate: choose manual discovery, Firecrawl public research, Chrome DevTools MCP with supported Chrome, Microsoft Edge/CDP, Chrome DevTools MCP with Edge best-effort, Playwright, agent-browser, or an approved enterprise browser lab based on what is installed and allowed.
4. Run read-only discovery with the selected backend: capture snapshots, annotated screenshots, console/page errors, network clues, and candidate component maps without sending private SAC content to unapproved external services.
5. Convert discovery into a human-reviewed dashboard profile: pages, widgets, locators, readiness markers, roles, data baselines, visual baselines, and known restrictions.
6. Implement deterministic Playwright tests through reusable adapters. Keep scenario files selector-free; route interactions through component IDs from the profile.
7. Gate only safe packs in CI first: auth check, read-only smoke, navigation, and critical widget readiness. Move planning, comments, data actions, visual baselines, and full permissions to controlled/nightly stages.
8. Emit reviewer-friendly failure evidence: HTML report, trace, screenshots, video, visual diff, widget metadata, expected vs actual values, and failure category.

## Operating Model

Treat AI/browser-agent output as a draft, not as the source of truth. Require human review for profile creation, selector approval, expected business values, visual/data baseline changes, permission matrices, and any destructive/writeback scenario.

Prefer profile-driven automation:

- Store tenant/story metadata, pages, components, roles, baselines, and test policies in versioned YAML/JSON.
- Implement adapters for SAC component types such as buttons, tables, charts, tabs, filters, prompts, planning tables, comments, custom widgets, exports, and bookmarks.
- Keep selectors out of scenario files. Scenarios should call component IDs and actions, while adapters resolve locators and readiness behavior.
- Start with serial execution for each dashboard. Increase parallelism only after proving isolation for auth state, tenant state, comments, planning versions, live connections, and backend capacity.

## Bundled Resources

Load these references only as needed:

- `references/architecture.md`: hybrid architecture, feasibility boundaries, reliable SAC test categories, and reusable project shape.
- `references/tool-availability-and-deployment.md`: backend decision matrix, Windows/restricted-environment checks, Firecrawl public-research policy, and no-tool fallbacks.
- `references/chrome-devtools-mcp.md`: Chrome DevTools MCP modes, SAC-safe configuration, tool categories, CLI usage, Windows/restricted deployment, and enterprise safety boundaries.
- `references/edge-cdp-enterprise.md`: installed Microsoft Edge/CDP discovery, Chrome DevTools MCP Edge patterns, profile safety, loopback-only CDP, and Windows/macOS launch checks.
- `references/dashboard-profiles-and-scenarios.md`: dashboard profile contract, scenario contract, adapter responsibilities, and onboarding flow.
- `references/agent-browser-discovery.md`: optional agent-browser read-only discovery workflow, command patterns, output artifacts, and human review checklist.
- `references/playwright-execution.md`: Playwright test runner guidance, auth, readiness, CI stages, and test category policy.
- `references/governance-and-sac-testability.md`: SAC testability contract, auth/SSO, planning/comment safety, baseline approval, and role governance.
- `references/failure-triage-and-artifacts.md`: required evidence, failure packet shape, root-cause categories, and performance/readiness metrics.
- `templates/intake.md`: guided intake packet for policy, tooling, roles, risk, baselines, and approvals.
- `templates/dashboard-profile.yaml`: starter dashboard profile with SAC metadata, readiness, components, roles, baselines, and risk policy.
- `templates/scenario-read-only-smoke.yaml`: selector-free starter smoke scenario using profile component IDs.

When implementing against a live project, also inspect the project's existing Playwright config, package manager, CI, profile schema, and artifact conventions before adding new structure.

## Common Issues

- Avoid generated SAC DOM IDs and private framework classes. Prefer visible labels, ARIA roles, text, widget metadata, profile component IDs, and reviewed fallbacks.
- Do not treat story shell load as widget readiness. Wait for page markers, critical widgets, absence of SAC error text, spinner disappearance, stable values, and retrying assertions.
- Do not automate MFA as a release dependency. Prefer stored auth state, dedicated test users, security-approved test IdP policy, or manual refresh.
- Do not run comments, planning writeback, public version publish, data actions, or multi actions against production unless there is explicit formal approval.
- Do not approve visual or data drift automatically. Require owner review, baseline reason, and pull-request evidence.
- Do not use chart pixels as the only business-value assertion. Pair chart screenshots with table/KPI/data assertions where possible.
- Do not assume agent-browser, Playwright CLI, Chrome DevTools MCP, Firecrawl MCP, public npm, browser downloads, or remote debugging are available in company environments. Use the capability gate and document fallbacks.
- Do not use Chrome DevTools MCP as the audited CI release gate. Use it for discovery/debugging; convert approved findings into profile-driven Playwright tests.
- Do not run Chrome DevTools MCP against private SAC without disabling usage statistics, update checks, and CrUX field-data lookups, and without applying profile, URL, screenshot, and network-output controls.
- Do not expose CDP beyond loopback, publish `webSocketDebuggerUrl`, attach to a daily user browser profile, or bypass Edge `RemoteDebuggingAllowed` policy.
- Do not send authenticated SAC tenant pages, screenshots, HARs, cookies, storage state, internal URLs, customer data, or private company docs to Firecrawl unless the exact deployment and retention mode are approved.
- Do not assume SAC optimized story features, tenant configuration, live data, localization, or prompt persistence behave identically across customers.

## Source and Verification Notes

Derived from incorporated SAC automated-suite planning content recorded in `docs/project/sac-test-automation-source-review-2026-06-17.md`, plus extracted profile/scenario templates bundled with this skill. The planning sources cite SAP Help, Vercel Labs agent-browser, and Playwright documentation. Edge/CDP and Chrome DevTools MCP guidance also considers the `ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp` README, CLI docs, tool reference, troubleshooting guide, package metadata, bundled skills, issue #1235 and PR #1229, Microsoft Edge DevTools Protocol documentation, Microsoft Edge DevTools MCP guidance, Edge `RemoteDebuggingAllowed` policy, and Firecrawl public documentation for MCP/search/scrape safety. This skill is docs-audited only; live SAC tenant execution, Chrome DevTools MCP runtime behavior, SSO behavior, CI behavior, planning writeback, and visual baseline stability remain tenant-specific and must be validated before making runtime claims.
