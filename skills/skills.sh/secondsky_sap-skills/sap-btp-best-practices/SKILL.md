## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when designing a BTP account model, setting up governance, choosing commercial/environment patterns, establishing security and authentication defaults, designing CI/CD and operations practices, or reviewing a BTP landscape before implementation.

## Quick Start

1. Identify the target account model: global account, directories, subaccounts, environments, and regions.
2. Choose the runtime path: Cloud Foundry, Kyma, ABAP Environment, or a hybrid portfolio.
3. Apply security defaults from [Security and Authentication](#security-and-authentication).
4. Use the relevant implementation skill for detailed execution: `sap-btp-cloud-platform`, `sap-btp-connectivity`, `sap-btp-service-manager`, `sap-cap-capire`, or `sap-fiori-tools`.
5. Record production-specific gaps in the project plan before changing `last_verified`.

Documentation-audited SAP BTP implementation guidance based on official SAP documentation. The `last_verified` date remains stale until the source refresh and any live account checks are completed.

## Platform Fundamentals

### Account Hierarchy

```
Global Account (SAP contract)
├── Directory (optional, up to 7 levels)
│   └── Subaccount (region-specific, apps run here)
│       ├── Cloud Foundry Org → Spaces
│       └── Kyma Cluster → Namespaces
└── Subaccount
```

**Key Points**:
- Global account = contract with SAP (one per commercial model)
- Directory = groups subaccounts (max 7 levels deep)
- Subaccount = deployed in specific region, enables runtimes
- Use labels for virtual grouping (Dev/Test/Prod, cost centers)

### Environments

| Environment | Use Case | Key Features |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Cloud Foundry** | Polyglot apps | Multiple buildpacks, spaces |
| **Kyma** | Cloud-native K8s | Open-source, namespaces |
| **ABAP** | ABAP extensions | RAP, cloud-ready ABAP |
| **Neo** | Legacy | **Migrate away** - HTML5, Java, HANA XS |

### Commercial Models

- **Consumption-Based** (BTPEA/CPEA): Flexible access, best for pilots
- **Subscription-Based**: Fixed-cost for known service needs

**Best Practice**: Start with consumption-based, move to subscription for stable workloads.

---

## Account Model Setup

### Simple Model (3 subaccounts)
```
Global Account
├── Dev Subaccount
├── Test Subaccount
└── Prod Subaccount
```
Best for: Initial implementations, single team, <3 projects

### Directory Model (scalable)
```
Global Account
├── Directory: HR
│   ├── hr-dev / hr-test / hr-prod
├── Directory: Sales
│   ├── sales-dev / sales-test / sales-prod
└── Directory: Central IT
    ├── api-management
    └── shared-services
```
Best for: Multiple teams, cost allocation, complex governance

### Naming Conventions

| Entity | Convention | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Subaccount | Natural language | "HR Development" |
| Subdomain | Lowercase, hyphens | `hr-dev-acme` |
| CF Org | Company prefix | `acme-hr-dev` |
| CF Space | Consistent across stages | `hr-recruiting` |

**Tip**: Derive CF org/Kyma names from subaccount names for consistency.

---

## Security and Authentication

### Identity Provider Setup

**Always use SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication**

```
Corporate IdP → Identity Authentication (proxy) → SAP BTP
```

**Critical Steps**:
1. Add multiple administrators (different time zones)
2. Enable MFA for all admins
3. Configure security alerts
4. Set up backup admins in SAP ID Service

### Authorization Methods

| Method | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Provisioning** | Production, many users | Centralized roles, automated offboarding |
| **Federation** | Simple scenarios | Real-time sync, but doesn't scale well |
| **Manual** | Testing only | Quick setup, not production-ready |

### Destination Authentication

**Recommended**:
- `PrincipalPropagation` - SAP on-premise systems
- `OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion` - Third-party systems
- `OAuth2JWTBearer` - User token exchange

**Avoid in Production**:
- `BasicAuthentication`
- `OAuth2Password`

**See**: `references/security-and-authentication.md` for complete guidance

---

## Connectivity

### Remote System Access

- **Internet Services**: Destinations with authentication
- **On-Premise Systems**: Destinations + Cloud Connector

### Cloud Connector

- Lightweight on-premise agent
- Secure tunnel to SAP BTP (no inbound ports)
- Fine-grained access control
- Supports RFC and HTTP protocols
- Enables principal propagation

**Note**: Each subaccount needs separate Cloud Connector config.

---

## Governance and Teams

### Required Teams

**Platform Engineering Team (Center of Excellence)**:
- Manages cloud landscape infrastructure
- Handles account operations, build infrastructure
- Creates governance and compliance guidelines
- **Does NOT** manage individual application lifecycles

**Cloud Development Teams**:
- Follow DevOps (develop AND operate)
- Responsible for application lifecycle
- Regular maintenance (e.g., UI updates every 6 months)

### Essential Documentation

1. **Onboarding Doc**: Organization, app IDs, timeline, tech stack
2. **Security Doc**: Data sensitivity, policies, auth framework
3. **Services Catalog**: Templates for destinations, builds, schemas

---

## Development

### Programming Models

**SAP CAP (Cloud Application Programming Model)**:
- Framework with languages, libraries, tools
- Supports Java, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Enterprise-grade services and data models

**ABAP Cloud**:
- Modern ABAP for cloud-ready apps
- RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming Model)
- Extensions for ABAP-based products

### Development Lifecycle

1. **Explore**: Business opportunity, team roles
2. **Discover**: Use cases, technology options
3. **Design**: UX design, domain-driven design
4. **Deliver**: Landscape setup, development
5. **Run and Scale**: Feedback, optimization

---

## AI Development

SAP BTP provides AI capabilities through **SAP AI Core** for:
- **Generative AI** (LLMs, RAG)
- **Narrow AI** (classical ML)

**Key Resources**:
- Repository: [SAP-samples/sap-btp-ai-best-practices](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-btp-ai-best-practices)
- Documentation: [https://btp-ai-bp.docs.sap/](https://btp-ai-bp.docs.sap/)

**Best Practices**:
- Use service keys for secure authentication
- Implement PII data masking
- Build RAG with SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine
- Configure content filtering
- Monitor model drift

**Use Cases**: 20+ samples including chatbots, PDF extraction, procurement.

**CAP + AI Integration Patterns**:
- Use SAP Cloud SDK for AI (`@sap-ai-sdk/orchestration`) inside CAP event handlers — never raw HTTP calls to LLM providers
- Bind AI Core service instance to CAP app via MTA (plan: `extended`) — credentials are managed by BTP, not in code
- Always process LLM calls asynchronously in production: return `202 Accepted`, process in background via `cds.spawn`. LLM responses can take 30-60 seconds, exceeding BTP load balancer timeouts
- Externalize prompts into JSON files or CDS entities so they can be updated without redeployment
- Use HANA Cloud `Vector(1536)` type in CDS entities for RAG scenarios with the HANA Vector Engine
- Allocate at least **512MB** memory for Node.js containers processing large text payloads with the AI SDK
- Implement resilience: validate LLM outputs before writing to the database (prevent injection attacks), cache frequent responses for cost control

**See**: `references/ai-development-best-practices.md` for patterns and examples. For CAP-specific code patterns, see **sap-cap-capire** skill. For SDK integration, see **sap-cloud-sdk-ai** skill.

### Deployment Methods

**Cloud Foundry/Neo**:
- Package as MTA archive
- Deploy via: BTP Cockpit, CF CLI, Business Application Studio

**Kyma**:
- Docker images (Dockerfile or Cloud Native Buildpacks)
- Helm charts for production
- Deploy via SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery

### CI/CD Approaches

**SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery**:
- Low expertise required
- Ready-to-use infrastructure
- Direct SAP support

**Project "Piper"**:
- High expertise required
- Jenkins-based
- Open-source community support

**Best Practice**: Combine CI/CD with SAP Cloud Transport Management for governance + agility.

**See**: `references/deployment-and-delivery.md` for detailed configs

## High Availability and Failover

### Multi-Region Architecture

```
Custom Domain URL
       │
    Load Balancer
       ├── Region 1 (active)
       └── Region 2 (passive/active)
```

### Failover Implementation

**Four Core Principles**:

1. **Deploy in Two Regions**: Near users and backend systems
2. **Keep Synced**: CI/CD pipeline or Cloud Transport Management
3. **Define Detection**: Monitor 5xx errors, timeouts
4. **Plan Failback**: Visual differentiation, user-driven

**Legal**: Check cross-region data processing restrictions.

**See**: `references/failover-and-resilience.md` for implementation details
