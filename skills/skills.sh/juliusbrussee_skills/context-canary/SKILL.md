description: Install a per-turn canary signal (e.g. starting every reply with the user's name and a turn counter) so silent context degradation becomes visible the moment it happens, and run a recovery protocol when the canary trips. Use when the user mentions a "canary", "context canary", or "canary check", asks to detect context rot / compaction / drift, says "you stopped using my name" or "did you lose context", asks "how degraded is your context", or wants an early-warning system for long agent sessions.

# Context Canary

A context canary is a trivially checkable standing instruction whose only job is to fail visibly. The classic form: "start every response with my name." The agent costs almost nothing to comply — so when the name disappears, that absence is data. The instruction didn't get harder; the agent's hold on its early-context instructions got weaker. Like the coal-mine canary, it dies first, before the failures you actually care about (forgotten constraints, ignored conventions, re-litigated decisions) start landing in your code.

This works because context degradation is **silent and gradual**. Models don't announce that they've stopped attending to instructions from 80k tokens ago, and compaction summaries quietly drop standing instructions. The canary converts an invisible failure into a binary, per-turn, zero-effort check. The research behind why this happens — context rot, lost-in-the-middle, instruction drift, compaction loss — is in **[references/research.md](references/research.md)**.

## When to use this skill

- Installing a canary at the start of a long or high-stakes session.
- The user notices the canary stopped appearing and asks what happened.
- The agent itself realizes it can no longer find its canary contract in context.
- The user asks how trustworthy the current context still is.

## The canary contract

When invoked, install the canary by stating the contract explicitly in one short message, then follow it. Default format — first line of every response from then on:

```
**Julius · t14 · ctx ok**
```

Three fields, each probing something different:

| Field | Example | What its failure means |
|---|---|---|
| Name | `Julius` | The standing instruction itself fell out of effective context — adherence drift or compaction dropped it. |
| Turn counter | `t14` | Increment by 1 every response. A reset, skip, or repeat means continuity broke — almost always compaction or a summarization boundary. |
| Self-check | `ctx ok` / `ctx aging` / `ctx thin` | The agent's honest estimate. `aging`: the session is long and early details are getting summarized in its own working sense of the task. `thin`: the agent is reconstructing earlier decisions instead of remembering them. |

Use the user's actual name (ask if unknown). If the user wants the minimal version, name-only is fine — it's the original trick and still catches the big failures. Never explain, apologize for, or decorate the canary line; it must stay byte-stable so a human can pattern-match it in half a second.

**Session canary vs. standing canary.** A canary that lives only in the conversation tests whether *conversation* context survives (compaction, truncation, drift). A canary written into `CLAUDE.md` or agent memory survives compaction by design — which means it tests whether file-based instructions are being attended to, a different and weaker signal. Default to the session canary; that's the one that detects degradation. Offer the standing variant only if the user wants the habit across all sessions, and tell them what it no longer measures.

## Emission rules

1. Canary is the **first line** of every response, including short ones, error reports, and responses after tool calls.
2. Increment the counter every response. If unsure of the count, that uncertainty IS a signal — emit `t?` and flag it, never guess a plausible number.
3. The self-check must be honest. Reporting `ctx ok` by reflex defeats the entire instrument.
4. If at any point the canary contract cannot be found in context (you only know about it from a summary, or not at all), **declare a trip yourself** — don't wait for the user to notice.

## Trip protocol

A trip is: the canary missing, malformed, a counter discontinuity, or an agent-side self-declaration.

Calibrate before alarming — one missed canary on an otherwise coherent response is a warning (note it, resume the canary, keep going). **Two consecutive misses, a counter discontinuity, or the agent failing its own contract check is a confirmed trip.** Then:

1. **Stop trusting drifted state.** Do not barrel ahead on the current task using context you can no longer vouch for.
2. **Checkpoint.** Write the durable state somewhere outside the conversation: current goal, decisions made and why, files touched, what's verified vs. in-progress, next step. A `HANDOFF.md` or notes file in the repo works.
3. **Re-anchor.** Re-read the project instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, the original task statement) and the checkpoint. State back to the user, in three or four lines, what you believe the task and constraints are — so they can correct any drift cheaply.
4. **Reset deliberately.** Recommend the user start a fresh session (or run an explicit compact) seeded with the checkpoint file, rather than limping on. Degraded context doesn't heal; it compounds.
5. **Re-install the canary** with the counter reset to `t1`, noting the generation: `t1 (gen 2)`.

Never silently resume the canary after a gap as if nothing happened — that destroys the instrument's credibility, which is all it has.

## What the canary does and doesn't tell you

The test is one-sided. A **missing** canary is strong evidence of degradation. A **present** canary is weak evidence of health — a cheap stylistic habit can survive while harder constraints (architecture decisions, "never touch X") quietly rot, and a canary stuffed into memory files can outlive the context it was meant to monitor. Treat the canary as a smoke detector, not a structural inspection: when it fires, act; when it's quiet, stay reasonably suspicious in sessions past roughly 50% of the context window or after any compaction event.

Pair it with the cheap structural habits that reduce what the canary has to catch: keep durable decisions in files instead of chat, compact at deliberate boundaries instead of waiting for forced compaction, and prefer fresh sessions per task over one immortal session.
