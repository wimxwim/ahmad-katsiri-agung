## Overview

DigitalOcean storage includes S3-compatible object storage, network-attached block storage, managed NFS, plus snapshots and backups for recovery workflows.

## Spaces Object Storage

Use Spaces for large datasets, static assets, and logs.

- Create a Space in the required region.
- Generate access keys for S3-compatible tooling.
- Configure access controls for public or private objects.

## Volumes Block Storage

Use Volumes to add persistent block storage to Droplets.

- Create a Volume in the same region as the Droplet.
- Attach the Volume to a Droplet.
- Mount the Volume on the Droplet OS.

## NFS File Storage

Use managed NFS for shared file access across services.

- Provision an NFS file system.
- Mount from compute resources that require shared storage.

## Snapshots

Use snapshots for on-demand backups of Droplets or Volumes.

- Create snapshots before major changes.
- Use snapshots to create new Droplets or Volumes.

## Backups

Use scheduled backups for routine recovery points.

- Enable backups on Droplets.
- Restore from backups during recovery.

## Storage Selection Guide

- Use **Spaces** for object storage and static assets.
- Use **Volumes** for persistent block storage on Droplets.
- Use **NFS** for shared POSIX file storage.
- Use **Snapshots** for point-in-time recovery.
- Use **Backups** for scheduled system-level protection.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **digitalocean-compute**: Droplets and App Platform storage attachment.
- **digitalocean-containers-images**: Image and registry workflows.
- **digitalocean-managed-databases**: Data backups and migration planning.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
