## Overview

DigitalOcean provides a private Container Registry plus tools for managing Droplet images and snapshots.

## Container Registry

Use Container Registry to store private container images.

- Create a registry in the target region.
- Authenticate build systems to push images.
- Configure App Platform or Kubernetes to pull from the registry.

## Containers and Images

Use preconfigured images to create Droplets quickly.

- Select official or marketplace images when creating Droplets.
- Use snapshots to capture a configured Droplet as a reusable image.

## Custom Images

Use custom images to boot Droplets with preinstalled stacks.

- Upload a custom image that meets DigitalOcean requirements.
- Use the custom image as the base for new Droplets.

## Image Lifecycle Practices

- Standardize base images for consistency.
- Use snapshots to version and roll back Droplet states.
- Store container images in the registry alongside source commits.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **digitalocean-compute**: Droplets, App Platform, and Kubernetes compute selection.
- **digitalocean-storage**: Snapshots and backups.
- **docker**: Container build and runtime patterns.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
