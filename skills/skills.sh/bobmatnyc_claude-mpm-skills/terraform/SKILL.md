# Terraform

## Quick Start (workflow)

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

## Safety Checklist

- State: remote backend + locking; separate state per environment
- Reviews: plan in CI; apply from a trusted runner with approvals
- Guardrails: `prevent_destroy` and policy checks for prod
