## Overview

DigitalOcean Gradient AI provides managed infrastructure for building and deploying AI agents. Use Agentic Cloud for end-to-end agent workflows and the AI Platform for GPU-powered agent deployment.

## Gradient AI Agentic Cloud

- Build, train, and deploy AI agents on managed infrastructure.
- Use managed resources to run agent workloads without manual GPU orchestration.

## Gradient AI Platform

- Use GPU-powered infrastructure for AI agents and inference.
- Combine foundation models with knowledge bases.
- Configure agent routes to direct traffic and workflows.

## Agent Workflow

- Select the target model and compute profile.
- Prepare datasets and knowledge bases.
- Define agent routes and inference behavior.
- Deploy agents and observe runtime metrics.

## Integration Considerations

- Use object or block storage for datasets and artifacts.
- Align deployment with VPC and access controls.
- Track costs and usage in projects.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **digitalocean-storage**: Spaces, Volumes, and NFS for datasets.
- **digitalocean-compute**: GPU Droplets or Kubernetes for adjacent workloads.
- **digitalocean-management**: Monitoring and project organization.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
