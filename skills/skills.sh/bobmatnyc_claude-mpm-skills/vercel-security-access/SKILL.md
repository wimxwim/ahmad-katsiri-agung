## Overview

Vercel security features cover identity, access control, deployment protection, and threat mitigation.

## Access Control

- Use RBAC to define project permissions.
- Configure SAML or OIDC for SSO.
- Require 2FA for sensitive access.

## Deployment Protection

- Apply deployment protection for previews and production.
- Limit access to protected deployments.

## Firewall and Bot Defense

- Use Vercel Firewall to manage traffic rules.
- Use BotID to mitigate automated abuse.

## Audit and Activity Logs

- Review audit logs for compliance.
- Track activity history for user actions.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **vercel-teams-billing**: Team settings and account policy.
- **vercel-observability**: Operational visibility for security events.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
