## Overview

DigitalOcean provides cloud services for compute, storage, networking, and managed databases, plus monitoring and team management. Use the Control Panel, doctl CLI, REST API, or Terraform for provisioning and operations.

## Platform Entry Points

- **Control Panel**: Use the web UI for interactive provisioning and monitoring.
- **doctl CLI**: Automate resource creation and lifecycle management.
- **REST API**: Integrate provisioning into internal tooling.
- **Terraform**: Manage infrastructure as code.

## Account and Access Setup

- Create a team and configure billing and access.
- Enable account security settings (2FA and secure sign-in).
- Add SSH keys for Droplet access.
- Create API tokens for automation and CI/CD.

## Project Organization

- Use Projects to group resources by application, environment, or team.
- Standardize naming to simplify search and ownership.

## DigitalOcean Skill Map

Use these skills for deeper coverage (if deployed):

- **digitalocean-compute**: Droplets, App Platform, Functions, Kubernetes, GPU.
- **digitalocean-agentic-cloud**: Gradient AI agentic cloud and AI platform.
- **digitalocean-storage**: Spaces, Volumes, NFS, Snapshots, Backups.
- **digitalocean-containers-images**: Container Registry, custom images, image lifecycle.
- **digitalocean-managed-databases**: Managed Postgres, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka, OpenSearch, Valkey.
- **digitalocean-networking**: VPC, firewalls, load balancers, DNS, reserved IPs.
- **digitalocean-management**: Monitoring, uptime checks, projects.
- **digitalocean-teams**: Teams, organizations, roles, access controls.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **kubernetes**: Cluster operations and troubleshooting patterns.
- **docker**: Container build and runtime fundamentals.
- **terraform**: Infrastructure as code workflows.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
