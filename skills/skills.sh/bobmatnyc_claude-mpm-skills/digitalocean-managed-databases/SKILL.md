## Overview

DigitalOcean Managed Databases provide fully managed clusters so teams can avoid manual setup and maintenance.

**Supported engines**:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Kafka
- OpenSearch
- Valkey

## Provisioning Workflow

- Select engine, region, and cluster size.
- Create users and databases with required roles.
- Configure trusted sources and VPC networking.
- Retrieve connection strings and TLS settings.

## Operations and Scaling

- Scale nodes or storage as demand grows.
- Set maintenance windows to control upgrades.
- Review backups and restore points.

## Security Practices

- Use VPC for private connectivity.
- Rotate credentials and limit user privileges.
- Enforce TLS connections.

## Migration Planning

- Use engine-specific migration guides.
- Validate application connectivity before cutover.
- Plan rollback using snapshots or backups.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **digitalocean-networking**: VPC, firewalls, and private access.
- **digitalocean-management**: Monitoring and alerting.
- **digitalocean-storage**: Backup and snapshot workflows.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
