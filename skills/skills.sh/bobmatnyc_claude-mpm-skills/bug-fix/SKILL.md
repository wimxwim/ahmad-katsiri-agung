# Bug Fix Verification

Systematic workflow for verifying bug fixes to ensure quality and prevent regressions.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Fixing a reported bug
- Creating PR for bug fix
- Need to document bug fix verification
- Want to ensure fix doesn't introduce regressions
- Need structured approach to bug resolution

## Why Bug Fix Verification Matters

### Problems It Solves
- ❌ Fixing symptoms instead of root cause
- ❌ Introducing new bugs while fixing old ones
- ❌ Incomplete testing of edge cases
- ❌ No proof that bug is actually fixed
- ❌ Poor documentation of fix reasoning

### Benefits
- ✅ Confirms bug is truly fixed (not masked)
- ✅ Documents root cause analysis
- ✅ Prevents regression with tests
- ✅ Provides clear evidence for stakeholders
- ✅ Improves team knowledge of codebase

## Bug Fix Workflow

### Step 1: Reproduce Before Fix

**Critical**: Never fix a bug without first reproducing it.

#### Reproduction Checklist
- [ ] Document exact steps to reproduce
- [ ] Capture error message/behavior with screenshots
- [ ] Note frequency (100% reproducible, intermittent, etc.)
- [ ] Video recording if UI-related or complex interaction
- [ ] Identify affected versions/environments
- [ ] Note any workarounds users have found
- [ ] Verify bug exists in clean environment (not just local)

#### Reproduction Documentation Template
```markdown
## Bug Reproduction

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. Click "Export Data" button
3. Select date range: Jan 1 - Dec 31
4. Click "Generate Report"

### Expected Behavior
- Report downloads as CSV file
- File contains all transactions for date range
- Download completes in < 5 seconds

### Actual Behavior
- Error appears: "Failed to generate report"
- Console error: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined`
- No file downloads
- Issue occurs 100% of the time

### Environment
- Browser: Chrome 120.0.6099.109
- OS: macOS 14.2
- User Role: Admin
- Data Size: ~10,000 transactions

### Screenshots

![Console error](screenshots/console-error.png)
```

### Step 2: Root Cause Analysis

Investigate WHY the bug occurs, not just WHAT happens.

#### Investigation Steps
1. **Review Error Logs**: Check server logs, browser console, error tracking
2. **Trace Code Path**: Follow execution from trigger point to error
3. **Identify Breaking Point**: Find exact line/function where bug occurs
4. **Understand Context**: Why does code behave this way?
5. **Check Recent Changes**: Did recent commit introduce this?
6. **Review Related Code**: Are there similar patterns elsewhere?

#### Root Cause Documentation
```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation
- Error occurs in `generateReport()` function at line 45
- Function assumes `transactions` array always exists
- When date range returns no results, backend returns `null`
- Frontend doesn't handle `null` case, tries to call `.map()` on `null`

### Root Cause
- Missing null check before array operations
- Backend API doesn't return consistent data structure (sometimes `[]`, sometimes `null`)
- No validation of API response shape

### Why This Wasn't Caught
- Unit tests only covered happy path (data exists)
- Integration tests didn't test empty result scenario
- Backend inconsistency not documented in API contract
```

### Step 3: Implement Fix

Fix the root cause, not the symptom.

#### Fix Guidelines
- **Minimal Change**: Fix only what's necessary
- **Defensive Coding**: Add validation/guards
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow existing error handling patterns
- **Type Safety**: Use types to prevent similar bugs
- **Documentation**: Comment non-obvious fixes

#### Example Fix
```typescript
// BEFORE (Bug)
function generateReport(transactions) {
  return transactions.map(t => ({
    date: t.date,
    amount: t.amount,
  }));
}

// AFTER (Fixed)
function generateReport(transactions) {
  // Guard against null/undefined from backend
  if (!transactions || !Array.isArray(transactions)) {
    console.warn('No transactions to export');
    return [];
  }

  return transactions.map(t => ({
    date: t.date,
    amount: t.amount,
  }));
}
```

### Step 4: Verify Fix

Prove the bug is fixed through systematic testing.

#### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Follow same reproduction steps
- [ ] Confirm bug no longer occurs
- [ ] Test edge cases around the fix
- [ ] Verify no new errors introduced
- [ ] Check fix works across environments (dev, staging)
- [ ] Validate fix matches expected behavior

#### Verification Documentation
```markdown
## Fix Verification

### Testing Performed
1. ✅ Followed original reproduction steps - bug no longer occurs
2. ✅ Tested with empty date range - shows "No data to export" message
3. ✅ Tested with valid date range - exports successfully
4. ✅ Tested with large dataset (50k+ transactions) - works correctly
5. ✅ Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari - all working
6. ✅ Tested on staging environment - fix confirmed

### Edge Cases Tested
- Empty result set → Shows appropriate message
- Null response from API → Handled gracefully
- Single transaction → Exports correctly
- Malformed transaction data → Logs error, doesn't crash

### No New Issues
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Other export features still work
```

### Step 5: Add Tests to Prevent Regression

**Critical**: Every bug fix must include tests.

#### Test Requirements
- [ ] Test that reproduces original bug (should pass after fix)
- [ ] Tests for edge cases discovered during investigation
- [ ] Integration test if bug involved multiple components
- [ ] Update existing tests if they need to handle new scenarios

#### Example Tests
```typescript
describe('generateReport', () => {
  // Test that reproduces original bug
  it('should handle null transactions gracefully', () => {
    const result = generateReport(null);
    expect(result).toEqual([]);
    expect(console.warn).toHaveBeenCalledWith('No transactions to export');
  });

  // Edge cases
  it('should handle undefined transactions', () => {
    const result = generateReport(undefined);
    expect(result).toEqual([]);
  });

  it('should handle empty array', () => {
    const result = generateReport([]);
    expect(result).toEqual([]);
  });

  it('should handle single transaction', () => {
    const transactions = [{ date: '2025-01-01', amount: 100 }];
    const result = generateReport(transactions);
    expect(result).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(result[0]).toEqual({ date: '2025-01-01', amount: 100 });
  });

  // Original happy path (should still work)
  it('should transform multiple transactions correctly', () => {
    const transactions = [
      { date: '2025-01-01', amount: 100 },
      { date: '2025-01-02', amount: 200 },
    ];
    const result = generateReport(transactions);
    expect(result).toHaveLength(2);
  });
});
```

### Step 6: Document in PR

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### During Investigation
- ❌ Assuming you know the cause without verifying
- ❌ Fixing symptoms instead of root cause
- ❌ Not checking if similar bugs exist elsewhere
- ❌ Skipping reproduction in clean environment

### During Implementation
- ❌ Making changes beyond fixing the bug
- ❌ Refactoring unrelated code in bug fix PR
- ❌ Adding features while fixing bugs
- ❌ Not handling all edge cases discovered

### During Verification
- ❌ Only testing happy path after fix
- ❌ Not testing in multiple environments
- ❌ Skipping regression testing
- ❌ Not documenting what was tested

### During Documentation
- ❌ Vague PR descriptions ("Fixed bug")
- ❌ Not explaining root cause
- ❌ Missing before/after evidence
- ❌ Not linking to original bug report

## Bug Fix Quality Standards

### Minimum Requirements
- ✅ Root cause identified and documented
- ✅ Fix is minimal and targeted
- ✅ Tests added to prevent regression
