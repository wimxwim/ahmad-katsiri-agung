## Overview

Vercel AI capabilities include SDKs and services for building AI-enabled applications, model routing, and agent workflows.

## AI SDK

- Use the AI SDK to build AI-driven app features.

## AI Gateway

- Route model traffic through AI Gateway.
- Apply usage controls and monitoring.

## Vercel Agent

- Build and operate agentic workflows.
- Connect agent integrations as needed.

## MCP

- Use MCP integrations for AI tooling and workflows.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **vercel-functions-runtime**: Functions and Edge execution for AI workloads.
- **vercel-storage-data**: Data stores for embeddings and artifacts.
- **vercel-observability**: Usage monitoring and debugging.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
