## Overview

Vercel Functions provide serverless execution for APIs and background tasks. The Edge Runtime enables low-latency execution closer to users.

## Vercel Functions

- Define serverless functions in the project structure.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Review logs for errors and performance.

## Edge Runtime

- Use the Edge Runtime for low-latency execution.
- Validate compatibility with the Edge runtime constraints.

## Cron Jobs

- Schedule jobs with cron definitions.
- Use cron for periodic maintenance tasks or sync jobs.

## Routing and Middleware

- Apply routing middleware for request handling.
- Use headers, rewrites, and redirects to control traffic.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **vercel-deployments-builds**: Deployment workflow and release controls.
- **vercel-networking-domains**: Routing, headers, and edge caching.
- **vercel-observability**: Logs and tracing for function debugging.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
