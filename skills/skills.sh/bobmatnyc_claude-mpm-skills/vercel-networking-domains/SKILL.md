## Overview

Vercel networking covers domain configuration, routing rules, and edge delivery behavior through the CDN and edge cache.

## Domains and DNS

- Add domains and verify ownership.
- Configure DNS records for routing.

## Routing Rules

- Define redirects and rewrites for URL behavior.
- Apply custom headers and compression.

## CDN and Edge Cache

- Use CDN distribution for global delivery.
- Purge or invalidate edge cache when needed.

## Regions

- Select regions for deployment and execution.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **vercel-functions-runtime**: Function routing and edge execution.
- **vercel-deployments-builds**: Deployment workflow and releases.
- **vercel-observability**: Traffic analytics and performance metrics.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
