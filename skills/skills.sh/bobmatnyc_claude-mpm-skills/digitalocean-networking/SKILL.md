## Overview

DigitalOcean networking services secure and control traffic with VPC networking, firewalls, load balancing, DNS, IPv6, and reserved IPs.

## VPC

Use VPC to create private network segments for Droplets, Kubernetes, and managed databases.

- Create a VPC in the same region as compute resources.
- Attach resources that need private communication.

## Firewalls

Use stateful firewalls to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.

- Define inbound and outbound rules by protocol and port.
- Apply rules to Droplets and other resources.

## Load Balancers

Use load balancers to distribute traffic across backend resources.

- Configure health checks and target pools.
- Terminate TLS and forward to backend services.

## Reserved IPs

Use reserved IPs to keep stable public endpoints.

- Assign reserved IPs to Droplets.
- Remap IPs during failover or migration.

## DNS and IPv6

- Manage DNS records for DigitalOcean and external resources.
- Enable IPv6 for dual-stack support.

## NAT Gateway

Use NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity from private subnets.

## Networking Workflow

- Create a VPC per environment.
- Attach compute and databases to the VPC.
- Apply firewalls to limit inbound access.
- Add load balancers for public entry points.
- Configure DNS and reserved IPs for stable routing.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **digitalocean-compute**: Droplets, App Platform, and Kubernetes placement.
- **digitalocean-managed-databases**: Private database connectivity.
- **digitalocean-management**: Monitoring and uptime checks.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
