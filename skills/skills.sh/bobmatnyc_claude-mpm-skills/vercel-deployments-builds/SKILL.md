## Overview

Vercel deployments and builds cover the full lifecycle from source changes to production releases with automated previews and rollback controls.

## Deployments

- Use preview deployments for every branch or pull request.
- Promote deployments to production when ready.
- Configure deployment retention where needed.

## Builds

- Define build settings per project.
- Use the Build Output API for custom build output.
- Review build logs for failures.

## Release Controls

- Use release phases for controlled rollouts.
- Use instant rollback when a deployment causes regressions.
- Add deployment checks for quality gates.

## Automation

- Trigger deployments with deploy hooks.
- Add a deploy button for fast deploys.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **vercel-functions-runtime**: Functions and runtime behavior for deployments.
- **vercel-networking-domains**: Domains, routing, and CDN behavior.
- **vercel-observability**: Logs and tracing for deployment issues.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
