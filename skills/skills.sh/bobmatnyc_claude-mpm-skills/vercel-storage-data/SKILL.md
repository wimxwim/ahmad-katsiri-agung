## Overview

Vercel provides managed data services and storage for application state, cache, and files.

## Postgres

- Provision Postgres for relational data.
- Manage credentials and connection strings.

## Redis

- Use Redis for caching and ephemeral state.
- Configure access for Functions and Edge workloads.

## Vercel Blob

- Store and serve files with Vercel Blob.
- Use Blob for uploads, assets, and media storage.

## Edge Config

- Use Edge Config for low-latency configuration and feature data.
- Read from Edge Runtime workloads.

## Data Cache and Storage

- Use data cache features for response caching.
- Review storage options for app data.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **vercel-functions-runtime**: Functions and Edge access to data.
- **vercel-networking-domains**: Edge caching and routing.
- **vercel-observability**: Usage and performance monitoring.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
