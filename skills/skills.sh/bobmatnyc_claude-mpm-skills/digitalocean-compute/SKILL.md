## Overview

DigitalOcean compute includes VMs, managed PaaS, serverless functions, and managed Kubernetes, plus GPU offerings for AI workloads.

## Droplets (VMs)

Use Droplets for full OS control and custom networking.

- Choose region and Droplet plan.
- Select an OS image or snapshot.
- Add SSH keys for secure access.
- Attach Volumes for persistent block storage.
- Apply firewalls and VPC configuration.

## App Platform (PaaS)

Use App Platform to deploy from Git or container images with managed build and runtime.

- Connect a Git repository or container registry.
- Define build and run commands or app spec.
- Set environment variables and secrets.
- Configure custom domains and HTTPS.

## Functions (FaaS)

Use Functions for event-driven or lightweight API workloads.

- Create a Functions namespace.
- Deploy functions with doctl or the Control Panel.
- Configure environment variables and triggers.
- Monitor execution and logs.

## Kubernetes (DOKS)

Use managed Kubernetes for multi-service container orchestration.

- Create a cluster and node pools.
- Save kubeconfig for cluster access.
- Deploy workloads with Kubernetes manifests.
- Pull images from Container Registry.

## GPU Compute

Use GPU Droplets or Bare Metal GPUs for AI and ML workloads.

- GPU Droplets: VM-based GPU workloads with flexible sizing.
- Bare Metal GPUs: Dedicated GPU hardware for high performance.

## Compute Selection Guide

- Use **Droplets** for full control and custom configurations.
- Use **App Platform** for managed app deployments from Git or containers.
- Use **Functions** for event-driven workflows and micro APIs.
- Use **Kubernetes** for multi-service container orchestration.
- Use **GPU Droplets** or **Bare Metal GPUs** for AI or GPU-heavy workloads.

## Complementary Skills

When using this skill, consider these related skills (if deployed):

- **digitalocean-containers-images**: Registry and image workflows.
- **digitalocean-storage**: Spaces, Volumes, and backups.
- **kubernetes**: Cluster operations and troubleshooting.
- **docker**: Container build and runtime patterns.

*Note: Complementary skills are optional. This skill is fully functional without them.*
