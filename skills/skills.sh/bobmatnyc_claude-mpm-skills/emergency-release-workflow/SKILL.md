# Emergency Release Workflow Skill

## Summary
Fast-track workflow for critical production issues requiring immediate deployment. Covers urgency assessment, expedited PR process, deployment verification, and post-incident analysis.

## When to Use
- Critical production bugs affecting users
- Security vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Urgent business requirements
- Data integrity issues
- Service outages
- Payment processing failures

## Urgency Assessment

### Priority Levels
| Level | Type | Response Time | Deployment | Example |
|-------|------|---------------|------------|---------|
| **P0** | Security vulnerability | < 2 hours | Immediate to production | Auth bypass, data leak, active exploit |
| **P1** | Production down | < 4 hours | Same day | App crash, complete feature failure, payment down |
| **P2** | Major bug | < 24 hours | Next business day | Critical feature broken, significant user impact |
| **P3** | Business critical | < 48 hours | Scheduled release | Marketing campaign blocker, partner deadline |

### P0 Criteria (Immediate Action)
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Data breach or exposure
- Remote code execution vulnerability
- Production service completely unavailable
- Data corruption affecting multiple users
- Payment processing completely broken

### P1 Criteria (Same Day)
- Critical feature completely broken
- Error affecting majority of users
- Revenue-impacting bug
- Database connectivity issues
- Third-party integration failure (critical service)

### P2 Criteria (Next Business Day)
- Major feature partially broken
- Affects specific user segment
- Workaround available but not ideal
- Performance degradation (not complete failure)

---

## Emergency Release Process

### 1. Create Hotfix Branch
```bash
# Branch from current production (main)
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/ENG-XXX-brief-description

# Example:
git checkout -b hotfix/ENG-1234-fix-auth-bypass
```

### 2. Implement Minimal Fix
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Minimal change only

DO:
✅ Fix the immediate issue
✅ Add regression test
✅ Document root cause in comments

DON'T:
❌ Refactor surrounding code
❌ Fix unrelated issues
❌ Add new features
❌ Update dependencies (unless that's the fix)
```

### 3. Test Thoroughly
```bash
# Run full test suite
pnpm test

# Type check
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Build verification
pnpm build

# Manual testing checklist:
# - [ ] Reproduce original issue
# - [ ] Verify fix resolves issue
# - [ ] Test happy path
# - [ ] Test edge cases
# - [ ] Verify no new issues introduced
```

### 4. Create PR with Labels
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: [brief description of fix]

Fixes critical issue where [description].
Root cause: [explanation].

Ticket: ENG-XXX
Priority: P0"

git push origin hotfix/ENG-XXX-brief-description
```

**Use clear labels in PR title:**
- `[RELEASE]` - Direct to production
- `[HOTFIX]` - Critical fix, expedited review
- `[P0]` or `[P1]` - Priority indicator

---

### Testing
- [ ] ✅ Reproduced issue locally
- [ ] ✅ Verified fix resolves issue
- [ ] ✅ Regression test added
- [ ] ✅ No other functionality affected
- [ ] ✅ Tested edge cases
- [ ] ✅ Deployed to staging and verified

### Regression Test
```typescript
// Test added to prevent recurrence
describe('ENG-XXX: Auth bypass fix', () => {
  it('should reject expired tokens', async () => {
    const expiredToken = generateExpiredToken();
    const response = await fetch('/api/protected', {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${expiredToken}` }
    });
    expect(response.status).toBe(401);
  });
});
```

### Rollback Plan
**If this causes issues:**

```bash
# Option 1: Revert commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Option 2: Deploy previous version
vercel rollback  # or your platform's rollback command

# Option 3: Feature flag
Set FEATURE_FIX_XXX=false in environment
```

**Monitoring:**
- [ ] Error rate in Sentry
- [ ] API response times in monitoring dashboard
- [ ] User reports in support channels

### Deploy Checklist
- [ ] PR approved by at least one reviewer (waive for P0 if necessary)
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] Deployed to staging and verified
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] On-call engineer notified
- [ ] Ready for production deployment

### Post-Deploy Verification
**Immediately after deploy:**
- [ ] Verify fix in production (test endpoint directly)
- [ ] Check error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Monitor for new errors
- [ ] Confirm user reports stop coming in

**Metrics to watch:**
- Error rate (should drop)
- API latency (should remain stable)
- User activity (should normalize)

### Follow-Up
- [ ] Update Linear ticket with resolution
- [ ] Schedule post-incident review (if P0/P1)
- [ ] Create tickets for proper fix (if this was a band-aid)
- [ ] Update runbook/documentation
```

git log -1
# Confirm this is your hotfix commit

# 4. Tag release (if using semantic versioning)
git tag -a v2.3.5 -m "Hotfix: Fix auth bypass vulnerability"
git push origin v2.3.5
```

### Deployment (Platform-Specific)

#### Vercel
```bash
# Trigger production deployment
vercel --prod

# Or use Vercel dashboard:
# Deployments → Select commit → Deploy to Production

# Monitor deployment
vercel logs --follow
```

#### Netlify
```bash
# Deploy via CLI
netlify deploy --prod

# Or trigger from dashboard:

## Backport Strategy

When fix needs to go to multiple branches/environments:

### Multiple Environment Deployment
```bash
# 1. Fix applied to main (production)
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-hash>

# 2. Backport to release candidate
git checkout release-candidate
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-hash>
git push origin release-candidate

# 3. Backport to develop
git checkout develop
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-hash>
git push origin develop

# Create PRs for each backport:
gh pr create --base release-candidate --head backport/rc/hotfix-ENG-XXX
gh pr create --base develop --head backport/dev/hotfix-ENG-XXX
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts
```bash
# If cherry-pick fails due to conflicts
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-hash>
# CONFLICT in file.ts

# Resolve conflicts manually
# Then:
git add file.ts
git cherry-pick --continue
```

### Alternative: Patch File
```bash
# Create patch from hotfix
git format-patch -1 <hotfix-commit-hash>
# Creates: 0001-fix-auth-bypass.patch

# Apply to other branch
git checkout release-candidate
git apply 0001-fix-auth-bypass.patch
```

## Summary

### Emergency Release Quick Reference

#### Decision Tree
```
Is production broken?
├─ Yes → Severity level?
│  ├─ P0 (security/down) → Deploy immediately, inform after
│  ├─ P1 (critical bug) → Fast-track PR, deploy same day
│  └─ P2 (major bug) → Standard expedited process
└─ No → Use normal deployment process
```

#### Time Targets
- **P0**: Issue → Deploy in < 2 hours
- **P1**: Issue → Deploy in < 4 hours
- **P2**: Issue → Deploy in < 24 hours

#### Key Principles
1. **Minimal Change**: Fix only the immediate issue
2. **Add Regression Test**: Prevent recurrence
3. **Fast Feedback**: Deploy to staging first (except P0)
4. **Clear Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed
5. **Learn & Improve**: Conduct PIR for P0/P1

#### Checklist
- [ ] Assess urgency correctly
- [ ] Create hotfix branch from production
- [ ] Implement minimal fix with regression test
- [ ] Use appropriate PR labels
- [ ] Test thoroughly (staging for P1/P2)
- [ ] Get approval (or waive for P0)
- [ ] Deploy with monitoring
- [ ] Verify fix in production
- [ ] Communicate status
- [ ] Schedule PIR (P0/P1)
- [ ] Create follow-up tickets

Use this skill when production issues require immediate attention and fast-track deployment outside normal release processes.
