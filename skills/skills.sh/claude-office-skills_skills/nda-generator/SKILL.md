## Overview

I help you create professional Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) for various business situations. Whether you're meeting potential investors, hiring contractors, or exploring partnerships, I'll generate an appropriate NDA.

**What I can do:**
- Generate one-way or mutual NDAs
- Customize confidentiality scope and duration
- Include standard protective clauses
- Adapt for different jurisdictions
- Support English and Chinese

**What I cannot do:**
- Provide legal advice
- Guarantee enforceability in your jurisdiction
- Replace review by a qualified attorney for high-stakes situations

## How to Use Me

### Step 1: Tell Me the Situation
- **What's the context?** (investor meeting, contractor, partnership, employment)
- **Who are the parties?** (names and roles)
- **What information needs protection?** (technical, business, financial)
- **One-way or mutual?** (who's sharing confidential info)

### Step 2: I'll Generate
A complete NDA with:
- Proper definitions
- Confidentiality obligations
- Standard exclusions
- Duration and termination
- Governing law

### Step 3: Customize
Tell me if you need:
- Specific duration
- Additional protected categories
- Return/destruction requirements
- Specific jurisdiction

---

## NDA Types

### One-Way (Unilateral)

**When to use:** You're sharing confidential information, but the other party isn't.

**Examples:**
- Pitching to investors
- Hiring employees/contractors
- Sharing with potential vendors

**Key feature:** Only one party (Discloser) is protected.

### Mutual (Bilateral)

**When to use:** Both parties will share confidential information.

**Examples:**
- Partnership discussions
- M&A negotiations
- Joint venture exploration
- Technical collaboration

**Key feature:** Both parties are bound to protect each other's information.

---

## Key Clauses Explained

### 1. Definition of Confidential Information

**Purpose:** Define what's protected

**Standard scope includes:**
- Technical information (designs, code, algorithms)
- Business information (strategies, financials, customers)
- Trade secrets
- Anything marked "Confidential"

**Exclusions (standard):**
- Already publicly known
- Already known to recipient
- Independently developed
- Received from third party without restriction
- Required by law to disclose

### 2. Confidentiality Obligations

**Core obligations:**
- Keep information confidential
- Use only for stated purpose
- Limit access to "need to know" personnel
- Protect with reasonable care

**Standard of care options:**
| Level | Language | When to use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Basic | "Reasonable care" | Most situations |
| Enhanced | "Same care as own confidential info" | Sensitive business info |
| High | "Highest degree of care" | Trade secrets, critical IP |

### 3. Duration

**Two timeframes to consider:**

1. **Agreement term** - How long the NDA is in effect
   - Typically 1-3 years
   - Or "until purpose is complete"

2. **Confidentiality period** - How long info stays confidential
   - Trade secrets: "As long as they remain trade secrets"
   - Other info: 2-5 years is common

### 4. Return/Destruction

**At termination, recipient must:**
- Return all confidential materials
- Destroy all copies
- Certify destruction in writing (optional)

**Exception:** May retain copies required by law or for legal compliance

### 5. Remedies

**Standard remedies:**
- Injunctive relief (courts can stop disclosure)
- Damages for breach
- Attorney's fees (optional)

**Key provisions:**
- Work product assignment (often combined)
- Non-solicitation (if allowed in jurisdiction)

## Jurisdiction Notes

### United States

- State law governs (choose carefully)
- Non-competes often in separate agreement
- Trade secrets protected under DTSA (federal) + state laws

**Common choices:**
| State | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Delaware | Business-friendly, well-developed law |
| New York | Major commercial center |
| California | Employee-friendly, non-competes void |

### European Union

- GDPR considerations if personal data involved
- Some countries require specific language
- Enforcement varies by country

### China

- Enforcement improving but varies by region
- Often combined with non-compete agreements
- Consider bilingual version for cross-border deals
- Local notarization may strengthen enforceability

### United Kingdom

- Common law applies
- Reasonable duration required
- Garden leave provisions common

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too broad definition** - Unenforceable if everything is "confidential"
2. **Unreasonable duration** - Courts may not enforce 10-year terms
3. **Missing exclusions** - Standard exclusions protect against unfair claims
4. **No purpose limitation** - Should specify why info is being shared
5. **Wrong jurisdiction** - Choose a jurisdiction that makes sense
6. **No signature blocks** - Needs to be properly executed

---

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific about the situation** - Context matters for appropriate terms
2. **Tell me the jurisdiction** - Laws vary significantly
3. **Specify mutual or one-way** - Don't assume
4. **Mention sensitive categories** - Trade secrets need stronger protection
5. **Ask for modifications** - I can adjust any clause

---

## Limitations

- This is a template, not legal advice
- Enforceability varies by jurisdiction
- Complex situations need attorney review
- I can't predict how courts will interpret terms
- Some provisions may not be enforceable everywhere

---

## Languages

Works with multiple languages including English and Chinese.
Just specify your preferred language when requesting an NDA.
