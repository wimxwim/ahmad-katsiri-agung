- [ ] **Unexpected attachment**: Especially .exe, .zip, .docm

### Link Analysis
- [ ] **Hover reveals different URL**: Display vs actual link
- [ ] **Shortened URLs**: bit.ly, tinyurl hiding destination
- [ ] **HTTP (not HTTPS)**: Insecure for sensitive pages
- [ ] **Misspelled domains**: paypa1.com, netlfix.com
- [ ] **IP address URLs**: http://192.168.1.1/login
