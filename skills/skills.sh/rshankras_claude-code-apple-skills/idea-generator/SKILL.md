# Idea Generator Skill

Generates a ranked shortlist of 3-5 app ideas tailored to the developer's skills, interests, and constraints. Output is formatted to feed directly into the product-agent skill for validation.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Doesn't have an app idea yet
- Says "what should I build?" or "I don't know what to build"
- Wants to brainstorm app ideas
- Is stuck after a previous idea was rejected or abandoned
- Wants to explore what's possible with a specific technology (e.g., "what can I build with Foundation Models?")
- Wants inspiration based on their skills or domain expertise
- Asks for a brainstorm session

**Already has a specific idea?** Skip this skill. Use the product-agent skill instead.

## What This Skill Does

### 1. Developer Profile Elicitation

Gathers context about the developer to personalize ideas:
- **Technical skills** — Languages, frameworks, platforms (Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, CloudKit, etc.)
- **Domain interests** — Health, finance, productivity, education, creativity, etc.
- **Platform preference** — iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, visionOS, or multi-platform
- **Time availability** — Side project (5-10 hrs/week), full-time, weekend hack
- **Constraints** — Budget, backend experience, design skills, existing audience

### 2. Five Brainstorming Lenses

Each lens generates 5-8 raw ideas. Lenses are applied in order:

1. **Skills & Interests** — What can you uniquely build given what you know?
2. **Problem-First** — What took 30 seconds today that should take 5? What's annoying?
3. **Technology-First** — Which Apple frameworks have few indie apps? (Foundation Models, ActivityKit, WidgetKit, VisionKit, WeatherKit, MapKit)
4. **Market Gap** — Where are App Store categories underserved, stale, or overpriced?
5. **Trend-Based** — What macro trends create new app opportunities? (AI-native, privacy-first, health/wellness, single-use utilities, Apple Silicon productivity)

### 3. Feasibility Filtering

Each raw idea is evaluated against five filters:

| Filter | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Solo Dev Scope | Can one developer ship an MVP in 4-8 weeks? |
| Platform API Fit | Does this leverage Apple platform APIs well? |
| Monetization Viability | Is there a clear path to revenue? |
| Competition Density | How crowded is this space? |
| Technical Complexity | Does the developer have the skills to build this? |

### 4. Scoring and Ranking

Each surviving idea is scored across five dimensions:

| Dimension | WEAK (1-2) | MODERATE (3-5) | STRONG (6-8) | EXCELLENT (9-10) |
|-----------|------------|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Solo Dev Scope | 6+ months | 3-6 months | 4-8 weeks | 2-4 weeks |
| Platform API Fit | Generic/cross-platform | Some native APIs | Good platform integration | Deep Apple API usage |
| Monetization | Unclear model | Ad-supported or low ARPU | Subscription viable | Premium pricing justified |
| Competition | Dominated by incumbents | Crowded but fragmented | Few quality options | Blue ocean |
| Technical Fit | Major skill gaps | Some learning needed | Good skill match | Perfect skill match |

**Overall Score** = weighted average on 1-10 scale (Solo Dev Scope and Technical Fit weighted 1.5x).

### 5. Shortlist Output

Final output is a ranked list of 3-5 ideas, each with:
- One-liner description
- Which lens generated it
- Problem statement and target user
- Feasibility scores
- Monetization model
- MVP scope estimate
- `next_step` description for feeding the idea into the product-agent skill

## How to Generate Ideas

### Step 1: Gather Developer Profile

If the user hasn't provided context, ask using AskUserQuestion:

**Questions to ask:**
- What programming languages and frameworks do you know? (Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, etc.)
- What topics or domains interest you? (health, finance, productivity, etc.)
- Which Apple platforms do you want to target?
- How much time can you dedicate? (side project, full-time, weekend hack)
- Any constraints? (no backend, solo dev, no design skills, etc.)

If the user provides partial info, infer reasonable defaults and state assumptions.

### Step 2: Apply Skills & Interests Lens

Generate 5-8 ideas from the intersection of what the developer knows and cares about.

**Process:**
1. List the developer's top 3-5 skills
2. List their top 3-5 interests
3. For each skill-interest pair, ask: "What app could a developer with [skill] build for people interested in [interest]?"
4. Prefer ideas that use 2+ of their skills simultaneously

**Example:** Swift + HealthKit + fitness interest → workout recovery timer, exercise form checker, fitness challenge app

### Step 3: Apply Problem-First Lens

Find real problems worth solving.

**Process:**
1. Ask the developer: "What took 30 seconds today that should take 5?"
2. Think about common daily friction points in their domain
3. Search for complaint threads: `"[domain] app sucks" OR "[domain] app wish" site:reddit.com`
4. Look for manual processes people do with spreadsheets or notes

**Example:** "I always forget which supplements I took" → supplement tracking app

### Step 4: Apply Technology-First Lens

Identify Apple frameworks with few quality indie apps.

**High-opportunity frameworks (2026):**
- **Foundation Models** — On-device LLM, few indie apps yet
- **ActivityKit / Live Activities** — Sports, cooking, transit, workout tracking
- **WidgetKit** — Glanceable info apps (many categories underserved)
- **VisionKit** — Document scanning, text recognition, visual lookup
- **WeatherKit** — Hyper-local weather for niche use cases
- **SensorKit / Core Motion** — Movement, posture, activity detection
- **DeviceActivity / Screen Time API** — Digital wellness, parental controls

**Process:**
1. Pick 2-3 frameworks matching the developer's platform preference
2. Search App Store for apps using that framework
3. Identify gaps — what should exist but doesn't?

### Step 5: Apply Market Gap Lens

Use WebSearch to find underserved App Store categories.

**Searches to run:**
```
"underserved App Store categories 2026"
"indie app opportunities iOS 2026"
"App Store category [domain] top apps" (check staleness)
"[category] app reviews complaints" site:reddit.com
```

**Signals of opportunity:**
- Top apps haven't been updated in 12+ months
- Reviews complain about the same issues across multiple apps
- Premium pricing ($9.99+) with mediocre ratings (< 4.0)
- Category has few apps but clear demand

### Step 6: Apply Trend Lens

Identify macro trends creating new app opportunities.

**Current trends (2026):**
- **AI-native apps** — Apps that couldn't exist without on-device AI
- **Privacy-first** — Apps that explicitly don't collect data (selling point)
- **Health & wellness** — Mental health, sleep, nutrition, fitness
- **Single-use utilities** — Do one thing exceptionally well
- **Apple Silicon productivity** — Pro tools for Mac (M-series GPU, Neural Engine)
- **Aging population** — Accessibility, health monitoring, simplified tech
- **Creator economy** — Tools for content creators, freelancers

**Process:**
1. Pick 2-3 trends relevant to the developer's interests
2. For each trend, generate 2-3 ideas that serve the trend
3. Prefer trend + skill intersections

### Step 7: Filter, Score, and Rank

**Filter phase:**
1. Collect all raw ideas from Steps 2-6 (typically 25-40 ideas)
2. Apply the five feasibility filters (see Section 3)
3. Remove any idea that scores WEAK on Solo Dev Scope or Technical Fit
4. Remove any idea that scores WEAK on 3+ dimensions

**Score phase:**
1. Score each surviving idea on all five dimensions
2. Calculate overall score (Solo Dev Scope and Technical Fit weighted 1.5x)
3. Rank by overall score descending

**Output phase:**
1. Take the top 3-5 ideas
2. Write full entries with all fields from Output Structure
3. Format `next_step` as description for the product-agent skill
4. List 1-3 filtered-out ideas with reasons
5. Write a recommendation highlighting Rank 1 and why

## End-to-End Example

**Developer profile:**
> Maya, backend engineer (Python, some Swift), interested in nutrition and cooking. Wants to build her first iOS app as a side project (8 hrs/week). No design skills. Comfortable with APIs but no HealthKit experience.

**Lens application:**

1. **Skills & Interests →** Recipe nutrition calculator (Swift + API skills + nutrition interest), meal prep planner, ingredient substitution finder
2. **Problem-First →** "I never know if my meals hit my protein target" → macro tracker that works from photos, "grocery lists from recipes are always wrong" → smart grocery list
3. **Technology-First →** Foundation Models → describe leftovers and get recipe suggestions, VisionKit → scan nutrition labels and auto-log
4. **Market Gap →** Searched "nutrition app complaints reddit" → users hate manual food logging, want simpler interfaces, tired of ads in free tier
5. **Trend →** AI-native + health/wellness → on-device food recognition, privacy-first nutrition tracking (no cloud data)

**After filtering and scoring:**

| Rank | Idea | Score | Key Strength |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | AI Leftover Recipe Finder | 8.1 | Foundation Models + cooking interest, blue ocean |
| 2 | Photo Macro Tracker | 7.4 | Problem-first (everyone hates manual logging) |
| 3 | Smart Grocery List | 6.9 | Simple scope, clear monetization |

**Recommendation:** "Start with AI Leftover Recipe Finder. It uses Foundation Models (few competitors), aligns with your cooking interest, and can ship a basic version in 5 weeks. Run the product-agent skill to validate demand."

## Integration with Other Skills

```
Phase 0: idea-generator (THIS SKILL)
    ↓ pick 1 idea from shortlist
Phase 1: product-agent → validate the problem
    ↓
Phase 2: market-research / competitive-analysis → size the opportunity
    ↓
Phase 3: prd-generator → define features
    ↓
Phase 4: architecture-spec → technical design
    ↓
Phase 5+: ux-spec, implementation-guide, test-spec, release-spec
```

The `next_step` field in each shortlist entry describes what to feed into the product-agent skill. After the user picks their favorite idea, they can run it directly to kick off Phase 1 validation.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Already has a specific idea** — Go directly to the product-agent skill
- **Already validated an idea** — Go to `market-research` or `competitive-analysis`
- **Wants code generation** — Use the `generators/` skills
- **Building to learn only** — Skip feasibility filtering; just pick what's fun
- **Hard deadline** — Skip brainstorming; go straight to the product-agent skill with whatever idea you have
