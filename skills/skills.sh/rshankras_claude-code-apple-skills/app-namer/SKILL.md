# App Namer Skill

Takes an app idea or one-liner and produces a ranked shortlist of 5-8 **validated** name candidates — not random brainstorming. Each candidate is generated from a naming archetype, paired with a subtitle, checked against App Store display rules, and run through an availability gauntlet (App Store Connect name, trademark, domain, handle) before it's recommended.

The output is a name you can reserve in App Store Connect today, with the keyword work already aligned to feed the `app-store/keyword-optimizer` skill.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Has an app idea but no name ("what should I call it?")
- Wants name ideas or a naming brainstorm for a specific app
- Needs to know if a name is available / safe to use
- Is about to create the app record in App Store Connect and needs to reserve a name
- Wants to rename an existing app and needs ownable, ASO-smart options
- Picked an idea from `idea-generator` and needs the name before writing the PRD

**No app idea yet?** Run `product/idea-generator` first, then come back with the chosen idea.

**Already have a locked name and just want ASO?** Skip this skill — go to `app-store/keyword-optimizer`.

## Reference Files

Before generating names, load both reference files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **naming-strategies.md** | The 3 archetypes, naming techniques, App Store display mechanics (30-char limit, home-screen truncation, name/subtitle interplay), good/bad examples |
| **validation-checklist.md** | The knockout gauntlet — App Store Connect name availability, trademark sanity check, domain/.app, social handles, linguistic safety |

## What This Skill Does

```
Idea/positioning
   ↓  elicit
Naming brief (what it does, who it's for, personality, scope ceiling)
   ↓  generate across archetypes
20-40 raw candidates (branded / descriptive / hybrid)
   ↓  filter (pronounce, spell, truncate, confusability)
8-12 survivors
   ↓  pair with subtitle + score
Ranked candidates with name + subtitle + display preview
   ↓  validate (ASC name / trademark / domain / handle)
5-8 validated candidates
   ↓
Recommendation + "reserve now" action
```

## The Naming Process

### Step 1: Build the Naming Brief

If the user hasn't given enough context, gather it with AskUserQuestion. You need:

| Field | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **One-liner** | What the app does in one sentence — drives descriptive/hybrid candidates |
| **Target user** | Tone calibration (pro tool vs. playful consumer app) |
| **Personality** | Serious, playful, minimal, premium, technical? Sets the archetype mix |
| **Category** | App Store category — affects trademark class and competitor naming norms |
| **Scope ceiling** | Will it stay single-purpose or grow? A too-descriptive name boxes you in |
| **Existing brand** | Company/developer name, existing app family to stay consistent with |

If the user gives a one-liner and nothing else, infer sensible defaults, **state your assumptions**, and proceed — don't block on a full questionnaire.

### Step 2: Generate Across Archetypes

Generate 20-40 raw candidates spread across the three archetypes (see **naming-strategies.md** for each technique and examples):

1. **Branded / invented** — coined, ownable, zero literal meaning (Spotify, Halide, Bevel, Bear)
2. **Descriptive** — says what it does, carries a keyword (Sleep Cycle, PDF Expert, Pocket Casts)
3. **Hybrid / suggestive** — a real or twisted word that evokes the benefit (Streaks, Overcast, Carrot Weather, Drafts)

Aim for roughly **40% hybrid, 30% branded, 30% descriptive** for a typical indie app — hybrid names tend to win because they're ownable *and* memorable, with the descriptive keyword pushed into the subtitle.

Use the techniques in **naming-strategies.md**: real words, compounds, portmanteaus, prefix/suffix, dropped vowels, foreign words, metaphors.

### Step 3: Filter Hard and Fast

Kill any candidate that fails a basic filter before spending effort scoring it:

- ❌ Can't be pronounced correctly on first read
- ❌ Can't be spelled correctly after hearing it once (the "radio test")
- ❌ (iOS) Doesn't read cleanly when truncated to ~12 characters on the Home Screen — relaxes for Mac apps (see naming-strategies.md)
- ❌ Confusable with a major existing app (Notes, Notion, Things, etc.)
- ❌ Purely generic/descriptive with no distinctiveness (un-trademarkable)
- ❌ Produces an ugly bundle ID or has awkward casing

Target 8-12 survivors going into scoring.

### Step 4: Pair With a Subtitle

For each survivor, write the `Name — Subtitle` pairing the way it appears on the App Store. This is where the ASO strategy lives:

```
[Brand Name] — [Descriptive keyword phrase]

Halide — Pro Camera
Streaks — Habit Tracker
Bear — Markdown Notes
```

The **name** carries the brand; the **subtitle** carries the searchable keywords. This means a branded/hybrid name doesn't need to be descriptive — the subtitle does that job. Both are 30-char fields and both are indexed. (See `app-store/keyword-optimizer` for full keyword allocation.)

### Step 5: Score Each Candidate

Score each candidate 1-10 on six dimensions:

| Dimension | WEAK (1-3) | STRONG (4-7) | EXCELLENT (8-10) |
|-----------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Memorability** | Forgettable, generic | Distinctive | Sticky, instantly recalled |
| **Clarity/Fit** | Misleading or opaque | Evokes the benefit (with subtitle) | Name+subtitle = instant understanding |
| **Availability** | Name & domain taken, TM conflict | Domain workaround, name free | Name + .com/.app + clean TM headroom |
| **ASO Value** | Dead keyword-wise | Subtitle carries keywords | Brandable + subtitle owns a keyword |
| **Pronounce/Spell** | Fails radio test | Minor ambiguity | Say it once, spell it right, Siri-safe |
| **Scalability** | Boxed into v1 scope | Some room | Grows with the product |

**Overall = weighted average**, with **Availability and Memorability weighted 1.5×** (an unavailable name scores zero regardless of how clever it is).

### Step 6: Validate the Top Candidates

Run the top 5-8 through the gauntlet in **validation-checklist.md**. For each, record status as `available` / `taken` / `conflict` / `unchecked`:

1. **App Store name** — exact-name search on the App Store; reserve in App Store Connect if clear
2. **Trademark knockout** — USPTO/EUIPO + web search in the software class (not legal clearance)
3. **Domain** — `.com`, then `.app`, then `get-/try-/use-` prefixes
4. **Social handle** — consistent handle across X / Instagram (nice-to-have)
5. **Linguistic safety** — no bad meanings in top ASO markets, Siri-pronounceable

Use WebSearch/WebFetch to check what's checkable (existing App Store apps, trademark databases, domain registrars). For anything you can't verify, mark it `unchecked` and tell the user exactly how to check — **never report a name as available if you didn't verify it.**

### Step 7: Recommend and Reserve

Present the ranked shortlist, then make a single clear recommendation. End with the action: **reserve the winning name in App Store Connect now** — App Store names are unique and first-come, so a name that's available today can be gone tomorrow.

## End-to-End Example

**Brief:** "A minimalist iOS app that tracks daily water intake with a single tap. For health-conscious people who find existing trackers cluttered. Personality: clean, calm, premium. Stays single-purpose."

**Generate (sample of ~30):**
- *Branded:* Drift, Sip, Wello, Aqo, Nim
- *Descriptive:* Water Daily, Hydrate, Daily Water, Intake
- *Hybrid:* Gulp, Tide, Droplet, Wave, Brim, Flow

**Filter:** Drop "Intake" (generic, taken), "Hydrate" (crowded, hard to own), "Aqo" (fails spell test).

**Pair + score top survivors:**

| Name | Pairing | Memorable | Avail. | ASO | Overall |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|-----|---------|
| Brim | Brim — Water Tracker | 8 | 7 | 7 | 7.6 |
| Sip | Sip — Daily Water | 9 | 5 | 7 | 7.2 |
| Droplet | Droplet — Hydration | 7 | 6 | 8 | 7.0 |

**Validate (top 3):** "Sip" — App Store name almost certainly taken (very common), sip.com taken. "Brim" — exact App Store name worth checking, brim.app likely available, no obvious TM conflict in Class 9. "Droplet" — used by DigitalOcean (TM risk in software).

**Recommendation:** "Go with **Brim — Water Tracker**. It's short (stands alone on the Home Screen), calm and ownable, almost certainly clears the App Store name, and `brim.app` is available. Avoid Droplet (DigitalOcean trademark in software). Reserve 'Brim' in App Store Connect now, then run keyword-optimizer to fill the subtitle and keyword field around 'water, hydration, drink, reminder.'"

## Integration With Other Skills

```
product/idea-generator        → pick an idea
        ↓
product/app-namer (THIS SKILL) → name it + reserve it
        ↓
app-store/keyword-optimizer    → lock subtitle + 100-char keywords around the name
        ↓
product/prd-generator          → [App Name] is now filled in
        ↓
generators/app-icon-generator  → icon that matches the name's personality
```

The name you pick here is the highest-weighted ASO field and a permanent brand decision — it flows into the keyword strategy, the PRD, the icon, and the bundle ID. Get it right before you build.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **No idea yet** — run `idea-generator` first
- **Name is already locked** — go to `keyword-optimizer` for ASO
- **You need the legal clearance** — this skill does a *knockout* search, not trademark clearance; consult an attorney before filing
- **Renaming a high-traffic live app** — renaming resets branded search equity; see `keyword-optimizer/existing-app-strategy.md` before changing a name that's working
