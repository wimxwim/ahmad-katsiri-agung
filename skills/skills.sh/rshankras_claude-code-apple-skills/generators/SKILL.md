# Code Generators

Production-ready code generators for iOS and macOS apps. Unlike advisory skills (review, audit), these skills generate working code tailored to your project.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Wants to add a common app component (logging, analytics, onboarding, etc.)
- Asks to "set up" or "add" infrastructure code
- Mentions replacing print() with proper logging
- Wants to add App Store review prompts
- Needs analytics or crash reporting setup

## Key Principles

### 1. Context-Aware Generation
Before generating code, skills will:
- Read existing project structure and patterns
- Detect deployment targets and Swift version
- Identify architecture patterns (MVVM, TCA, etc.)
- Check for existing implementations to avoid conflicts

### 2. Protocol-Based Architecture
Provider-dependent code uses protocols for easy swapping:
```swift
protocol AnalyticsService { ... }
class TelemetryDeckAnalytics: AnalyticsService { ... }
class FirebaseAnalytics: AnalyticsService { ... }
// Change provider by swapping ONE line
```

### 3. Platform Detection
Skills detect iOS vs macOS and App Store vs direct distribution to generate appropriate code.

## How to Use

1. User requests a component (e.g., "add logging to my app")
2. Read the relevant skill's SKILL.md
3. Run pre-generation checks (conflicts, deployment target, etc.)
4. Ask configuration questions via AskUserQuestion
5. Generate code from templates, adapting to project context
6. Provide integration instructions

## Output Format

After generation, always provide:
- **Files created** (with full paths)
- **Integration steps** (how to wire into existing code)
- **Required capabilities** (entitlements, dependencies)
- **Testing instructions** (how to verify it works)
