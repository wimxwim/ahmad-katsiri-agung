## 9. CI/CD Automation (Optional but Recommended)

### 9.1 Fastlane Setup

**Install Fastlane**:
```bash
# Using Homebrew (Mac)
brew install fastlane

# Or using RubyGems
sudo gem install fastlane
```

**Initialize Fastlane**:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
fastlane init
```

**Follow prompts**:
1. What would you like to use fastlane for?
   → 2. Automate beta distribution to TestFlight
2. Select your Apple ID
3. Select app
4. Fastlane creates `fastlane/` directory with Fastfile

### 9.2 Fastfile Configuration

**Edit `fastlane/Fastfile`**:

```ruby
# Fastfile

default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  # Variables
  xcodeproj = "[AppName].xcodeproj"
  scheme = "[AppName]"
  bundle_id = "com.yourcompany.appname"

  # Before all lanes
  before_all do
    # Ensure git status is clean
    ensure_git_status_clean
  end

  # Lane: Run tests
  desc "Run all tests"
  lane :test do
    run_tests(
      scheme: scheme,
      devices: ["iPhone 15 Pro"]
    )
  end

  # Lane: Build app
  desc "Build the app"
  lane :build do
    gym(
      scheme: scheme,
      export_method: "app-store",
      output_directory: "./build"
    )
  end

  # Lane: Upload to TestFlight
  desc "Upload to TestFlight"
  lane :beta do
    # Increment build number
    increment_build_number(xcodeproj: xcodeproj)

    # Build
    gym(
      scheme: scheme,
      export_method: "app-store"
    )

    # Upload
    pilot(
      skip_waiting_for_build_processing: false,
      distribute_external: true,  # Share with external testers
      changelog: "Bug fixes and improvements"
    )
  end

  # Lane: Release to App Store
  desc "Upload to App Store and submit for review"
  lane :release do
    # Ensure main branch
    ensure_git_branch(branch: "main")

    # Run tests
    test

    # Increment version
    version = prompt(text: "Enter version number (e.g., 1.0.0): ")
    increment_version_number(version_number: version)

    # Increment build
    increment_build_number(xcodeproj: xcodeproj)

    # Build
    gym(
      scheme: scheme,
      export_method: "app-store"
    )

    # Upload to App Store Connect
    deliver(
      submit_for_review: true,
      automatic_release: false,
      force: true,  # Skip HTML preview
      metadata_path: "./fastlane/metadata",
      screenshots_path: "./fastlane/screenshots"
    )

    # Tag release
    add_git_tag(tag: "v#{version}")
    push_git_tags

    # Commit version bump
    commit_version_bump(
      message: "Version bump to #{version}",
      xcodeproj: xcodeproj
    )
    push_to_git_remote
  end

  # Error handling
  error do |lane, exception|
    notification(
      subtitle: "Failed to #{lane}",
      message: exception.message
    )
  end
end
```

### 9.3 Fastlane Metadata

**Setup metadata for automatic upload**:

```bash
fastlane deliver init
```

This creates `fastlane/metadata/` with folders for each locale:
```
fastlane/
└── metadata/
    └── en-US/
        ├── description.txt          # App description
        ├── keywords.txt             # Keywords
        ├── marketing_url.txt        # Marketing URL
        ├── name.txt                 # App name
        ├── privacy_url.txt          # Privacy URL
        ├── release_notes.txt        # What's New
        ├── subtitle.txt             # Subtitle
        └── support_url.txt          # Support URL
```

**Copy content from ASO optimization** into these files.

**Screenshots**:
- Place in `fastlane/screenshots/en-US/`
- Name: `1_iphone65_1.png`, `1_iphone65_2.png`, etc.

### 9.4 GitHub Actions Integration

**Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`**:

```yaml

        run: echo "Successfully released to App Store!"

      - name: Notify on failure

## Integration with Workflow

This skill is typically:
- **Sixth step** in specification generation
- Activated after PRD, Architecture, UX, Implementation, and Testing specs are complete
- Final specification before implementation begins
- Critical for successful App Store launch

The release specification ensures the app reaches users and succeeds in the market.

## Notes

- App Store review can be unpredictable - plan for rejections
- TestFlight beta testing is crucial - don't skip it
- Privacy compliance is non-negotiable - get it right
- First impressions matter - polish screenshots and description
- Post-launch monitoring is as important as pre-launch prep
- Respond to reviews - it shows you care
- Plan for updates - v1.0 is just the beginning
- Marketing is not optional - no one will find your app without it
