# Continuity Ledger

> **Note:** This skill is now an alias for `/create_handoff`. Both output the same YAML format.

Create a YAML handoff document for state preservation across `/clear`. This is the same as `/create_handoff`.

## Process

### 1. Filepath & Metadata

**First, determine the session name from existing handoffs:**
```bash
ls -td thoughts/shared/handoffs/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs basename
```

This returns the most recently modified handoff folder name (e.g., `open-source-release`). Use this as the handoff folder name.

If no handoffs exist, use `general` as the folder name.

**Create your file under:** `thoughts/shared/handoffs/{session-name}/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_description.yaml`, where:
- `{session-name}` is from existing handoffs (e.g., `open-source-release`) or `general` if none exist
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is today's date
- `HH-MM` is the current time in 24-hour format (no seconds needed)
- `description` is a brief kebab-case description

**Examples:**
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/open-source-release/2026-01-08_16-30_memory-system-fix.yaml`
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2026-01-08_16-30_bug-investigation.yaml`

### 2. Write YAML handoff (~400 tokens)

**CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY this YAML format. Do NOT deviate or use alternative field names.**

The `goal:` and `now:` fields are shown in the statusline - they MUST be named exactly this.

```yaml
---
session: {session-name from ledger}
date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: complete|partial|blocked
outcome: SUCCEEDED|PARTIAL_PLUS|PARTIAL_MINUS|FAILED
---

goal: {What this session accomplished - shown in statusline}
now: {What next session should do first - shown in statusline}
test: {Command to verify this work, e.g., pytest tests/test_foo.py}

done_this_session:
  - task: {First completed task}
    files: [{file1.py}, {file2.py}]
  - task: {Second completed task}
    files: [{file3.py}]

blockers: [{any blocking issues}]

questions: [{unresolved questions for next session}]

decisions:
  - {decision_name}: {rationale}

findings:
  - {key_finding}: {details}

worked: [{approaches that worked}]
failed: [{approaches that failed and why}]

next:
  - {First next step}
  - {Second next step}

files:
  created: [{new files}]
  modified: [{changed files}]
```

**Field guide:**
- `goal:` + `now:` - REQUIRED, shown in statusline
- `done_this_session:` - What was accomplished with file references
- `decisions:` - Important choices and rationale
- `findings:` - Key learnings
- `worked:` / `failed:` - What to repeat vs avoid
- `next:` - Action items for next session

**DO NOT use alternative field names like `session_goal`, `objective`, `focus`, `current`, etc.**
**The statusline parser looks for EXACTLY `goal:` and `now:` - nothing else works.**

### 3. Mark Session Outcome (REQUIRED)

**IMPORTANT:** Before responding to the user, you MUST ask about the session outcome.

Use the AskUserQuestion tool with these exact options:

```
Question: "How did this session go?"
Options:
  - SUCCEEDED: Task completed successfully
  - PARTIAL_PLUS: Mostly done, minor issues remain
  - PARTIAL_MINUS: Some progress, major issues remain
  - FAILED: Task abandoned or blocked
```

After the user responds, mark the outcome:
```bash
# Mark the most recent handoff (works with PostgreSQL or SQLite)
PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}")
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT/opc" && uv run python scripts/core/artifact_mark.py --latest --outcome <USER_CHOICE>
```

### 4. Confirm completion

After marking the outcome, respond to the user:

```
Handoff created! Outcome marked as [OUTCOME].

Resume in a new session with:
/resume_handoff path/to/handoff.yaml
```

## When to Use

- Before running `/clear`
- Context usage approaching 70%+
- Multi-day implementations
- Complex refactors you pick up/put down
- Any session expected to hit 85%+ context

## When NOT to Use

- Quick tasks (< 30 min)
- Simple bug fixes
- Single-file changes

## Why Clear Instead of Compact?

Each compaction is lossy compression—after several compactions, you're working with degraded context. Clearing + loading the handoff gives you fresh context with full signal.
