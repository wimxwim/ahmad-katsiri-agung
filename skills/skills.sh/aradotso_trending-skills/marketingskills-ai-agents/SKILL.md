# Marketing Skills for AI Agents

> Skill by [ara.so](https://ara.so) — Daily 2026 Skills collection.

[coreyhaines31/marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills) is a collection of markdown-based AI agent skills covering CRO, copywriting, SEO, analytics, paid ads, email, and growth engineering. Install them once and any compatible agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf) gains specialized marketing expertise and frameworks.

---

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a markdown file that tells AI agents:
- **When to activate** (trigger phrases)
- **What frameworks to apply** (e.g. AIDA, PAS, Jobs-to-be-Done)
- **What to produce** (copy, code, audits, strategies)
- **Which other skills to reference** (cross-skill dependencies)

All skills read `product-marketing-context` first — it's the shared foundation containing your product, audience, and positioning.

---

## Installation

### Option 1: CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install all 33 skills at once
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install only specific skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --skill page-cro copywriting seo-audit

# See all available skills before installing
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --list
```

Skills land in `.agents/skills/` with a symlink to `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code.

### Option 2: Claude Code Plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add coreyhaines31/marketingskills
/plugin install marketing-skills
```

### Option 3: Git Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git
cp -r marketingskills/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

### Option 4: Git Submodule (for team projects)

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git .agents/marketingskills
# Reference skills from .agents/marketingskills/skills/
```

## Project Structure

```

Each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` (or `README.md`) with structured instructions the agent reads.

## First Step: Set Up Product Marketing Context

Before using any other skill, create your context file. This is the single most important step.

```
"Create my product marketing context"
```

The agent will generate `.agents/skills/product-marketing-context/context.md` by asking about:
- Product name, description, and category
- Target audience and ICPs
- Core value proposition and positioning
- Key competitors
- Pricing and business model
- Tone and brand voice

Every other skill reads this file automatically before executing.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Audit and improve a landing page

```
"Audit my landing page at src/pages/index.tsx and suggest CRO improvements"
```

The agent reads `product-marketing-context`, activates `page-cro`, then:
1. Reviews the page structure, headline, CTA placement
2. Applies frameworks (AIDA, above-the-fold analysis, social proof audit)
3. Outputs a prioritized list of changes with implementation code

### Example 2: Write a homepage from scratch

```
"Write homepage copy for my SaaS product using the copywriting skill"
```

Output includes hero headline variants, subheadline, feature sections, social proof blocks, and CTAs — all grounded in your `product-marketing-context`.

### Example 3: Set up A/B testing

```
"Help me set up an A/B test for my pricing page CTA button"
```

The agent activates `ab-test-setup` and generates:

```javascript
// Example output: Google Optimize / custom A/B test scaffold
const experiments = {
  pricing_cta_test: {
    id: 'pricing-cta-v1',
    variants: [
      { id: 'control', cta: 'Start Free Trial' },
      { id: 'variant_a', cta: 'Get Started Free' },
      { id: 'variant_b', cta: 'Try It Free — No Card Required' }
    ],
    metric: 'signup_click',
    minimumDetectableEffect: 0.05,
    confidenceLevel: 0.95
  }
};

// Split traffic deterministically by user ID
function getVariant(userId, experimentId) {
  const hash = simpleHash(`${userId}-${experimentId}`);
  const variantIndex = hash % experiments[experimentId].variants.length;
  return experiments[experimentId].variants[variantIndex];
}
```

### Example 4: Generate programmatic SEO pages

```
"Create a programmatic SEO page template for '[tool] alternatives' pages"
```

The agent activates `programmatic-seo` + `competitor-alternatives` and scaffolds:

```javascript
// Next.js dynamic route: /pages/[competitor]-alternatives.js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const competitors = await fetchCompetitors(); // your data source
  return {
    paths: competitors.map(c => ({ params: { competitor: c.slug } })),
    fallback: 'blocking'
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const data = await getCompetitorData(params.competitor);
  return { props: { competitor: data }, revalidate: 86400 };
}
```

### Example 5: Build an email sequence

```
"Write a 5-email onboarding sequence for new trial users"
```

Activates `email-sequence` + `onboarding-cro`. Produces:
- Email 1: Welcome + single activation action (Day 0)
- Email 2: Value reinforcement + feature highlight (Day 2)
- Email 3: Social proof / case study (Day 4)
- Email 4: Overcome objections / FAQ (Day 6)
- Email 5: Trial ending + upgrade CTA (Day 8)

Each with subject line, preview text, body copy, and CTA.

### Example 6: Schema markup for SEO

```
"Add schema markup to my blog post template"
```

```javascript
// Output: JSON-LD for Article schema
const articleSchema = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": post.title,
  "description": post.excerpt,
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": post.author.name,
    "url": post.author.url
  },
  "datePublished": post.publishedAt,
  "dateModified": post.updatedAt,
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": process.env.SITE_NAME,
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": process.env.SITE_LOGO_URL
    }
  }
};
```

## Skill Cross-References (Dependency Map)

When working on a task, the agent may activate multiple skills together:

```
Landing page optimization:
  page-cro → copywriting → ab-test-setup → analytics-tracking

SEO content strategy:
  seo-audit → content-strategy → ai-seo → schema-markup

Sales pipeline:
  revops → sales-enablement → cold-email → email-sequence

Growth loop:
  free-tool-strategy → programmatic-seo → referral-program → analytics-tracking
```

You can invoke multiple skills explicitly:

```
"Use page-cro and copywriting skills to rewrite my /pricing page"
"Apply marketing-psychology and copywriting to my checkout flow"
```

---

## Configuration

No config file required. Skills are self-contained markdown files. The only configuration is your `product-marketing-context` document.

To update your context at any time:

```
"Update my product marketing context — we just changed our target audience to enterprise"
```

---

## Adding Custom Skills

Create a new skill directory following the same pattern:

```bash
mkdir .agents/skills/my-custom-skill
cat > .agents/skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-custom-skill
description: What this skill does
triggers:
  - phrase that activates this skill
---

# My Custom Skill

## When to Use
...

## Process
...

## Related Skills
- product-marketing-context (always read first)
EOF
```

---

## Contributing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git
cd marketingskills

# Add a new skill
mkdir skills/my-new-skill
# Create skills/my-new-skill/README.md following existing skill format

# Update the skills table in README.md
# Open a PR
```

The `README.md` skills table is auto-generated between `<!-- SKILLS:START -->` and `<!-- SKILLS:END -->` markers.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Skills not activating in Claude Code**
```bash
# Verify symlink exists
ls -la .claude/skills/
# If missing, re-run install
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills
```

**Agent ignoring product context**
- Make sure `.agents/skills/product-marketing-context/context.md` exists
- If missing: `"Create my product marketing context"` to regenerate it

**Installing specific skills only**
```bash
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --skill copywriting page-cro seo-audit analytics-tracking
```

**Updating to latest skills**
```bash
npx skills update coreyhaines31/marketingskills
# or if using submodule:
git submodule update --remote .agents/marketingskills
```

**Skill conflicts with other installed skill packs**
- Skills are namespaced by directory — no conflicts expected
- If an agent activates the wrong skill, be explicit: `"Use the page-cro skill from marketingskills"`
