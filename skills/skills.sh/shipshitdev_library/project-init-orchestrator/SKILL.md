description: Selects the correct project initialization route and orchestrates setup. Triggers on "initialize project", "set up new project", "bootstrap project", or when scaffolding a new Shipshit.dev product repo. Use v0 for new Shipshit.dev product repos; use lower-level setup skills only for existing repo repair, customization, or small additions.

# Project Init Orchestrator

Choose the smallest safe setup route. For new Shipshit.dev product repos, prefer `npx @shipshitdev/v0`
as the primary scaffolder. Use the lower-level init skills for existing repos,
repairs, or project types not covered by v0.

## Contract

Inputs:

- Target project path and project name
- Project type: new Shipshit.dev product, existing repo, docs-only, library, or custom
- Desired app surfaces, routes, agent platform support, and GitHub setup

Outputs:

- Selected initialization route
- List of delegated skills or v0 command used
- Files/directories created or modified
- Verification status and remaining manual setup

Creates/Modifies:

- New product repos through `npx @shipshitdev/v0`
- Existing repo `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, lint, test, and scaffold files when delegated

External Side Effects:

- May install dependencies when using v0 or delegated setup skills
- May create a GitHub repo or issue only when the v0 command is run with GitHub flags

Confirmation Required:

- Before creating a GitHub repo or issue
- Before running setup outside the current workspace
- Before overwriting existing agent/config files

Delegates To:

- `fullstack-workspace-init` for v0-backed Shipshit.dev product scaffolding
- `agent-folder-init` for existing repos that only need AI project context
- `linter-formatter-init`, `testing-cicd-init`, and `husky-test-coverage` for repo repair
- `scaffold` for small module/component additions inside an existing codebase

## When to Use

This skill activates automatically when users:

- Start a new project from scratch
- Want full Shipshit.dev product setup with one command
- Need AI-first development infrastructure + code quality tools
- Say "initialize project", "set up new project", "bootstrap project"
- Want consistent setup across multiple projects

## Skills Orchestrated

| Order | Skill | Purpose | Required |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| 1 | `fullstack-workspace-init` / `npx @shipshitdev/v0` | New Shipshit.dev product repo | Conditional |
| 2 | `agent-folder-init` | AI documentation & standards for existing repos | Conditional |
| 3 | `linter-formatter-init` | ESLint/Biome + formatter + pre-commit repair | Conditional |
| 4 | `testing-cicd-init` / `husky-test-coverage` | Test and CI gates | Optional |
| 5 | `scaffold` | Incremental module/component additions | Optional |

## Route Selection

Use this order:

1. New Shipshit.dev product repo: run `npx @shipshitdev/v0`.
2. New non-product repo: scaffold only the requested repo structure, then add agent docs and gates.
3. Existing repo missing AI context: run `agent-folder-init`.
4. Existing repo with weak quality gates: run linter/test/CI skills only.
5. Existing repo needing one feature/module: run `scaffold` after finding 3+ examples.

For v0-backed setup, use interactive mode unless the user provides all inputs:

```bash
npx @shipshitdev/v0 <project-directory>
```

For non-interactive Shipshit.dev product setup:

```bash
npx @shipshitdev/v0 <project-directory> \
  --scope "<product scope>" \
  --agent codex \
  --apps web,app,desktop,mobile,extension,cli \
  --routes overview,new-task,search,inbox,activities \
  --no-github
```

## Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)

When user says "initialize my project" or "set up new project":

```
1. Ask for project context:
   - Project path (default: current directory)
   - New Shipshit.dev product or existing repo repair?
   - Product scope if using v0
   - App surfaces and routes if non-default
   - Agent to hand off to: codex or claude
   - Need existing-repo repair or incremental scaffolding?

2. Execute phases in order:
   v0 route OR existing-repo phases → verification
```

### Existing-Repo Repair

Use lower-level skills only after deciding v0 is not the right route:

1. `agent-folder-init` for AI docs and agent config.
2. `linter-formatter-init` for lint/format drift.
3. `testing-cicd-init` or `husky-test-coverage` for test and CI gates.
4. `scaffold` for a requested module, endpoint, component, or package.

## Route Matrix

| Request | Primary Route | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| New Shipshit.dev product repo | `npx @shipshitdev/v0` | Default route. Includes app surfaces and agent setup. |
| New non-product repo | Minimal scaffold + `agent-folder-init` | Keep setup proportional to the requested repo. |
| Existing repo AI context | `agent-folder-init` | No application source generation. |
| Existing repo quality gates | Linter/test/CI skills | Repair only the missing gates. |
| Existing repo feature/module | `scaffold` | Find 3+ local examples first. |

## Best Practices

### Sequencing

- For new Shipshit.dev products, run v0 first.
- For existing repos, add AI docs before repo-specific repair work.
- Run linter and formatter setup before test hooks when both are missing.
- Run `scaffold` only after the target codebase patterns are known.

### Customization

- Each phase can be skipped if already configured
- Phases are idempotent (safe to re-run)
- Configuration can be customized after orchestration

### Verification Checklist

After orchestration, verify:

- [ ] The selected route matches the user request
- [ ] New product repos were created through v0 unless explicitly exempted
- [ ] Existing repo changes are limited to the delegated repair/addition
- [ ] `bun lint`, `bun test`, or the repo's documented equivalents work when present

## Example Interaction

**User:** "Set up my new product at ~/projects/my-saas"

**Orchestrator Response:**

```
Route: new Shipshit.dev product repo → v0.

npx @shipshitdev/v0 ~/projects/my-saas --agent codex --no-github
```

## Troubleshooting

### Phase fails to complete

- Check if dependencies are installed (`node`, `python3`)
- Verify write permissions to project directory
- Check if conflicting configs exist

### Linting errors after setup

- Run `bun run lint:fix` to auto-fix
- Check `.eslintrc.js` matches your stack
- Verify TypeScript config if using TS

### Pre-commit hook not running

- Run `bunx husky install` manually
- Check `.husky/pre-commit` exists and is executable
- Verify `prepare` script in package.json
