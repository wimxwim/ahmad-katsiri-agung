# Bug

Turn a description of something broken into a GitHub issue
of type **Bug**. It drafts the report from what the user gives (plus repo context),
shows it for approval, and only then files the issue — typed `Bug` where the repo
supports issue types, otherwise labelled `bug`.

It never opens an issue without confirmation and never invents reproduction steps
or facts the user did not provide; unknowns are marked as such.

## Contract

Inputs:

- A description of the bug (free text, an error/stack trace, or a title plus details)
- The target repository (auto-detected from the current directory's remote)
- Optional: labels, assignee, milestone, or severity the user specifies

Outputs:

- A structured bug report (title + body) shown before anything is created
- Whether the issue will be typed `Bug` or labelled `bug` (and why)
- The created issue number and URL

Creates/Modifies:

- Creates one GitHub issue of type `Bug` (or with the `bug` label) via `gh`
- Applies only the labels/assignee/milestone the user asked for
- Creates the `bug` label if it is used as a fallback and does not yet exist
- Does not edit code, close other issues, or modify repository settings

External Side Effects:

- Reads repository, label, and issue-type metadata from GitHub
- Creates a GitHub issue (visible to everyone with repo access)

Confirmation Required:

- Before creating the issue — always print the drafted title + body and require an
  explicit yes
- Before creating a new `bug` label (fallback path), if one does not already exist

Delegates To:

- `gh-fix-ci` when the bug is a failing CI check the user wants fixed instead of filed
- `debug` / `systematic-debugging` when the user wants to root-cause before filing

## When to Use

- To file a clean bug report from a rough description or an error message
- To log a bug found mid-session without leaving the terminal
- When the user says "open a bug", "file this", "create a bug issue", or runs `/bug`

Do not use this skill to fix the bug, to file feature requests or tasks (those are a
different issue type), or to triage existing issues.

## Phase 1: Repository and Type Detection

```bash
gh auth status -h github.com
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,hasIssuesEnabled --jq '{repo:.nameWithOwner, issues:.hasIssuesEnabled}'
```

Stop if issues are disabled. Detect whether the repo's owner defines issue **types**
and whether a `Bug` type exists:

```bash
gh issue create --help | grep -q -- '--type' && echo "type-flag: supported"
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}" --jq '.owner.type' 2>/dev/null
```

Decide the path:

- **Bug issue type** — preferred when the org/repo exposes a `Bug` type. Use
  `--type Bug`.
- **`bug` label** — fallback when no issue types exist. Check for the label and plan
  to create it only if needed:

```bash
gh label list --search bug --json name --jq '.[].name'
```

## Phase 2: Draft the Bug Report

Structure the report from what the user gave. Keep it factual — never fabricate
steps, versions, or behavior. Mark anything unknown as `_not provided_`.

**Title:** a short, specific summary of the symptom (not "bug" or "it's broken").

**Body** (omit sections that genuinely do not apply):

```markdown
## Summary
<one or two sentences: what is broken>

## Steps to Reproduce
1. …
2. …

## Expected
<what should happen>

## Actual
<what happens instead — include the error/stack trace verbatim if provided>

## Environment
<app/service, version or commit, OS/browser, anything relevant — or _not provided_>

## Notes
<links, related issues, suspected area — only if the user gave them>
```

If the user pasted a stack trace or error, quote it verbatim in a fenced block under
**Actual**. Ask one concise follow-up only if the report is unusable without it
(e.g. no symptom at all); otherwise draft with what you have and mark gaps.

## Phase 3: Preview and Confirm

Print the full drafted issue — title, body, the type/label decision, and any
labels/assignee/milestone to apply — then stop and wait for an explicit yes. In a
read-only or dry-run request, end here and file nothing.

## Phase 4: Create the Issue

Only after confirmation, write the body to a temp file (to preserve formatting) and
create the issue.

Preferred — Bug issue type:

```bash
gh issue create --title "<title>" --body-file /tmp/bug_body.md --type Bug
```

Fallback — `bug` label (create the label first only if it is missing and the user
agreed):

```bash
gh label create bug --color d73a4a --description "Something isn't working" 2>/dev/null || true
gh issue create --title "<title>" --body-file /tmp/bug_body.md --label bug
```

Add `--assignee`, `--label`, `--milestone`, or `--project` only for values the user
specified. If `--type Bug` fails because the type does not exist, fall back to the
label path and say so rather than failing the run.

## Modes

- `bug` / `bug <description>` — Phases 1-4. Draft, confirm, file the issue. (Default.)
- `bug draft` — Phases 1-3. Draft and print the report only; create nothing.

If the user names labels, an assignee, a milestone, or a severity, honor them. If
they ask for a feature or task instead of a bug, say this skill files bugs and point
them to the right issue type.

## Final Status

Report:

- The repository and whether the issue was typed `Bug` or labelled `bug`
- The created issue number and URL
- Any labels, assignee, or milestone applied
- What to do next — e.g. root-cause with `debug` / `systematic-debugging`, or fix a
  failing check with `gh-fix-ci`
