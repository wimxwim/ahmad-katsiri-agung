# MCP Server Development Guide

# Process

## High-Level Workflow

Build an MCP server in four phases:

### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning

#### 1.1 Understand Agent-Centric Design Principles

Before implementation, design tools around agent workflows:

**Build for Workflows, Not Just API Endpoints:**

- Do not mirror every API endpoint by default. Group endpoints into workflow
  tools when one user task requires multiple API calls.
- Consolidate related operations (e.g., `schedule_event` that both checks availability and creates event)
- List the top user workflows and map each tool to one workflow.

**Optimize for Limited Context:**

- Return only fields needed for the task by default.
- Return high-signal information, not exhaustive data dumps
- Provide "concise" vs "detailed" response format options
- Default to human-readable identifiers over technical codes (names over IDs)
- Add pagination, field selection, or truncation for large responses.

**Design Actionable Error Messages:**

- Error messages include the failed field or operation, the cause, and the next
  valid action.
- Suggest specific next steps: "Try using filter='active_only' to reduce results"
- Never return raw provider errors without a tool-level explanation.

**Follow Natural Task Subdivisions:**

- Tool names should reflect how humans think about tasks
- Group related tools with consistent prefixes for discoverability
- Design tools around natural workflows, not just API structure

**Use Evaluation-Driven Development:**

- Create realistic evaluation scenarios early
- Let agent feedback drive tool improvements
- Prototype quickly and iterate based on actual agent performance

#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation

**Fetch the MCP protocol documentation:**

Use WebFetch to load: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt`

This document contains the complete MCP specification. Note: the URL may change as the spec evolves — if the fetch fails, search for the current MCP docs URL.

#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation

**Load and read the following reference files:**

- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./references/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines for all MCP servers

**For Python implementations, also load:**

- **Python SDK Documentation**: Use WebFetch to load `https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/`
- [🐍 Python Implementation Guide](./references/python_mcp_server.md) - Python-specific best practices and examples

**For Node/TypeScript implementations, also load:**

- **TypeScript SDK Documentation**: Use WebFetch to load `https://ts.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/`
- [⚡ TypeScript Implementation Guide](./references/node_mcp_server.md) - Node/TypeScript-specific best practices and examples

#### 1.4 Study API Documentation

To integrate a service, read the API documentation for the selected workflows.
Scope endpoint and parameter coverage to those workflows, but read the
cross-cutting concerns (auth, rate limits, error handling, data models) in full
— they apply across every tool you expose:

- Official API reference documentation
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Rate limiting and pagination patterns
- Error responses and status codes
- Available endpoints and their parameters
- Data models and schemas

Use web search or WebFetch only for documentation gaps that block the selected
workflow.

#### 1.5 Create an Implementation Plan

Create a plan with these sections:

**Tool Selection:**

- List the most valuable endpoints/operations to implement
- Prioritize tools that enable the most common and important use cases
- Consider which tools work together to enable complex workflows

**Shared Utilities and Helpers:**

- Identify common API request patterns
- Plan pagination helpers
- Design filtering and formatting utilities
- Plan error handling strategies

**Input/Output Design:**

- Define input validation models (Pydantic for Python, Zod for TypeScript)
- Design consistent response formats (e.g., JSON or Markdown), and configurable levels of detail (e.g., Detailed or Concise)
- Plan for large-scale usage (thousands of users/resources)
- Implement character limits and truncation strategies (e.g., 25,000 tokens)

**Error Handling Strategy:**

- Plan graceful failure modes
- Define each error shape with: error code, human-readable cause, retryability,
  and next valid action.
- Consider rate limiting and timeout scenarios
- Handle authentication and authorization errors

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

After the plan exists, implement the shared infrastructure before individual
tools.

#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure

**For Python:**

- Create a single `.py` file or organize into modules if complex (see [🐍 Python Guide](./references/python_mcp_server.md))
- Use the MCP Python SDK for tool registration
- Define Pydantic models for input validation

**For Node/TypeScript:**

- Create the project structure from [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./references/node_mcp_server.md)
- Set up `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`
- Use MCP TypeScript SDK
- Define Zod schemas for input validation

#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure First

**To begin implementation, create shared utilities before implementing tools:**

- API request helper functions
- Error handling utilities
- Response formatting functions (JSON and Markdown)
- Pagination helpers
- Authentication/token management

#### 2.3 Implement Tools Systematically

For each tool in the plan:

**Define Input Schema:**

- Use Pydantic (Python) or Zod (TypeScript) for validation
- Include constraints (min/max length, regex patterns, min/max values, ranges)
- Describe field purpose, accepted values, and defaults
- Include diverse examples in field descriptions

**Write Tool Docstrings/Descriptions:**

- One-line summary of what the tool does
- Purpose and functionality
- Explicit parameter types with examples
- Return type schema
- Usage examples (when to use, when not to use)
- Error handling documentation, which outlines how to proceed given specific errors

**Implement Tool Logic:**

- Use shared utilities to avoid code duplication
- Follow async/await patterns for all I/O
- Implement the planned error shapes
- Support multiple response formats (JSON and Markdown)
- Respect pagination parameters
- Check character limits and truncate appropriately

**Add Tool Annotations:**

- `readOnlyHint`: true (for read-only operations)
- `destructiveHint`: false (for non-destructive operations)
- `idempotentHint`: true (if repeated calls have same effect)
- `openWorldHint`: true (if interacting with external systems)

#### 2.4 Follow Language-Specific Best Practices

**At this point, load the appropriate language guide:**

**For Python: Load [🐍 Python Implementation Guide](./references/python_mcp_server.md) and ensure the following:**

- Using MCP Python SDK with proper tool registration
- Pydantic v2 models with `model_config`
- Type hints throughout
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Proper imports organization
- Module-level constants (CHARACTER_LIMIT, API_BASE_URL)

**For Node/TypeScript: Load [⚡ TypeScript Implementation Guide](./references/node_mcp_server.md) and ensure the following:**

- Using `server.registerTool` properly
- Zod schemas with `.strict()`
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No `any` types - use proper types
- Explicit Promise<T> return types
- Build process configured (`bun run build`)

---

### Phase 3: Review and Refine

After initial implementation:

#### 3.1 Code Quality Review

Review the code for:

- **DRY Principle**: No duplicated code between tools
- **Composability**: Shared logic extracted into functions
- **Consistency**: Similar operations return similar formats
- **Error Handling**: All external calls have error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full type coverage (Python type hints, TypeScript types)
- **Documentation**: Every tool has summary, parameters, return shape, examples,
  and error behavior

#### 3.2 Test and Build

**Important:** MCP servers are long-running processes that wait for requests over stdio/stdin or sse/http. Running them directly in your main process (e.g., `python server.py` or `node dist/index.js`) will cause your process to hang indefinitely.

**Safe ways to test the server:**

- Use the evaluation harness (see Phase 4)
- Run the server in tmux to keep it outside your main process
- Use a timeout when testing: `timeout 5s python server.py`

**For Python:**

- Verify Python syntax: `python -m py_compile your_server.py`
- Check imports work correctly by reviewing the file
- To manually test: Run server in tmux, then test with evaluation harness in main process
- Or use the evaluation harness directly (it manages the server for stdio transport)

**For Node/TypeScript:**

- Run `bun run build` and ensure it completes without errors
- Verify dist/index.js is created
- To manually test: Run server in tmux, then test with evaluation harness in main process
- Or use the evaluation harness directly (it manages the server for stdio transport)

#### 3.3 Use Quality Checklist

To verify implementation quality, load the appropriate checklist from the language-specific guide:

- Python: see "Quality Checklist" in [🐍 Python Guide](./references/python_mcp_server.md)
- Node/TypeScript: see "Quality Checklist" in [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./references/node_mcp_server.md)

### Phase 4: Create Evaluations

After implementing the MCP server, create evaluations that test whether agents
can answer realistic questions with the tools.

**Load [✅ Evaluation Guide](./references/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.**

#### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose

Evaluations test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.

#### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions

Follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide:

1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities
2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data
3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions
4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers

#### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements

Each question must be:

- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions
- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required
- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration
- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about
- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison
- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time

#### 4.4 Output Format

Create an XML file with this structure:

```xml
<evaluation>
  <qa_pair>
    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames. One model needed a specific safety designation that uses the format ASL-X. What number X was being determined for the model named after a spotted wild cat?</question>
    <answer>3</answer>
  </qa_pair>
<!-- More qa_pairs... -->
</evaluation>
```

## Gotchas

- **Running the server directly hangs the process.** MCP servers block on stdio/stdin waiting for requests indefinitely. Never run `python server.py` or `node dist/index.js` in your main process. Use `tmux` to background the server, or use the evaluation harness which manages the server subprocess.
- **Live URL references can go stale.** The MCP protocol documentation URL (`modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt`) and the GitHub SDK README URLs may move between versions. If a WebFetch fails, search for the current URL rather than assuming the skill path is correct.
- **TypeScript builds must be re-run after every source change.** `dist/index.js` is the artifact the MCP runtime loads. Editing `.ts` files without running `bun run build` means the runtime is still running the old version.
- **Tool annotations are hints, not enforced contracts.** `readOnlyHint: true` does not prevent a tool from writing data — it only signals intent to the LLM. Enforce safety in the tool implementation itself.
