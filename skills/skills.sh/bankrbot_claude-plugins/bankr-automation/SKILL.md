# Bankr Automation

Set up automated orders and scheduled trading strategies.

## Order Types

### Limit Orders
Execute at target price:
- "Set a limit order to buy ETH at $3,000"
- "Limit order: sell BNKR when it hits $0.02"

### Stop Loss Orders
Automatically sell to limit losses:
- "Set stop loss for my ETH at $2,500"
- "Stop loss: sell 50% of BNKR if it drops 20%"

### DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)
Invest fixed amounts at regular intervals:
- "DCA $100 into ETH every week"
- "Set up daily $50 Bitcoin purchases"

### TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
Spread large orders over time:
- "TWAP: buy $1000 of ETH over 24 hours"
- "Spread my sell order over 4 hours"

### Scheduled Commands
Run any Bankr command on a schedule:
- "Every morning, check my portfolio"
- "At 9am daily, check ETH price"

## Managing Automations

**View:**
- "Show my automations"
- "What limit orders do I have?"

**Cancel:**
- "Cancel my ETH limit order"
- "Stop my DCA into Bitcoin"

## Chain Support

- **EVM Chains** (Base, Polygon, Ethereum): All order types supported
- **Solana**: Uses Jupiter Trigger API for limit orders, stop loss, and DCA

## Common Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Order not triggering | Check price threshold |
| Insufficient balance | Ensure funds available when order executes |
| Order cancelled | May expire or conflict with other orders |

## Tips

1. Start small - test with small amounts first
2. Set alerts - get notified on execution
3. Review regularly - update orders as market changes
4. Combine strategies - DCA + stop loss works well
5. Factor in fees - consider per-transaction costs for DCA
