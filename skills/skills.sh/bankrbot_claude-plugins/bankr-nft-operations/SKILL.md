# Bankr NFT Operations

Browse, purchase, and manage NFTs across chains via OpenSea integration.

**Supported Chains**: Base, Ethereum, Polygon

## Operations

- **Browse** - Search NFT collections
- **View Listings** - Find best deals and floor prices
- **Buy** - Purchase NFTs from marketplace listings
- **View Holdings** - Check your NFT portfolio
- **Transfer** - Send NFTs to another wallet
- **Mint** - Mint from supported platforms (Manifold, SeaDrop)

## Prompt Examples

**Browse NFTs:**

**View listings:**
- "What's the floor price for Pudgy Penguins?"
- "Show cheapest NFTs in Azuki collection"

**Buy NFTs:**
- "Buy the cheapest Bored Ape"
- "Purchase this NFT: [OpenSea URL]"

**View holdings:**
- "Show my NFTs"
- "What NFTs do I own on Ethereum?"

## Collection Resolution

Bankr resolves common names and abbreviations:

| Input | Resolved |
|-------|----------|
| "Bored Apes" / "BAYC" | boredapeyachtclub |
| "Pudgy Penguins" | pudgypenguins |
| "CryptoPunks" | cryptopunks |

## Chain Considerations

- **Ethereum**: Most valuable collections, higher gas
- **Base**: Growing ecosystem, very low gas
- **Polygon**: Low gas, gaming NFTs

## Common Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Collection not found | Try alternative names |
| NFT already sold | Try another listing |
| Insufficient funds | Check balance |
| High gas | Wait or try L2 |

## Safety Tips

- Verify collection through official links
- Check floor price to avoid overpaying
- Look for verified collections
- Factor in gas costs
