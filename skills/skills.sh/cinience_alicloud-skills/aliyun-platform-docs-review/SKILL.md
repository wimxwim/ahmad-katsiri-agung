# Alibaba Cloud Product Docs + API Docs Reviewer

Use this skill when the user gives a product name and asks for an end-to-end documentation/API quality review.

## What this skill does

1) Resolve product from latest OpenAPI metadata.
2) Fetch latest API docs for default version.
3) Discover product/help-doc links from official product page.
4) Produce a structured review report with:
- score
- evidence
- prioritized suggestions (P0/P1/P2)

## Workflow

Run the bundled script:

```bash
python skills/platform/docs/aliyun-platform-docs-review/scripts/review_product_docs_and_api.py --product "<product name or product code>"
```

Example:

```bash
python skills/platform/docs/aliyun-platform-docs-review/scripts/review_product_docs_and_api.py --product "ECS"
```

## Output policy

All generated artifacts must be written under:

`output/aliyun-platform-docs-review/`

For each run, the script creates:

- `review_evidence.json`
- `review_report.md`

## Reporting guidance

When answering the user:

1) State resolved product + version first.
2) Summarize the score and the top 3 issues.
3) List P0/P1/P2 recommendations with concrete actions.
4) Provide source links used in the report.

## Validation

```bash
mkdir -p output/aliyun-platform-docs-review
for f in skills/platform/docs/aliyun-platform-docs-review/scripts/*.py; do
  python3 -m py_compile "$f"
done
echo "py_compile_ok" > output/aliyun-platform-docs-review/validate.txt
```

Pass criteria: command exits 0 and `output/aliyun-platform-docs-review/validate.txt` is generated.

## Output And Evidence

- Save artifacts, command outputs, and API response summaries under `output/aliyun-platform-docs-review/`.
- Include key parameters (region/resource id/time range) in evidence files for reproducibility.

## Prerequisites

- Configure least-privilege Alibaba Cloud credentials before execution.
- Prefer environment variables: `ALIBABACLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `ALIBABACLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`, optional `ALIBABACLOUD_REGION_ID`.
- If region is unclear, ask the user before running mutating operations.
