# SEO Optimizer

## Overview

Perform comprehensive SEO analysis and optimization covering keyword placement, readability metrics, technical elements, and content quality to improve search engine rankings and user experience.

## When to Use

- Optimizing blog posts or articles for search rankings
- Conducting content audits
- Improving existing content performance
- Planning new content with SEO in mind
- Analyzing competitor content strategies
- Preparing content for publication

## Core Analysis Areas

### 1. Target Keywords Analysis

- Identify primary and secondary keywords
- Check placement in title, H1, first 100 words, subheadings
- Calculate keyword density (target: 1-2%)
- Identify LSI keywords and semantic variations
- Flag keyword stuffing issues

### 2. Content Structure

- Verify heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Check keyword usage in headings
- Evaluate paragraph length (target: <150 words)
- Assess overall scannability
- Review content organization

### 3. Readability Metrics

```javascript
// Readability scoring example
const readabilityMetrics = {
  fleschScore: 65,           // Target: 60-70
  gradeLevel: 8,             // Target: 7-9
  avgSentenceLength: 18,     // Target: <20 words
  passiveVoice: 5,           // Target: <10%
  transitionWords: 30        // Target: >30%
};
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Flesch Reading Ease score (60-70 ideal)
- Grade level estimation
- Average sentence length (<20 words)
- Passive voice percentage (minimize)
- Transition word usage

### 4. Technical SEO Elements

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Meta Title | 50-60 characters with primary keyword |
| Meta Description | 150-160 characters, compelling with keyword |
| URL Slug | Short, keyword-rich, hyphen-separated |
| Image Alt Text | Descriptive with natural keyword usage |
| Internal Links | Link to related content with keyword anchors |
| External Links | Quality outbound links to authoritative sources |

### 5. Content Quality Assessment

- Word count adequacy (1500+ for competitive topics)
- Content depth and topic coverage
- Unique value proposition
- E-A-T signals (Expertise, Authority, Trustworthiness)
- Content freshness (current examples, recent data)
- Clear answer to user intent

### 6. Provide Actionable Recommendations

Organize findings into prioritized action items based on impact and implementation effort.

## Priority Levels
