# Design Review Skill

**Status**: Production Ready ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-20
**Dependencies**: Playwright MCP or Chrome DevTools
**Methodology**: 7-phase systematic review (inspired by Stripe, Airbnb, Linear)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites Check

Before starting a design review, verify browser automation tools are available:

**Option A: Playwright MCP** (recommended for interactive testing)
- See the `playwright-testing` skill for Playwright setup
- Provides browser automation, screenshots, viewport testing, console monitoring

**Option B: Chrome DevTools CLI** (alternative for screenshots and performance)
- See the `chrome-devtools` skill for Puppeteer CLI setup
- Provides screenshot capture, performance analysis, network monitoring

For complete browser tools reference, see [references/browser-tools-reference.md](references/browser-tools-reference.md).

### 2. Understand the Review Scope

**For PR reviews:**
```bash
# Analyze git diff to understand scope
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD

# Read PR description for context
```

**For general UI reviews:**
Simply provide the preview URL and component/page description.

### 3. Execute 7-Phase Review

Follow the systematic checklist below. Each phase has specific objectives and testing procedures.

---

## The 7-Phase Review Methodology

### Phase 0: Preparation

**Objective:** Understand context and set up testing environment.

**Steps:**
1. **Read PR description** or review request to understand:
   - Motivation for changes
   - Scope of implementation
   - Testing notes from developer
   - Expected behavior

2. **Analyze code diff** (if PR available):
   ```bash
   git diff origin/main...HEAD
   ```
   Identify modified files (components, styles, tests)

3. **Set up live preview environment:**
   - Navigate to preview URL using browser tools
   - Set initial viewport: 1440x900 (desktop)
   - Take baseline screenshot for reference

4. **Review design principles** (if project has custom guidelines):
   - Check project CLAUDE.md for design standards
   - Review component library documentation
   - Note design system tokens and patterns

**When to skip:** For quick component reviews without git context.

---

### Phase 1: Interaction & User Flow

**Objective:** Verify the interactive experience works as expected.

**For complete interaction guide**: Load `references/interaction-patterns.md` when testing interactive states, forms, buttons, navigation flows, micro-interactions, modals, or keyboard navigation.

**Quick checklist:**
- Test 5 interactive states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled) for all elements
- Execute primary user flow (form submission, navigation, key actions)
- Verify destructive actions have confirmation dialogs
- Assess perceived performance (loading states, optimistic UI)

**Triage:** [Blocker] Critical flow broken | [High] Poor UX/missing focus states | [Medium] Missing polish | [Nitpick] Minor timing issues

---

### Phase 2: Responsiveness Testing

**Objective:** Ensure design works across all viewport sizes.

**For complete responsive guide**: Load `references/responsive-testing.md` when testing viewports, touch targets, mobile navigation, image responsiveness, or debugging horizontal scrolling.

**Test 3 viewports:**
- **Desktop (1440px)**: Optimal layout, full feature set
- **Tablet (768px)**: Graceful adaptation, 44×44px touch targets, collapsing nav
- **Mobile (375px)**: No horizontal scroll, 16px min text, mobile-friendly navigation

**Quick testing:**
```bash
mcp__playwright__browser_resize(width: 1440, height: 900)  # Desktop
mcp__playwright__browser_resize(width: 768, height: 1024)  # Tablet
mcp__playwright__browser_resize(width: 375, height: 667)   # Mobile
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot(fullPage: true)
```

**Triage:** [Blocker] Layout broken | [High] Horizontal scroll/overlapping | [Medium] Suboptimal spacing | [Nitpick] Minor inconsistencies

---

### Phase 3: Visual Polish

**Objective:** Assess aesthetic quality and visual consistency.

**For design principles guide**: Load `references/visual-polish.md` when evaluating typography hierarchy, spacing/layout, color palette, alignment/grid, visual hierarchy, image quality, or S-Tier design standards.

**Quick evaluation (5 criteria):**
1. **Layout & spacing**: Grid alignment, 8px scale, design tokens (no magic numbers like 17px)
2. **Typography**: Clear H1>H2>H3 hierarchy, 1.5-1.7 line height, limited font weights
3. **Color**: Design system tokens, semantic usage (red=error, green=success), consistent brand
4. **Images**: High-res (no pixelation), correct aspect ratios, optimized sizes, alt text
5. **Visual hierarchy**: Primary actions stand out, eye flows naturally, strategic whitespace

**Triage:** [Blocker] Illegible text/broken images | [High] Obvious inconsistencies | [Medium] Spacing/alignment issues | [Nitpick] Aesthetic preferences

---

### Phase 4: Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Objective:** Ensure inclusive design for all users.

**For complete WCAG 2.1 AA checklist**: Load `references/accessibility-wcag.md` when verifying WCAG compliance, testing keyboard navigation, checking color contrast, auditing semantic HTML, or using accessibility testing tools (Lighthouse, axe, WAVE).

**Quick WCAG tests (4 principles):**

1. **Perceivable**: Alt text on images, color contrast (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI components), semantic HTML
2. **Operable**: Keyboard navigation (Tab order logical, visible focus on ALL interactive elements, Enter/Space activation, Escape closes modals, no keyboard traps)
3. **Understandable**: Clear labels, helpful error messages, consistent navigation/terminology
4. **Robust**: Valid HTML, proper ARIA attributes (roles, states, properties)

**Critical tests:**
- Tab through entire page (verify focus states visible, logical order, no traps)
- Test with WebAIM Contrast Checker (all text/UI ≥4.5:1 or 3:1)
- Verify form labels associated with inputs (`<label for="id">` or `aria-label`)
- Check semantic HTML (h1→h2→h3 no skipping, `<button>` not `<div onClick>`)

**Triage:** [Blocker] No keyboard access to core features | [High] WCAG AA violations | [Medium] Semantic HTML issues | [Nitpick] Enhanced accessibility

---

### Phase 5: Robustness Testing

**Objective:** Verify handling of edge cases and error conditions.

**Test scenarios:**

#### 5.1 Form Validation

- Submit form with empty required fields
- Enter invalid data (wrong email format, out-of-range numbers)
- Test field-level validation (real-time feedback)
- Verify clear error messages with guidance
- Test successful submission flow (confirmation message)

#### 5.2 Content Overflow

- **Long text strings**: Very long names, emails, titles
- **Many items**: Large lists, tables with hundreds of rows
- **Deeply nested content**: Comments with many replies
- **Empty states**: No data to display (show helpful message)

**Common overflow issues:**
- Text breaking layout (overflowing containers)
- Truncation without ellipsis or tooltip
- Performance issues with large lists
- Missing empty state designs

#### 5.3 Loading & Error States

- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens, spinners, progress indicators
- **Error messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Retry mechanisms**: Allow user to retry failed operations
- **Timeout handling**: Graceful handling of slow/failed requests
- **Optimistic updates**: Immediate feedback, rollback on failure

**Test procedure:**
```bash
# Simulate slow network
# Check browser DevTools Network tab → throttling

# Force error states
# Test with invalid API responses or network failures
```

**Common problems:**
- No loading indicators (appears frozen)
- Vague error messages ("Error occurred")
- No retry mechanism after failures
- Layout jumps when content loads

**Triage priorities:**
- **[Blocker]** Crashes or complete failures under edge cases
- **[High]** Poor error handling or confusing states
- **[Medium]** Missing edge case handling or minor issues
- **[Nitpick]** Loading state aesthetics or minor polish

---

### Phase 6: Code Health

**Objective:** Ensure maintainable, consistent implementation.

**For code patterns guide**: Load `references/code-health-patterns.md` when evaluating component reuse (DRY principle), design token usage (colors, spacing, typography), pattern consistency (naming, file structure, API patterns), or identifying red flags (duplication, magic numbers, broken abstractions).

**Quick review (3 criteria):**
1. **Component reuse**: No copy-paste, shared components extracted, composition over duplication
2. **Design tokens**: CSS variables for colors/spacing/typography (no magic numbers like `margin: 17px`), border radii consistent
3. **Pattern consistency**: Follows codebase patterns, naming conventions match, file structure organized

**Triage:** [High] Introduces tech debt/breaks patterns | [Medium] Missed reuse opportunities | [Nitpick] Code style preferences

---

### Phase 7: Content & Console

**Objective:** Verify polished details and technical correctness.

#### 7.1 Content Review

**Check for:**
- **Grammar and spelling**: No typos or grammatical errors
- **Clarity**: Labels and instructions are unambiguous
- **Tone consistency**: Matches brand voice (formal/casual)
- **Placeholder text**: Replaced with real content (no "Lorem ipsum")
- **Microcopy quality**: Helpful error messages, button labels, tooltips

**Common content issues:**
- Typos in UI text
- Placeholder text left in production
- Vague labels ("Submit" vs "Save Changes")
- Inconsistent terminology
- Unhelpful error messages ("Error" vs "Email format invalid")

#### 7.2 Console Check

**Test procedure:**
```bash
# Using Playwright MCP
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages()

# Using Chrome DevTools
# Open DevTools → Console tab
```

**Look for:**
- **JavaScript errors**: Uncaught exceptions, null references
- **React warnings**: Key prop warnings, lifecycle issues
- **Network failures**: Failed API requests, 404s
- **Deprecation warnings**: Old API usage warnings
- **Performance warnings**: Slow renders, memory leaks

**Triage priorities:**
- **[Blocker]** Console errors breaking functionality
- **[High]** Grammar errors or confusing content in user-facing text
- **[Medium]** Console warnings or minor content issues
- **[Nitpick]** Content polish, minor console noise

## Communication Principles

### 1. Problems Over Prescriptions

Describe the **problem and its impact**, not the solution. Let the developer decide implementation.

**❌ Prescriptive (avoid):**
"Change the margin to 16px"

**✅ Problem-focused (preferred):**
"The spacing feels inconsistent with adjacent elements, creating visual clutter that distracts from the primary CTA. The current spacing breaks the established rhythm of the design system."

### 2. Triage Matrix

Categorize **every issue** with clear priority:

| Priority | Criteria | Action Required |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **[Blocker]** | Critical failures, core functionality broken, critical accessibility violations | Must fix before merge |
| **[High-Priority]** | Significant UX issues, obvious design inconsistencies, WCAG violations | Should fix before merge |
| **[Medium-Priority]** | Improvements, minor inconsistencies, edge case handling | Consider for follow-up PR |
| **[Nitpick]** | Aesthetic preferences, minor polish, subjective opinions | Optional refinements |

**Important:** Prefix all nitpicks with "Nit:" to signal low priority.

### 3. Evidence-Based Feedback

Always provide **screenshots** for visual issues. Screenshots should:
- Show the problem clearly
- Include relevant context (surrounding elements)
- Indicate what to look at (arrows, highlights if needed)

**Example:**
```markdown
### [High-Priority] Poor contrast on disabled button

**Problem:** Disabled button text has insufficient contrast (2.1:1), failing WCAG AA
standard (requires 4.5:1). Users with low vision may not recognize the button as disabled.

**Screenshot:** [Attach screenshot showing disabled button]

**Impact:** Accessibility violation, potential confusion for users with visual impairments.
```

### 4. Start with Positives

Always acknowledge what works well before listing issues. This:
- Shows you recognize good work
- Provides balanced feedback
- Maintains positive collaboration

**Example:**
```markdown
### Design Review Summary

The new checkout flow shows excellent attention to user experience. The step indicator
is clear and well-designed, error messages are helpful and actionable, and the overall
layout feels spacious and uncluttered. The loading states with skeleton screens are
particularly well-executed. Great work on the form validation feedback!

However, there are a few accessibility and responsiveness issues to address before merge...
```

## Known Issues Prevention

This skill prevents **8** documented design review issues:

| Issue | Problem | Impact | Prevention |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| **#1: Missing Accessibility** | Reviews focus only on visual appearance, ignoring keyboard navigation and screen readers | WCAG violations shipped to production, excluding users with disabilities | Phase 4 enforces complete WCAG 2.1 AA checklist with keyboard testing |
| **#2: Incomplete Responsive Testing** | Reviewing only at desktop viewport, missing mobile breakage | Broken mobile layouts, frustrated mobile users | Phase 2 requires testing at 1440px, 768px, and 375px viewports |
| **#3: Vague Feedback** | Comments like "looks off" without screenshots or specifics | Wasted time, unclear action items, frustrated developers | Evidence-based feedback principle requires screenshots |
| **#4: Prescriptive Solutions** | Dictating implementation ("change margin to 16px") instead of describing UX impact | Design-dev friction, missed better solutions | "Problems Over Prescriptions" principle enforced |
| **#5: No Triage Priority** | All feedback treated equally, blocking merges on nitpicks | Slowed delivery, unclear priorities | Triage matrix (Blocker/High/Medium/Nitpick) required |
| **#6: Skipped Edge Cases** | Happy path works, but error states and overflow break layout | Production bugs with edge cases | Phase 5 mandates robustness testing |
| **#7: Console Errors Ignored** | Visual design passes, but JavaScript errors exist in console | Runtime failures, poor user experience | Phase 7 requires console check |
| **#8: Inconsistent Methodology** | Ad-hoc reviews miss critical areas depending on reviewer mood | Incomplete reviews, missed issues | 7-phase checklist ensures comprehensive, repeatable reviews |
