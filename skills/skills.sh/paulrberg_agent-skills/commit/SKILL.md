# Git Commit

Create atomic commits by staging the right files, analyzing the staged diff, composing a commit message, and optionally pushing.

## Workflow

### 1) Parse arguments

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

- Flags:
  - `--all` commit all changes
  - `--staged` commit exactly the current index; do not auto-stage or unstage (conflicts with `--all`)
  - `--natural` force Natural Language Format
  - `--push` push after commit
  - `--close <issue_numbers>` append `Closes #N` trailers for listed issues (comma/space-separated)
- Value arguments:
  - Conventional Prefix Format: type keyword overrides inferred type
  - Natural Language Format: leading verb/category keyword overrides inferred verb
  - Quoted text overrides inferred description or subject

Pass `--natural` through to the prepare helper when requested. The helper resolves the message format from the target repository cwd.

### 2) Prepare staged diff

Run the portable helper from the target repository cwd. Never `cd` into the skill directory, and never use dynamic `!` shell injection.

Resolve `<skill-dir>` from the loaded `SKILL.md` path:

```bash
bash "<skill-dir>/scripts/prepare-commit.sh" [--all] [--staged] [--natural] [--diff summary|full] -- [session_modified_paths...]
```

Use `--diff summary` by default. Use `--diff full` only when the intent is ambiguous.

The helper performs Git preflight checks, stages `--all` or the session-modified paths (or, with `--staged`, leaves the current index untouched), unstages unrelated pre-staged paths, rejects empty staged diffs, and prints the message format, branch, staged name-status, shortstat, and optional full diff. If it fails, stop with its error and a concise suggested fix.

- If `--all`:
  - Include all tracked, untracked, modified, deleted, and already staged changes
- If `--staged`:
  - Commit exactly what is already staged; pass no session paths. The helper neither stages nor unstages. Conflicts with `--all`.
- Otherwise (atomic commits):
  - Session-modified files = files edited in this session
  - Pass every session-modified path after `--`
  - The helper stages only those paths and unstages unrelated pre-staged paths
- **Unrelated changes**: session-modified files may contain pre-existing uncommitted changes (hunks not from this session). Include the entire file—partial staging is impractical. Never revert, discard, or `git checkout` unrelated changes.

### 3) Analyze + compose message

Read the helper output and produce the commit message in a single pass.

**Message format** — use the `## message format` value from the helper output.

- If `conventional`: read [references/conventional-prefix-format.md](references/conventional-prefix-format.md).
- If `natural`: read [references/natural-language-format.md](references/natural-language-format.md).

Read only the selected format reference before composing the message.

**Unrelated hunks** — ignore pre-existing changes when determining type/scope/description. If unrelated changes are in the same file as session changes, they are included in the commit scope but should not influence the message.

**Issue linking** — scan the chat transcript for GitHub issue references (e.g. `#123`, `owner/repo#123`, issue URLs) that the current changes resolve. For each match, append a `Closes #N` trailer. Skip issues merely mentioned in passing; include only ones the commit actually closes.

**Analysis** — perform semantic analysis of the staged diff:

- Detect breaking changes
- Infer Conventional Prefix Format scope or Natural Language context from code structure even when the path isn't clear
- Follow the selected reference's body and breaking-change rules

**If `--close`:**

- Append a `Closes #N` line for each issue number provided
- Multiple issues: one `Closes #N` per line in the body/trailer
- Merge with transcript-scanned issues; de-duplicate

### 4) Commit

- Use `git commit -m "subject"` (add `-m "body"` only if body is non-empty)
- Output exactly: commit hash, subject, and `N files changed` summary. Nothing else.
- Do not report branch ahead/behind counts, unpushed commits, push availability, unrelated tree state, staging steps, or pre-commit hook activity unless a command failed.
- If failed: show error + suggest fix
- **Pre-commit hook failure:** if the hook fails on unrelated/pre-existing changes (not this session's changes), retry automatically with `git commit --no-verify` — do not ask. Report the bypass in one line, noting the failure was unrelated to the staged changes. Never bypass hooks for failures caused by the session's own changes; fix those or surface the error instead.

### 5) Push (if `--push`)

- If upstream exists: `git push`
- If no upstream: `git push -u origin HEAD`
- If failed: show error + suggest fix (pull/rebase first, set upstream, check auth)
