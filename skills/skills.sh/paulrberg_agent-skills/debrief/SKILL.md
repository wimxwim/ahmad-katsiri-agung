# Debrief

Persist the current task's findings as an interactive HTML debrief at `./.ai/debriefs/<slug>/index.html`. Pick a slug from the user's task, build the page using the [`playground`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/playground) skill's conventions, and pre-populate it with concrete findings drawn from the transcript. Pass `--md` to emit a plain Markdown report at `./.ai/debriefs/<slug>/index.md` instead; Markdown mode does not require the `playground` skill.

## Arguments

- `<slug>` (optional): kebab-case folder name, e.g. `auth-security-review`. If omitted, derive a topical slug from the task — short (3-5 words), lowercase, dash-separated.
- `--md` (optional): emit a Markdown report at `<debriefs_dir>/index.md` instead of HTML. Disables the `playground` dependency.

## Prerequisites

The [`playground`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/playground) skill is required only for HTML mode (the default). With `--md`, this skill has no external dependencies. `scripts/prepare.sh` probes for `playground` only when building HTML; if missing it prints the install command and exits non-zero. Manual install:

```sh
bunx skills add anthropics/skills --skill playground --global
```

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve slug

- Use `$ARGUMENTS` if provided.
- Otherwise pick a topical kebab-case slug from the task: `auth-security-review`, `bundle-size-analysis`, `tailwind-v4-migration`, `lcp-regression-q1`. Avoid generic names (`report`, `findings`, `debrief`, `output`).
- Reject slugs that don't match `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$` — the helper script enforces this.

### 2. Prepare and verify dependencies

Run from the skill directory:

```bash
bash scripts/prepare.sh [--md] <slug>
```

The script:

- Validates the slug.
- In HTML mode (default), probes `.agents/skills/playground`, `.claude/skills/playground`, `~/.agents/skills/playground`, `~/.claude/skills/playground`. In `--md` mode the probe is skipped entirely.
- Exits `2` with the install command if `playground` is missing in HTML mode — relay the message verbatim and stop.
- Creates `./.ai/debriefs/<slug>/`.
- Prints five `KEY=VALUE` lines on stdout: `MODE`, `PLAYGROUND_DIR`, `DEBRIEFS_DIR`, `DEBRIEF_PATH`, `EXISTS`. `PLAYGROUND_DIR` is empty when `MODE=md`; `DEBRIEF_PATH` ends in `index.md` instead of `index.html`.

If `EXISTS=true`, ask the user before continuing: overwrite or pick a new slug.

### 3. Pick a playground template (HTML mode only)

Skip this step when `--md` is set.

Read `$PLAYGROUND_DIR/SKILL.md`, then load **one** template under `$PLAYGROUND_DIR/templates/` whose shape best fits the debrief:

| Debrief shape                   | Template               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Code review / audit findings    | `diff-review.md`       |
| Document or spec critique       | `document-critique.md` |
| Architecture / codebase tour    | `code-map.md`          |
| Learning, scope, knowledge gaps | `concept-map.md`       |
| Data / query exploration        | `data-explorer.md`     |
| Visual / design decisions       | `design-playground.md` |

Read only the chosen template — don't load all six. If nothing fits cleanly, pick the closest and adapt; do not invent a new template.

**Both formats:** pre-populate with concrete findings from the transcript — real paths, line numbers, severities, snippets, metrics, suggestions. Not lorem ipsum. Not placeholders. If the transcript has no findings, ask the user for the source material before writing.

### 4a. Build the debrief — HTML

Write a single HTML file to `$DEBRIEF_PATH` that satisfies playground core requirements:

- Single file. Inline all CSS and JS. No external dependencies, fonts, or CDNs.
- Live preview updating on every control change. No "Apply" button.
- Prompt output at the bottom — natural language, mentions only non-default choices, with a "Copy" button and brief "Copied!" feedback.
- Sensible defaults plus 3-5 named presets that snap controls to a cohesive combination.
- System font for UI, monospace for code/values.

For larger payloads, embed findings as a JS array literal inside one inline `<script>` at the top of the file.

### 4b. Build the debrief — Markdown (when `--md`)

Write a single Markdown file to `$DEBRIEF_PATH`. Recommended skeleton:

````md
# <Slug in Title Case>

<One- or two-sentence summary of what was investigated and the headline takeaway.>

## Findings

### <Finding title> — severity: high|medium|low

- **File:** `path/to/file.ts:42`
- **Issue:** <one-line description>

```ts
// minimal snippet showing the issue
```

**Suggestion:** <concrete fix>.

## Next steps

- [ ] <actionable item>
````

Rules:

- Keep it terse: one H3 per finding, fenced code only when the exact text matters.
- No HTML, no embedded scripts, no inline assets. Adjacent files (images, data) may live alongside in `$DEBRIEFS_DIR/` if needed.

### 5. Open

After writing `$DEBRIEF_PATH`, open it in the user's default browser. Run this unconditionally — do not skip, prompt, or wait for confirmation:

```bash
open "$DEBRIEF_PATH"
```

Then print the absolute `$DEBRIEF_PATH` so the user can locate it.

## Output

A self-contained HTML debrief at `./.ai/debriefs/<slug>/index.html` that:

- Surfaces concrete findings from the user's task.
- Lets the user explore, filter, or annotate them interactively.
- Generates a copyable prompt to act on the selected items.

With `--md`, the output is instead a plain Markdown report at `./.ai/debriefs/<slug>/index.md` containing the same findings without the interactive UI.

## Notes

- Write only under `./.ai/debriefs/<slug>/`. Never write elsewhere.
- Re-run with a different slug to keep parallel debriefs.
- Suggest the user add `.ai/debriefs/` to `.gitignore` if debriefs shouldn't be committed.
