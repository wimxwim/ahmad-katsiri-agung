# Codex Oracle

Use OpenAI Codex CLI as a **read-only oracle** — planning, review, and analysis only. Codex provides its perspective; you synthesize and present results to the user.

**Sandbox is always `read-only`**. Codex must never implement changes.

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:

- **query** — the main question or task (everything not a flag). **Required** — if empty, tell the user to provide a query and stop.
- `--reasoning <level>` — override reasoning effort (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`). Optional; default is `xhigh`.

## Prerequisites

Run the check script before any Codex invocation:

```bash
scripts/check-codex.sh
```

If it exits non-zero, display the error and stop. Use the wrapper for all `codex exec` calls:

```bash
scripts/run-codex-exec.sh
```

## Configuration

| Setting   | Default     | Override                                         |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Model     | `gpt-5.5`   | Allowlist only (see `references/codex-flags.md`) |
| Reasoning | `xhigh`     | `--reasoning <level>` or user prose              |
| Sandbox   | `read-only` | Not overridable                                  |

### Reasoning Effort

| Complexity | Effort   | Timeout  | Criteria                             |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Simple     | `low`    | 300000ms | \<3 files, quick question            |
| Moderate   | `medium` | 300000ms | 3–10 files, focused analysis         |
| Complex    | `high`   | 600000ms | Multi-module, architectural thinking |
| Maximum    | `xhigh`  | 600000ms | Full codebase, critical decisions    |

For `xhigh` tasks that may exceed 10 minutes, use `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool and set `CODEX_OUTPUT` so you can read the output later.

See `references/codex-flags.md` for full flag documentation.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse and Validate

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for query and `--reasoning`
2. Run `scripts/check-codex.sh` — abort on failure
3. Use `xhigh` reasoning effort unless `--reasoning` overrides it

### 2. Construct Prompt

Build a focused prompt from the user's query and any relevant context (diffs, file contents, prior conversation). Keep it direct — state what you want Codex to analyze and what kind of output you need. Do not implement; request analysis and recommendations only.

### 3. Execute

Invoke via the wrapper with HEREDOC. Set the Bash tool timeout per the reasoning effort table above.

```bash
EFFORT="<effort>" \
CODEX_OUTPUT="/tmp/codex-${RANDOM}${RANDOM}.txt" \
scripts/run-codex-exec.sh <<'EOF'
[constructed prompt]
EOF
```

For `xhigh`, consider `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool call, then read `CODEX_OUTPUT` when done.

### 4. Present Results

Read the output file and present with attribution:

```
## Codex Analysis

[Codex output — summarize if >200 lines]

---
Model: gpt-5.5 | Reasoning: [effort level]
```

Synthesize key insights and actionable items for the user.
