# Skill Doctor

Audit local Agent Skills catalogs and installed skill roots, then apply only narrow metadata repairs when requested.

## Arguments

- `--root PATH`: Scan this catalog or installed skill root. Repeatable. Default: current working directory.
- `--format text|json`: Select report format. Default: `text`.
- `--fix-safe`: Create missing `agents/openai.yaml` files or update mismatched `policy.allow_implicit_invocation`.
- `--include-shelved`: Include `shelved/*/SKILL.md` in metadata checks. Shelved skills are never required in `README.md`.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the skill directory, then run the helper from that directory:

   ```sh
   uv run scripts/skill-doctor.py "$ARGUMENTS"
   ```

2. Use JSON when another command or agent will consume the result:

   ```sh
   uv run scripts/skill-doctor.py --root . --format json
   ```

3. Run safe fixes only after reading the findings:

   ```sh
   uv run scripts/skill-doctor.py --root . --fix-safe
   ```

4. Re-run without `--fix-safe` after any manual edits.

## Findings

- Treat `error` findings as catalog defects that should block publishing or syncing.
- Treat `warning` findings as review-required catalog hygiene issues.
- Use `path` and `line` from JSON output for precise follow-up edits.

## Safe Fix Policy

`--fix-safe` may only:

- Create a missing `agents/openai.yaml` with `policy.allow_implicit_invocation` derived from `SKILL.md`.
- Update an existing `allow_implicit_invocation` boolean when it disagrees with `disable-model-invocation`.

Do not use the helper to rewrite frontmatter order, descriptions, README rows, `references/version.txt`, or relative links. Make those edits manually and verify with a fresh audit.

## Exit Codes

- `0`: Clean, or all requested safe fixes succeeded and no findings remain.
- `1`: Findings remain.
- `2`: Invalid arguments or unreadable environment.
- `3`: A requested safe fix failed.
