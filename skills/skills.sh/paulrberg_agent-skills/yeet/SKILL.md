# GitHub Contribution Workflows

Facilitate GitHub-based open source contribution workflows including pull requests, issues, and discussions. Emphasizes semantic analysis over mechanical operations — understand the intent and context of changes before generating titles, descriptions, or selecting templates. All generated content should be conversational and informal.

## Prerequisites

Use the first required read-only `gh` command in each workflow as authentication validation. Prefer `scripts/yeet-context.sh` when the workflow needs repository, template, discussion, label, or issue/PR thread context.

For pull request workflows, also verify:

- Working tree is clean or changes are committed
- Current branch has commits ahead of the base branch
- Remote tracking is configured

## Workflows

Each workflow is fully documented in its reference file. Load the appropriate reference based on user intent.

| Create Issue      | "create issue", "file issue" (generic repo)            | `references/create-issue.md`      |
