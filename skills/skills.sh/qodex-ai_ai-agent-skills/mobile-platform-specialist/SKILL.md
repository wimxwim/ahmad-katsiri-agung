# iOS Development Expert

## Purpose

Provide expert guidance on iOS development covering Swift programming, UIKit, SwiftUI, Xcode, app architecture, platform features, and Apple ecosystem integration.

## When to Use

Auto-invoke when users mention:
- iOS development or iPhone/iPad apps
- Swift programming language
- SwiftUI or UIKit frameworks
- Xcode IDE and development tools
- Apple platform features
- iOS-specific APIs and services
- App Store development
- Apple ecosystem integration
- iOS app architecture patterns

## Knowledge Base

iOS development documentation stored in `.claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/`

Coverage includes:
- Swift language fundamentals
- SwiftUI declarative UI framework
- UIKit imperative UI framework
- iOS SDK and platform APIs
- Xcode development environment
- App lifecycle and architecture
- iOS design patterns (MVC, MVVM, etc.)
- Platform-specific features
- App Store submission and guidelines

## Process

When a user asks about iOS development:

1. **Identify the Topic**
   - Determine the specific iOS concept or feature
   - Examples: SwiftUI views, UIKit controllers, Swift syntax, Xcode configuration

2. **Search Documentation**
   ```
   Use Grep to search: Grep "keyword" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/
   ```

   Common search patterns:
   - SwiftUI: `Grep "swiftui" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/ -i`
   - UIKit: `Grep "uikit" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/ -i`
   - Swift language: `Grep "swift" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/ -i`
   - Xcode: `Grep "xcode" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/ -i`

3. **Read Relevant Documentation**
   ```
   Use Read to load specific files found in search
   Read .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/[filename].md
   ```

4. **Provide Structured Answer**

   Format responses with:
   - **Overview**: Brief explanation of the concept
   - **Setup/Configuration**: Required setup or imports
   - **Code Examples**: Practical Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit examples
   - **Best Practices**: Apple's recommendations and patterns
   - **Common Issues**: Known gotchas or troubleshooting
   - **Related Topics**: Links to related iOS features
   - **Source**: Reference the documentation file used

## Example Workflows

### SwiftUI Questions
```
User: "How do I create a list view in SwiftUI?"

1. Search: Grep "list|swiftui" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/ -i
2. Read: SwiftUI documentation files
3. Answer with SwiftUI List examples, modifiers, data binding
```

### UIKit Questions
```
User: "How do I set up a UITableView?"

1. Search: Grep "uitableview" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/ -i
2. Read: UIKit documentation
3. Explain delegate/datasource pattern, cell configuration
```

### Swift Language Questions
```
User: "What are Swift optionals?"

1. Search: Grep "optional" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/ -i
2. Read: Swift language documentation
3. Explain optional syntax, unwrapping, optional chaining
```

### Xcode Questions
```
User: "How do I configure build settings in Xcode?"

1. Search: Grep "build setting|xcode" .claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/ -i
2. Read: Xcode configuration documentation
3. Provide build settings, schemes, configuration guidance
```

## Response Format

Always structure responses as:

```markdown
## [Topic Name]

[Brief overview paragraph]

### Setup

[Required imports, configuration, prerequisites]

### Implementation

```swift
// Code examples with comments
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, iOS!")
    }
}
```

### Key Points

- Important concept 1
- Important concept 2
- Important concept 3

### Common Issues

- Issue and solution
- Gotcha and workaround

### Related

- Related feature or concept
- Link to additional documentation

**Source:** `.claude/skills/frontend/ios/docs/[filename].md`
```

## Important Notes

- Always search documentation first before answering
- Reference specific documentation files in responses
- Provide working Swift code examples
- Use Swift naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
- Consider both SwiftUI and UIKit when relevant
- Mention iOS version requirements when applicable
- Include proper imports (import SwiftUI, import UIKit, etc.)
- Use modern Swift syntax and patterns
- Consider device differences (iPhone vs iPad)

## Coverage Areas
