# Devcontainer Diagnostic

Diagnose devcontainer and Docker development environment problems. Help create reproducible, fast-starting development environments that work consistently across VS Code, GitHub Codespaces, and team members.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Setting up a new devcontainer
- Container startup is too slow
- Configuration errors or conflicts
- Different behavior in VS Code vs Codespaces
- Multi-service development environment needed

Do NOT use this skill when:
- Writing application code
- Deploying to production
- Configuring CI/CD pipelines

## Core Principle

**Development containers should provide instant productivity. Every configuration choice affects startup time, reproducibility, and team onboarding. Make these trade-offs explicit.**

## Diagnostic States

### DV0: No Devcontainer Strategy

**Symptoms:** Manual setup, "check the README", works on one machine fails on others

**Interventions:**
- Start with pre-built devcontainer base image
- Use `assets/devcontainer-simple.md` template

### DV1: Slow Container Startup

**Symptoms:** 5+ minute startup, heavy postCreateCommand, avoiding rebuilds

**Key Questions:**
- How long does startup actually take?
- What's in postCreateCommand?
- Are you using prebuilds?

**Interventions:**
- Move npm install/pip install to Dockerfile (cached)
- Use mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/* base images
- Configure prebuilds for team repos
- Run `scripts/analyze-devcontainer.ts`

### DV2: Configuration Problems

**Symptoms:** JSON errors, VS Code won't connect, features conflicting

**Checklist:**
- [ ] devcontainer.json passes JSON validation
- [ ] Using only ONE of: image, build.dockerfile, dockerComposeFile
- [ ] Features are compatible and ordered correctly
- [ ] Extensions use correct publisher.extension-name format

### DV3: Environment Parity Issues

**Symptoms:** Works in VS Code, fails in Codespaces (or vice versa)

**Common Issues:**
| Issue | Local VS Code | Codespaces |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Docker socket | Usually available | Docker-in-Docker needed |
| Secrets | .env files work | Use Codespaces secrets |
| File watching | Native | May need polling |

### DV4: Multi-Service Complexity

**Symptoms:** Need database/cache/queue, services can't communicate

**Interventions:**
- Use Docker Compose integration
- Named volumes for persistence
- Health checks for service readiness
- Use `assets/devcontainer-compose.md` template

### DV5: Dockerfile Issues

**Symptoms:** Build failures, huge images, no caching

**Best Practices:**
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu

# Dependencies first (cached)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy deps then install (cached if deps unchanged)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Code last (changes frequently)
COPY . .
```

### DV6: Devcontainer Validated

**Indicators:**
- Startup under 2 minutes
- Works in VS Code and Codespaces
- New developers productive in 30 minutes

## Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `analyze-devcontainer.ts` | Find issues and optimizations | `deno run --allow-read scripts/analyze-devcontainer.ts` |
| `validate-dockerfile.ts` | Check Dockerfile best practices | `deno run --allow-read scripts/validate-dockerfile.ts` |
| `scan-image.ts` | Vulnerability scanning (wraps Trivy) | `deno run --allow-run scripts/scan-image.ts [image]` |

## Anti-Patterns

### The Kitchen Sink
Installing every tool "just in case" - 10+ minute startups.
**Fix:** Start minimal. Add only when needed.

### The postCreateCommand Overload
Everything in postCreateCommand - runs every time.
**Fix:** Move stable operations to Dockerfile.

### The Snowflake Container
Manual changes inside running containers.
**Fix:** ALL changes go in config files.

## Templates

- `assets/devcontainer-simple.md` - Basic single-container setup
- `assets/devcontainer-dockerfile.md` - Custom Dockerfile approach
- `assets/devcontainer-compose.md` - Multi-service setup
