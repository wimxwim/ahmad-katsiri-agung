# Code Review Diagnostic

Systematic code review catches 60-90% of defects before production, reduces maintenance costs by 40%, and serves as effective knowledge transfer. This skill provides structured review guidance for both human reviewers and AI agents.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Reviewing code before merge
- Assessing code quality
- Preparing code for PR submission
- Self-reviewing before requesting review

Do NOT use this skill when:
- Writing new code (use implementation skills)
- Designing architecture (use system-design)
- Working on requirements (use requirements-analysis)

## Core Principle

**Review effectiveness degrades sharply with PR size.** Under 400 lines: highest defect detection. 400-800 lines: 50% less effective. 800+ lines: 90% less effective.

## Quick Reference: Review Effectiveness

| Factor | Optimal | Degraded |
|--------|---------|----------|
| PR size | < 400 lines | > 800 lines |
| Review time | < 60 minutes | > 90 minutes |
| Review speed | 200-400 LOC/hour | > 500 LOC/hour |
| Reviewers | 2 | 4+ (diminishing returns) |

## Quality Pyramid

| Level | Checks | Catches | Frequency |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 1. Automated | Lint, types, unit tests, security scan | 60% | Every commit |
| 2. Integration | Integration tests, contracts, performance | 25% | Every PR |
| 3. Human Review | Design, logic, maintainability, context | 15% | Significant changes |

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Correctness

**Questions:**
- Does it solve the stated problem?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling complete?
- Are assumptions valid?

**Validation:** Test coverage, business logic, data integrity, concurrency handling

### 2. Maintainability

**Questions:**
- Is the code self-documenting?
- Can it be easily modified?
- Are abstractions appropriate?
- Is complexity justified?

**Indicators:** Clear naming, single responsibility, minimal coupling, high cohesion

### 3. Performance

**Questions:**
- Are there obvious bottlenecks?
- Is caching appropriate?
- Are queries optimized?
- Is memory managed?

**Red Flags:** N+1 queries, unbounded loops, synchronous I/O in async context, memory leaks

### 4. Security

**Questions:**
- Is input validated?
- Are secrets protected?
- Is authentication checked?
- Are permissions verified?

**Critical Checks:** No hardcoded secrets, SQL parameterized, XSS prevention, CSRF tokens

## Code Smells Checklist

### Method Level
| Smell | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Long method | > 50 lines | Extract method |
| Long parameter list | > 5 params | Parameter object |
| Duplicate code | > 10 similar lines | Extract common |
| Dead code | Never called | Remove |

### Class Level
| Smell | Symptoms | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| God class | > 1000 lines, > 20 methods | Split class |
| Feature envy | Uses other class data excessively | Move method |
| Data clumps | Same parameter groups | Extract class |

### Architecture Level
| Smell | Detection | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Circular dependencies | Dependency cycles | Introduce interface |
| Unstable dependencies | Depends on volatile modules | Dependency inversion |

## Comment Guidelines

### Comment Types

**[BLOCKING]** - Must fix before merge
- Security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks, breaking API changes

**[MAJOR]** - Should fix before merge
- Missing tests, performance issues, code duplication

**[MINOR]** - Can fix in follow-up
- Style inconsistencies, documentation typos, naming improvements

**[QUESTION]** - Seeking clarification
- Design decisions, business logic, external dependencies

### Effective Comment Pattern

```
Observation + Impact + Suggestion

Example:
"This method is 200 lines long [observation].
This makes it hard to understand and test [impact].
Consider extracting helper methods [suggestion]."
```

### Avoid
- Vague: "This could be better"
- Personal: "I don't like this"
- Nitpicky: "Missing period in comment"
- Overwhelming: 50+ minor style issues

## Review Readiness Checklist

### Before Requesting Review
- [ ] Feature fully implemented
- [ ] All tests written and passing
- [ ] Self-review performed
- [ ] No commented code or debug statements
- [ ] Coverage threshold met
- [ ] Linting clean
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR description explains problem and solution

### PR Description Should Include
- Problem statement (why this change?)
- Solution approach (how does it solve it?)
- Testing strategy (how verified?)
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Review focus areas (where to look closely?)

## Complexity Thresholds

### Cyclomatic Complexity
| Range | Classification | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 1-10 | Simple | OK |
| 11-20 | Moderate | Consider refactoring |
| 21-50 | Complex | Refactor required |
| > 50 | Untestable | Must decompose |

### Cognitive Complexity
| Range | Classification |
|-------|----------------|
| < 7 | Clear |
| 7-15 | Acceptable |
| > 15 | Confusing - refactor needed |

## Anti-Patterns

### Rubber Stamp
Approving without thorough review. "LGTM" in < 1 minute.
**Fix:** Minimum review time, required comments, random audits.

### Nitpicking
50+ style comments, missing real issues.
**Fix:** Automate style checks, focus on logic/design, limit minor comments.

### Big Bang Review
2000+ line PRs that overwhelm.
**Fix:** Stack small PRs, feature flags, review drafts early.

## Security Scanning Categories

### Severity Classification
| Level | Definition | SLA |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Critical | Remote code execution possible | Fix immediately |
| High | Data breach possible | Fix within 24 hours |
| Medium | Limited impact | Fix within sprint |
| Low | Minimal risk | Fix when convenient |

## Review Metrics

### Efficiency
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| First review turnaround | < 4 hours |
| Review cycles | < 3 |
| PR to merge time | < 24 hours |

### Quality
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Defect detection rate | > 80% |
| Post-merge defects | < 0.5 per PR |
| Review coverage | 100% |
