# MLOps & ML Security - Complete Reference (Jan 2026)

Production ML lifecycle with **modern security practices**.

This skill covers:

- **Production**: Data ingestion, deployment, drift detection, monitoring, incident response
- **Security**: Prompt injection, jailbreak defense, RAG security, output filtering
- **Governance**: Privacy protection, supply chain security, safety evaluation

1. **Data ingestion** (dlt): Load data from APIs, databases to warehouses
2. **Model deployment**: Batch jobs, real-time APIs, hybrid systems, event-driven automation
3. **Operations**: Real-time monitoring, drift detection, automated retraining, incident response

**Modern Best Practices (Jan 2026)**:

- Version everything that can change: model artifacts, data snapshots, feature definitions, prompts/configs, and agent graphs; require reproducibility, rollbacks, and audit logs (NIST SSDF: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final).
- Gate changes with evals (offline + online) and safe rollout (shadow/canary/blue-green); treat regressions in quality, safety, latency, and cost as release blockers.
- Align controls and documentation to risk posture (EU AI Act: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj; NIST AI RMF + GenAI profile: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.600-1.pdf).
- Operationalize security: threat model the full system (data, model, prompts, tools, RAG), harden the supply chain (SBOM/signing), and ship incident playbooks for both reliability and safety events.

It is execution-focused:

- Data ingestion patterns (REST APIs, database replication, incremental loading)
- Deployment patterns (batch, online, hybrid, streaming, event-driven)
- **Automated monitoring** with real-time drift detection
- **Automated retraining** pipelines (monitor → detect → trigger → validate → deploy)
- Incident handling with validated rollback and postmortems
- Links to copy-paste templates in `assets/`

## Quick Reference

| Task | Tool/Framework | Command | When to Use |
|------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Data Ingestion | dlt (data load tool) | `dlt pipeline run`, `dlt init` | Loading from APIs, databases to warehouses |
| Batch Deployment | Airflow, Dagster, Prefect | `airflow dags trigger`, `dagster job launch` | Scheduled predictions on large datasets |
| API Deployment | FastAPI, Flask, TorchServe | `uvicorn app:app`, `torchserve --start` | Real-time inference (<500ms latency) |
| LLM Serving | vLLM, TGI, BentoML | `vllm serve model`, `bentoml serve` | High-throughput LLM inference |
| Model Registry | MLflow, W&B, ZenML | `mlflow.register_model()`, `zenml model register` | Versioning and promoting models |
| Drift Detection | Statistical tests + monitors | PSI/KS, embedding drift, prediction drift | Detect data/process changes and trigger review |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana | `prometheus.yml`, Grafana dashboards | Metrics, alerts, SLO tracking |
| AgentOps | AgentOps, Langfuse, LangSmith | `agentops.init()`, trace visualization | AI agent observability, session replay |
| Incident Response | Runbooks, PagerDuty | Documented playbooks, alert routing | Handling failures and degradation |

## Use This Skill When

Use this skill when the user asks for **deployment, operations, monitoring, incident handling, or governance** for ML/LLM/agent systems, e.g.:

- "How do I deploy this model to prod?"
- "Design a batch + online scoring architecture."
- "Add monitoring and drift detection to our model."
- "Write an incident runbook for this ML service."
- "Package this LLM/RAG pipeline as an API."
- "Plan our retraining and promotion workflow."
- "Load data from Stripe API to Snowflake."
- "Set up incremental database replication with dlt."
- "Build an ELT pipeline for warehouse loading."

If the user is asking only about **EDA, modelling, or theory**, prefer:

- `ai-ml-data-science` (EDA, features, modelling, SQL transformation with SQLMesh)
- `ai-llm` (prompting, fine-tuning, eval)
- `ai-rag` (retrieval pipeline design)
- `ai-llm-inference` (compression, spec decode, serving internals)

If the user is asking about **SQL transformation (after data is loaded)**, prefer:

- `ai-ml-data-science` (SQLMesh templates for staging, intermediate, marts layers)

## Decision Tree: Choosing Deployment Strategy

```text
User needs to deploy: [ML System]
    ├─ Data Ingestion?
    │   ├─ From REST APIs? → dlt REST API templates
    │   ├─ From databases? → dlt database sources (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
    │   └─ Incremental loading? → dlt incremental patterns (timestamp, ID-based)
    │
    ├─ Model Serving?
    │   ├─ Latency <500ms? → FastAPI real-time API
    │   ├─ Batch predictions? → Airflow/Dagster batch pipeline
    │   └─ Mix of both? → Hybrid (batch features + online scoring)
    │
    ├─ Monitoring & Ops?
    │   ├─ Drift detection? → Evidently + automated retraining triggers
    │   ├─ Performance tracking? → Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
    │   └─ Incident response? → Runbooks + PagerDuty alerts
    │
    └─ LLM/RAG Production?
        ├─ Cost optimization? → Caching, prompt templates, token budgets
        └─ Safety? → See ai-mlops skill
```

## Core Concepts (Vendor-Agnostic)

- **Lifecycle loop**: train → validate → deploy → monitor → respond → retrain/retire.
- **Risk controls**: access control, data minimization, logging, and change management (NIST AI RMF: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf).
- **Observability planes**: system metrics (latency/errors), data metrics (freshness/drift), quality metrics (model performance).
- **Incident readiness**: detection, containment, rollback, and root-cause analysis.

## Do / Avoid

**Do**
- Do gate deployments with repeatable checks: evaluation pass, load test, security review, rollback plan.
- Do version everything: code, data, features, model artifact, prompt templates, configuration.
- Do define SLOs and budgets (latency/cost/error rate) before optimizing.

**Avoid**
- Avoid manual “clickops” deployments without audit trail.
- Avoid silent upgrades; require eval + canary for model/prompt changes.
- Avoid drift dashboards without actions; every alert needs an owner and runbook.

**Data**
- [data/sources.json](data/sources.json) - Curated external references

## External Resources

See `data/sources.json` for curated references on:

- Serving frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, gRPC, TorchServe, KServe, Ray Serve)
- Orchestration (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect)
- Model registries and MLOps (MLflow, W&B, Vertex AI, Sagemaker)
- Monitoring and observability (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Evidently)
- Feature stores (Feast, Tecton, Vertex, Databricks)
- Streaming & messaging (Kafka, Pulsar, Kinesis)
- LLMOps & RAG infra (vector DBs, LLM gateways, safety tools)

## Data Lake & Lakehouse

For comprehensive data lake/lakehouse patterns (beyond dlt ingestion), see **[data-lake-platform](../data-lake-platform/SKILL.md)**:

- **Table formats:** Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, Apache Hudi
- **Query engines:** ClickHouse, DuckDB, Apache Doris, StarRocks
- **Alternative ingestion:** Airbyte (GUI-based connectors)
- **Transformation:** dbt (alternative to SQLMesh)
- **Streaming:** Apache Kafka patterns

This skill focuses on **ML-specific deployment, monitoring, and security**. Use data-lake-platform for general-purpose data infrastructure.

## Recency Protocol (Tooling Recommendations)

When users ask recommendation questions about MLOps tooling, verify recency before answering.

### Trigger Conditions

- "What's the best MLOps platform for [use case]?"
- "What should I use for [deployment/monitoring/drift detection]?"
- "What's the latest in MLOps?"
- "Current best practices for [model registry/feature store/observability]?"
- "Is [MLflow/Kubeflow/Vertex AI] still relevant in 2026?"
- "[MLOps tool A] vs [MLOps tool B]?"
- "Best way to deploy [LLM/ML model] to production?"
- "What feature store should I use?"

### Minimal Recency Check

1. Start from `data/sources.json` and prefer sources with `add_as_web_search: true`.
2. If web search or browsing is available, confirm at least: (a) the tool’s latest release/docs date, (b) active maintenance signals, (c) a recent comparison/alternatives post.
3. If live search is not available, state that you are relying on static knowledge + `data/sources.json`, and recommend validation steps (POC + evals + rollout plan).

### What to Report

After searching, provide:

- **Current landscape**: What MLOps tools/platforms are popular NOW
- **Emerging trends**: New approaches gaining traction (LLMOps, GenAI ops)
- **Deprecated/declining**: Tools or approaches losing relevance
- **Recommendation**: Based on fresh data, not just static knowledge

Use this skill to **turn trained models into reliable services**, not to derive the model itself.

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
