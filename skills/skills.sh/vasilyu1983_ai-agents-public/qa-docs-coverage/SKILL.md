# QA Docs Coverage (Jan 2026) - Discovery, Freshness, and Runbook Quality

## Modern Best Practices (January 2026)

- **Docs as QA**: Treat docs as production artifacts with owners, review cadence, and CI quality gates (links/style/contracts/freshness)
- **Contract-first**: Validate OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/JSON Schema in CI; use coverage tools (Swagger Coverage / OpenAPI Coverage) to detect gaps
- **Runbook testability**: Every runbook must be executable in staging; validate with synthetic tests and incident exercises
- **Automation + observability**: Track coverage %, freshness, and drift via CI dashboards; prevent regressions via PR checklists

This skill provides operational workflows for auditing existing codebases, identifying documentation gaps, and systematically generating missing documentation. It complements [docs-codebase](../docs-codebase/SKILL.md) by providing the **discovery and analysis** layer.

**Key Principle**: Templates exist in docs-codebase. This skill tells you **what** to document and **how to find** undocumented components.

Core references: [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) (doc structure), [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) (REST), [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) (events).

## When to use

- Auditing an existing repo for missing/outdated documentation
- Adding documentation quality gates (lint/link checks/contracts/freshness) to CI/CD
- Validating runbooks for incident readiness (MTTR reduction)

## When to avoid

- Writing new documentation from scratch without a component inventory (use discovery first)
- Publishing AI-generated docs without human review and command/link verification

## Quick start

Use progressive disclosure: load only the reference file you need.

1. Discover components: [references/discovery-patterns.md](references/discovery-patterns.md)
2. Measure coverage + gaps: [references/audit-workflows.md](references/audit-workflows.md) (Phase 1-2) and [assets/coverage-report-template.md](assets/coverage-report-template.md)
3. Prioritize work: [references/priority-framework.md](references/priority-framework.md)
4. Create an actionable backlog: [assets/documentation-backlog-template.md](assets/documentation-backlog-template.md) and templates in [docs-codebase](../docs-codebase/SKILL.md)
5. Prevent regression: [references/cicd-integration.md](references/cicd-integration.md) and [references/freshness-tracking.md](references/freshness-tracking.md)

Optional (recommended scripts; run from the repo being audited):

- Local link check: `python3 frameworks/shared-skills/skills/qa-docs-coverage/scripts/check_local_links.py docs/`
- Freshness report: `python3 frameworks/shared-skills/skills/qa-docs-coverage/scripts/docs_freshness_report.py --docs-root docs/`

### Docs Folder / LLM Iteration Audit (Critical Option)

Use this when any repository has a `docs/` folder with many LLM-generated research and implementation artifacts across phases/iterations.

1. Inventory docs and classify by type (`Tutorial`, `How-to`, `Reference`, `Explanation`).
2. Detect duplicate topics and define one canonical file per topic/feature.
3. Audit claim quality:
   - external claims must include source link + verification date
   - implementation claims must map to current code or decision log
4. Enforce lifecycle metadata for non-canonical docs (`status`, `integrates_into`, `owner`, `last_verified`, `delete_by`).
5. Trim aggressively at each phase boundary: integrated drafts must be deleted on schedule; track rare retention exceptions in backlog.

Minimum QA gate for docs folders:
- block merge if a canonical doc is missing for a changed feature
- block merge if `delete_by` is passed for `integrated` docs
- block merge on broken links or stale critical docs without owner
- block merge if `AGENTS.md` or `README.md` is missing, stale, or not linked to current canonical docs

## Large Codebase Audit (100K-1M LOC)

For large codebases, the key principle is: **LLMs don't need the entire codebase - they need the right context for the current task**.

### Phase 0: Context Extraction

Before starting an audit, extract codebase context using tools:

| Tool | Command/URL | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **gitingest** | Replace "github.com" with "gitingest.com" | Quick full-repo dump |
| **repo2txt** | https://github.com/kirill-markin/repo2txt | Selective file extraction |
| **tree** | `tree -L 3 --dirsfirst -I 'node_modules|.git|dist'` | Structure overview |

### Hierarchical Audit Strategy

For monorepos and large projects, audit hierarchically:

```text
1. Root Level (Week 1)
   ├── AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md exists?
   ├── README.md quality
   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md exists?
   └── docs/ directory structure

2. Module Level (Week 2-3)
   ├── Each major directory has AGENTS.md?
   ├── API documentation complete?
   └── Service boundaries documented?

3. Component Level (Week 4+)
   ├── Individual component READMEs
   ├── Code comments quality
   └── Test documentation
```

### Cross-Platform Documentation Audit

Check for multi-tool compatibility:

```text
[ ] AGENTS.md exists (cross-platform standard)
[ ] CLAUDE.md exists or symlinked to AGENTS.md
[ ] GEMINI.md symlinked (if using Gemini)
[ ] File size under 300 lines (use @references for depth)
[ ] Subdirectory docs for each major module
```

### Large Codebase Coverage Checklist

## Core QA (Default)

### What "Docs as QA" Means

- Treat docs as production quality artifacts: they reduce MTTR, enable safe changes, and define expected behavior.
- REQUIRED doc types for reliability and debugging ergonomics:
  - "How to run locally/CI" and "how to test"
  - Operational runbooks (alerts, common failures, rollback)
  - Service contracts (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI) and schema examples
  - Known issues and limitations (with workarounds)

### Coverage Model (Risk-Based)

- Prioritize docs by impact:
  - P1: externally consumed contracts and failure behavior (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI, auth, error codes, SLOs).
  - P2: internal integration and operational workflows (events, jobs, DB schema, runbooks).
  - P3: developer reference (configs, utilities).

### Freshness Checks (Prevent Stale Docs)

- Define owners, review cadence, and a "last verified" field for critical docs.
- CI economics:
  - Block PRs only for missing/invalid P1 docs.
  - Warn for P2/P3 gaps; track via backlog.
- Run link checks and linting as fast pre-merge steps.

### Runbook Testability

- A runbook is "testable" if a new engineer can follow it and reach a measurable end state.
- Include: prerequisites, exact commands, expected outputs, rollback criteria, and escalation paths.

### Do / Avoid

**Do**:

- Keep docs close to code (same repo) and version them with changes.
- Use contracts and examples as the source of truth for integrations.

**Avoid**:

- Large ungoverned `docs/` folders with no owners and no CI gates.
- Writing runbooks that cannot be executed in a sandbox/staging environment.

## Decision Tree: Documentation Audit Workflow

```text
User needs: [Audit Type]
    ├─ Repo has a docs folder with LLM-generated research/feature docs?
    │   └─ Run Docs Folder / LLM Iteration Audit first, then apply P1/P2/P3 prioritization
    │
    ├─ Starting fresh audit?
    │   ├─ Public-facing APIs? → Priority 1: External-Facing (OpenAPI, webhooks, error codes)
    │   ├─ Internal services/events? → Priority 2: Internal Integration (endpoints, schemas, jobs)
    │   └─ Configuration/utilities? → Priority 3: Developer Reference (options, helpers, constants)
    │
    ├─ Found undocumented component?
    │   ├─ API/Controller? → Scan endpoints → Use api-docs-template → Priority 1
    │   ├─ Service/Handler? → List responsibilities → Document contracts → Priority 2
    │   ├─ Database/Entity? → Generate ER diagram → Document entities → Priority 2
    │   ├─ Event/Message? → Map producer/consumer → Schema + examples → Priority 2
    │   └─ Config/Utility? → Extract options → Defaults + descriptions → Priority 3
    │
    ├─ Large codebase with many gaps?
    │   └─ Use phase-based approach:
    │       1. Discovery Scan → Coverage Analysis
    │       2. Prioritize by impact (P1 → P2 → P3)
    │       3. Generate docs incrementally (critical first)
    │       4. Set up maintenance (PR templates, quarterly audits)
    │
    └─ Maintaining existing docs?
        └─ Check for:
            ├─ Outdated docs (code changed, docs didn't) → Update or remove
            ├─ Orphaned docs (references non-existent code) → Remove
            └─ Missing coverage → Add to backlog → Prioritize
```

- CI/CD freshness gates (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Observability dashboards and metrics
- Automated doc reminder bots

### API Documentation Validation

**Resource**: [references/api-docs-validation.md](references/api-docs-validation.md)

Validate API documentation accuracy against live behavior:

- Schema-to-docs drift detection
- Example request/response validation
- Endpoint coverage auditing
- Contract-first documentation workflows

### Runbook Testing

**Resource**: [references/runbook-testing.md](references/runbook-testing.md)

Validate operational runbooks are executable and current:

---

## Navigation: Templates

### Coverage Report Template

**Template**: [assets/coverage-report-template.md](assets/coverage-report-template.md)

Structured coverage report with:

- Executive summary (coverage %, key findings, recommendations)
- Coverage by category (API, Service, Data, Events, Infrastructure)
- Gap analysis (P1, P2, P3 with impact/effort)
- Outdated documentation tracking
- Documentation debt score
- Action plan (sprints + ongoing)

### Documentation Backlog Template

**Template**: [assets/documentation-backlog-template.md](assets/documentation-backlog-template.md)

Backlog tracking with:

- Status summary (In Progress, To Do P1/P2/P3, Blocked, Completed)
- Task organization by priority
- Templates reference (quick links)
- Effort estimates (Low < 2h, Medium 2-8h, High > 8h)
- Review cadence (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly)

---

## Output Artifacts

After running an audit, produce these artifacts:

1. **Coverage Report** - `.codex/docs/audit/coverage-report.md`
   - Overall coverage percentage
   - Detailed findings by category
   - Gap analysis with priorities
   - Recommendations and next audit date

2. **Documentation Backlog** - `.codex/docs/audit/documentation-backlog.md`
   - In Progress items with owners
   - To Do items by priority (P1, P2, P3)
   - Blocked items with resolution path
   - Completed items with dates

3. **Generated Documentation** - `.codex/docs/` (organized by category)
   - API reference (public/private)
   - Event catalog (Kafka/messaging)
   - Database schema (ER diagrams)
   - Background jobs (runbooks)

---

## Integration with Foundation Skills

This skill works closely with:

**[docs-codebase](../docs-codebase/SKILL.md)** - Provides templates for:

- [api-docs-template.md](../docs-codebase/assets/api-reference/api-docs-template.md) - REST API documentation
- [adr-template.md](../docs-codebase/assets/architecture/adr-template.md) - Architecture decisions
- [readme-template.md](../docs-codebase/assets/project-management/readme-template.md) - Project overviews
- [changelog-template.md](../docs-codebase/assets/project-management/changelog-template.md) - Release history

**Workflow**:

1. Use **qa-docs-coverage** to discover gaps
2. Use **docs-codebase** templates to fill gaps
3. Use **qa-docs-coverage** CI/CD integration to maintain coverage

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Documenting everything at once** - Prioritize by impact, document incrementally
- **Merging doc drafts without review** - Drafts must be validated by owners and runnable in practice
- **Ignoring outdated docs** - Outdated docs are worse than no docs
- **Documentation without ownership** - Assign owners for each doc area
- **Skipping the audit** - Don't assume you know what's documented
- **Blocking all PRs** - Only block for P1 gaps, warn for P2/P3

---

## Optional: AI / Automation

**Do**:

- Use AI to draft docs from code and tickets, then require human review and link/command verification.
- Use AI to propose "freshness diffs" and missing doc sections; validate by running the runbook steps.

**Avoid**:

- Publishing unverified drafts that include incorrect commands, unsafe advice, or hallucinated endpoints.

---

## Success Criteria

**Immediate (After Audit)**:

- Coverage report clearly shows gaps with priorities
- Documentation backlog is actionable and assigned
- Critical gaps (P1) identified with owners

**Short-term (1-2 Sprints)**:

- All P1 gaps documented
- Documentation coverage > 80% for external-facing components
- Documentation backlog actively managed

**Long-term (Ongoing)**:

- Quarterly audits show improving coverage (upward trend)
- PR documentation checklist compliance > 90%
- "How do I" questions in Slack decrease
- Onboarding time for new engineers decreases

## Usage Notes

**For Claude**: When auditing a codebase:

1. **Start with discovery** - Use [references/discovery-patterns.md](references/discovery-patterns.md) to find components
2. **Calculate coverage** - Compare discovered components vs existing docs
3. **Prioritize gaps** - Use [references/priority-framework.md](references/priority-framework.md) to assign P1/P2/P3
4. **Follow workflows** - Use [references/audit-workflows.md](references/audit-workflows.md) for systematic approach
5. **Use templates** - Reference docs-codebase for documentation structure
6. **Set up automation** - Use [references/cicd-integration.md](references/cicd-integration.md) for ongoing maintenance

**Remember**: The goal is not 100% coverage, but **useful coverage** for the target audience. Document what developers, operators, and integrators actually need.

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
