## Quick Reference

| Task | Tool/Command | Key Action | When to Use |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **Install from lockfile** | `npm ci`, `poetry install`, `cargo build` | Clean install, reproducible | CI/CD, production deployments |
| **Add dependency** | `npm install <pkg>`, `poetry add <pkg>` | Updates lockfile automatically | New feature needs library |
| **Update dependencies** | `npm update`, `poetry update`, `cargo update` | Updates within version constraints | Monthly/quarterly maintenance |
| **Check for vulnerabilities** | `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit` | Scans for known CVEs | Before releases, weekly |
| **View dependency tree** | `npm ls`, `pnpm why`, `pipdeptree` | Shows transitive dependencies | Debugging conflicts |
| **Override transitive dep** | `overrides` (npm), `pnpm.overrides` | Force specific version | Security patch, conflict resolution |
| **Monorepo setup** | `pnpm workspaces`, `npm workspaces` | Shared dependencies, cross-linking | Multi-package projects |
| **Check outdated** | `npm outdated`, `poetry show --outdated` | Lists available updates | Planning update sprints |

## Decision Tree: Dependency Management

```text
User needs: [Dependency Task]
    ├─ Adding new dependency?
    │   ├─ Check: Do I really need this? (Can implement in <100 LOC?)
    │   ├─ Check: Is it well-maintained? (Last commit <6 months, >10k downloads/week)
    │   ├─ Check: Bundle size impact? (Use Bundlephobia for JS)
    │   ├─ Check: Security risks? (`npm audit`, Snyk)
    │   └─ If all checks pass → Add with `npm install <pkg>` → Commit lockfile
    │
    ├─ Updating dependencies?
    │   ├─ Security vulnerability? → `npm audit fix` → Test → Deploy immediately
    │   ├─ Routine update?
    │       ├─ Patch versions → `npm update` → Safe, do frequently
    │       ├─ Minor/major → Check CHANGELOG → Test in staging → Update gradually
    │       └─ All at once → [FAIL] RISKY → Update in batches instead
    │
    ├─ Dependency conflict?
    │   ├─ Transitive dependency issue?
    │       ├─ View tree: `npm ls <package>`
    │       ├─ Use overrides sparingly: `overrides` in package.json
    │       └─ Document why override is needed
    │   └─ Peer dependency mismatch?
    │       └─ Check version compatibility → Update parent or child
    │
	├─ Monorepo project?
	│   ├─ Use pnpm workspaces (recommended default)
	│   ├─ Shared deps → Root package.json
	│   ├─ Package-specific → Package directories
	│   └─ Use Nx or Turborepo for task caching
	│
	└─ Choosing package manager?
	    ├─ New JS project → **pnpm** (recommended default) or **Bun** (often faster; verify ecosystem maturity)
	    ├─ Enterprise monorepo → **pnpm** (mature workspace support)
	    ├─ Speed-focused experimentation → **Bun** (verify ecosystem maturity)
	    ├─ Existing npm project → Migrate to pnpm or stay (check team preference)
	    ├─ Python → **uv** (fast), Poetry (mature), pip+venv (simple)
	    └─ Data science → **conda** or **uv** (faster environment setup)
```

## Navigation: Core Patterns

### Lockfile Management

**[`references/lockfile-management.md`](references/lockfile-management.md)**

Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds by recording exact versions of all dependencies (direct + transitive). Essential for preventing "works on my machine" issues.

- Golden rules (always commit, never edit manually, regenerate on changes)
- Commands by ecosystem (npm ci, poetry install, cargo build)
- Troubleshooting lockfile conflicts
- CI/CD integration patterns

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

**[`references/semver-guide.md`](references/semver-guide.md)**

Understanding version constraints (`^`, `~`, exact) and how to specify dependency ranges safely.

- SemVer format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Version constraint syntax (caret, tilde, exact)
- Recommended strategies by project type
- Cross-ecosystem version management

### Dependency Security Auditing

**[`references/security-scanning.md`](references/security-scanning.md)**

Automated security scanning, vulnerability management, and supply chain security best practices.

- Automated tools (Dependabot, Snyk, GitHub Advanced Security)
- Running audits (npm audit, pip-audit, cargo audit)
- CI integration and alert configuration
- Incident response workflows

### Dependency Selection

**[`references/dependency-selection-guide.md`](references/dependency-selection-guide.md)**

Deciding whether to add a new dependency and choosing between similar packages.

- Minimal dependencies principle (best dependency is the one you don't add)
- Evaluation checklist (maintenance, bundle size, security, alternatives)
- Choosing between similar packages (comparison matrix)
- When to reject a dependency

### Update Strategies

**[`references/update-strategies.md`](references/update-strategies.md)**

Keeping dependencies up to date safely while minimizing breaking changes and security risks.

- Update strategies (continuous, scheduled, security-only)
- Safe update workflow (check outdated, categorize risk, test, deploy)
- Automated update tools (Dependabot, Renovate, npm-check-updates)
- Handling breaking changes and rollback plans

### Monorepo Management

**[`references/monorepo-patterns.md`](references/monorepo-patterns.md)**

Managing multiple related packages in a single repository with shared dependencies.

- Workspace tools (pnpm, npm, yarn workspaces)
- Monorepo structure and organization
- Build optimization (Nx, Turborepo)
- Versioning and publishing strategies

### Transitive Dependencies

**[`references/transitive-dependencies.md`](references/transitive-dependencies.md)**

Dealing with dependencies of your dependencies (indirect dependencies).

- Viewing dependency trees (npm ls, pnpm why, pipdeptree)
- Resolving transitive conflicts (overrides, resolutions, constraints)
- Security risks and version conflicts
- Best practices (use sparingly, document, test)

### Ecosystem-Specific Guides

**[`references/ecosystem-guides.md`](references/ecosystem-guides.md)**

Language and package-manager-specific best practices.

- Node.js (npm, yarn, pnpm comparison and best practices)
- Python (pip, poetry, conda)
- Rust (cargo), Go (go mod), Java (maven, gradle)
- PHP (composer), .NET (nuget)

### Anti-Patterns

**[`references/anti-patterns.md`](references/anti-patterns.md)**

Common mistakes to avoid when managing dependencies.

- Critical anti-patterns (not committing lockfiles, wildcards, ignoring audits)
- Dangerous anti-patterns (never updating, deprecated packages)
- Moderate anti-patterns (overusing overrides, ignoring peer deps)

### Container Dependency Patterns

**[`references/container-dependency-patterns.md`](references/container-dependency-patterns.md)**

Managing dependencies in containerized environments (Docker, OCI).

- Multi-stage builds, layer caching, base image selection
- Runtime vs build dependencies, image scanning, reproducible images

### Version Conflict Resolution

**[`references/version-conflict-resolution.md`](references/version-conflict-resolution.md)**

Systematic approaches to resolving dependency version conflicts.

- Diamond dependency problems, resolution algorithms by ecosystem
- Override strategies, compatibility matrices, migration paths

### License Compliance

**[`references/license-compliance.md`](references/license-compliance.md)**

Open-source license management and compliance automation.

- License compatibility matrix, copyleft vs permissive, SPDX identifiers
- Automated scanning (FOSSA, license-checker), policy enforcement in CI

## Supply Chain Security

**[assets/automation/template-supply-chain-security.md](assets/automation/template-supply-chain-security.md)** — Production-grade dependency security covering SBOM generation (CycloneDX/SPDX), provenance and attestation (SLSA, Sigstore), vulnerability management SLAs, upgrade playbooks, and EU Cyber Resilience Act requirements.

Key rules: generate SBOM per release, sign artifacts (Sigstore/cosign), run audit scans in CI, fix critical CVEs within 24 hours, use `npm ci` (never `npm install`) in pipelines, batch non-security updates by risk level.

## AI-Generated Dependency Risks

> **WARNING**: AI coding agents can introduce vulnerable or non-existent packages at scale (Endor Labs, 2025).

### The Problem

AI tools accelerate coding but introduce supply chain risks:

- **Hallucinated packages** — AI suggests packages that don't exist (typosquatting vectors)
- **Vulnerable dependencies** — AI recommends outdated or CVE-affected versions
- **Unnecessary dependencies** — AI over-relies on packages for simple tasks

### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Treat AI-generated code as untrusted third-party input | Blindly accept AI dependency suggestions |
| Enforce same SAST/SCA scanning for AI-generated code | Skip security review for "AI-written" code |
| Verify all AI-suggested packages actually exist | Trust AI to know current package versions |
| Integrate security tools into AI workflows (MCP) | Allow AI to add dependencies without review |
| Vet MCP servers as part of supply chain | Use unvetted AI integrations |

### Validation Checklist

Before accepting AI-suggested dependencies:

- [ ] Package exists on registry (npm, PyPI, crates.io)
- [ ] Package name is spelled correctly (no typosquatting)
- [ ] Version is current and maintained
- [ ] `npm audit` / `pip-audit` shows no vulnerabilities
- [ ] Weekly downloads >1000 (established package)
- [ ] Last commit <6 months (actively maintained)

---

## Optional: AI/Automation

> **Note**: AI assists with triage but security decisions need human judgment.

- **Automated PR triage** — Categorize dependency updates by risk
- **Changelog summarization** — Summarize breaking changes in updates
- **Vulnerability correlation** — Link CVEs to affected packages

### Bounded Claims

- AI cannot determine business risk acceptance
- Automated fixes require security team review
- Vulnerability severity context needs human validation

---

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Adding new dependency | Check Bundlephobia, npm audit, weekly downloads, last commit |
| Updating dependencies | Use `npm outdated`, update in batches, test in staging |
| Security vulnerability found | Use `npm audit fix`, review CHANGELOG, test, deploy immediately |
| Monorepo setup | Use **pnpm workspaces** or Nx/Turborepo for build caching |
| Transitive conflict | Use `overrides` sparingly, document why, test thoroughly |
| Choosing JS package manager | **pnpm** (fastest, disk-efficient), **Bun** (7× faster), npm (most compatible) |
| Python environment | **uv** (10-100× faster), Poetry (mature), pip+venv (simple), conda (data science) |

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Always Commit Lockfiles

Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds across environments. Never add them to `.gitignore`.

**Exception**: Don't commit `Cargo.lock` for Rust libraries (only for applications).

### 2. Use Semantic Versioning

Use caret (`^`) for most dependencies, exact versions for mission-critical, avoid wildcards (`*`). See [`references/semver-guide.md`](references/semver-guide.md) for constraint syntax and strategies.

### 3. Audit Dependencies Regularly

Run `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / `cargo audit` weekly; fix critical vulnerabilities immediately. See [`references/security-scanning.md`](references/security-scanning.md).

### 4. Minimize Dependencies

The best dependency is the one you don't add. Ask: Can I implement this in <100 LOC? See [`references/dependency-selection-guide.md`](references/dependency-selection-guide.md).

### 5. Update Regularly

Update monthly or quarterly in batches — do not update all at once. See [`references/update-strategies.md`](references/update-strategies.md).

### 6. Use Overrides Sparingly

Only override transitive dependencies for security patches or conflicts. Document why in a comment (`// CVE-2023-xxxxx fix`). See [`references/transitive-dependencies.md`](references/transitive-dependencies.md).

## Usage Notes

**For Codex / Claude Code:**

- Use this skill when users need dependency management guidance
- Reference specific resources based on the task (lockfiles, security, updates)
- Provide ecosystem-specific guidance (Node.js, Python, Rust)
- Always recommend security audits and reproducible builds
- Encourage minimal dependencies and regular updates
- Link to templates for common configurations

**Best Practices:**

- Always commit lockfiles (except Cargo.lock for libraries)
- Use semantic versioning (caret for most deps, exact for critical)
- Audit dependencies weekly (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`)
- Update dependencies monthly or quarterly (not all at once)
- Choose package manager based on project needs (pnpm for speed, Poetry for Python apps)

---

> **Success Criteria:** Dependencies are minimal, well-maintained, secure, reproducible across environments, and regularly audited for vulnerabilities.

---

## Trend Awareness Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: When users ask recommendation questions about package managers, dependency tools, or supply chain security, you MUST use WebSearch to check current trends before answering.

### Trigger Conditions

- "What's the best package manager for [ecosystem]?"
- "What should I use for [dependency management/security]?"
- "What's the latest in dependency management?"
- "Current best practices for [npm/pnpm/Poetry]?"
- "Is [tool/approach] still relevant in 2026?"
- "[pnpm] vs [npm] vs [yarn]?"
- "Best dependency security scanner?"

### Required Searches

1. Search: `"dependency management best practices 2026"`
2. Search: `"[specific tool] vs alternatives 2026"`
3. Search: `"supply chain security trends January 2026"`
4. Search: `"[package manager] features 2026"`

### What to Report

After searching, provide:

- **Current landscape**: What dependency tools are popular NOW
- **Emerging trends**: New package managers, security tools, or patterns gaining traction
- **Deprecated/declining**: Tools/approaches losing relevance or support
- **Recommendation**: Based on fresh data, not just static knowledge

### Example Topics (verify with fresh search)

- Package managers (pnpm, npm, yarn, Poetry, uv for Python)
- Security scanning (Snyk, Dependabot, Socket.dev)
- Supply chain security (SBOM, Sigstore, SLSA)
- Monorepo tools (Nx, Turborepo, Bazel)
- Lockfile and reproducibility patterns
- Automated dependency updates (Renovate, Dependabot)

## Ops Preflight: Dependency and Toolchain Health (for LLM Agents)

Run this before build/test/edit loops to prevent avoidable churn such as `next: command not found`.

```bash
# 1) Runtime + package manager sanity
node -v
npm -v

# 2) Lockfile and install mode
ls -1 package-lock.json pnpm-lock.yaml yarn.lock 2>/dev/null
test -d node_modules || npm ci

# 3) Verify framework binaries resolve
npx next --version 2>/dev/null || echo "next missing"
npx eslint --version 2>/dev/null || echo "eslint missing"

# 4) Surface dependency graph issues early
npm ls --depth=0
```

### Remediation Rules

- If binary missing: install from lockfile, do not ad-hoc install random versions.
- If lockfile drift detected: re-install using project standard tool (`npm ci`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, etc).
- If peer dependency conflict appears, fix root cause before continuing broad edits.
- Cache these checks at session start for long agent runs.

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
