# DevOps Engineering — Quick Reference

This skill equips teams with actionable templates, checklists, and patterns for building self-service platforms, automating infrastructure with GitOps, deploying securely with DevSecOps, scaling with Kubernetes, ensuring reliability through SRE practices, and operating production systems with strong observability.

**Modern baseline (2026)**: IaC (Terraform/OpenTofu/Pulumi), GitOps (Argo CD/Flux), Kubernetes (follow upstream supported releases), OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Grafana, supply-chain security (SBOM + signing + provenance), policy-as-code (OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno), and eBPF-powered networking/security/observability (e.g., Cilium + Tetragon).

---

## Quick Reference

| Task | Tool/Framework | Command | When to Use |
|------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform / OpenTofu | `terraform plan && terraform apply` | Provision cloud resources declaratively |
| GitOps Deployment | Argo CD / Flux | `argocd app sync myapp` | Continuous reconciliation, declarative deployments |
| Container Build | Docker Engine | `docker build -t app:v1 .` | Package applications with dependencies |
| Kubernetes Deployment | kubectl / Helm (Kubernetes) | `kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml` / `helm upgrade app ./chart` | Deploy to K8s cluster, manage releases |
| CI/CD Pipeline | GitHub Actions | Define workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Automated testing, building, deploying |
| Security Scanning | Trivy / Falco / Tetragon | `trivy image myapp:latest` | Vulnerability scanning, runtime security, eBPF enforcement |
| Monitoring & Alerts | Prometheus + Grafana | Configure ServiceMonitor and AlertManager | Observability, SLO tracking, incident alerts |
| Load Testing | k6 / Locust | `k6 run load-test.js` | Performance validation, capacity planning |
| Incident Response | PagerDuty / Opsgenie | Configure escalation policies | On-call management, automated escalation |
| Platform Engineering | Backstage / Port | Deploy internal developer portal | Self-service infrastructure, golden paths |

## Cost Governance & Capacity Planning

**[assets/cost-governance/template-cost-governance.md](assets/cost-governance/template-cost-governance.md)** — Production cost control for cloud infrastructure.

### Key Sections

- **Cost Governance Framework** — Tagging strategy, budget alerts, anomaly detection
- **Cloud Cost Optimization** — Right-sizing, reserved capacity, storage tiering
- **Kubernetes Cost Control** — Resource requests/limits, quotas, autoscaler config
- **Capacity Planning** — Utilization baseline, growth projections, scaling triggers
- **FinOps Practices** — Monthly review agenda, optimization workflow

---

## Do / Avoid

### Do

- Tag all resources at creation time
- Set budget alerts before hitting limits
- Review right-sizing recommendations monthly
- Use spot/preemptible for fault-tolerant workloads
- Set Kubernetes resource requests on all pods
- Enable cluster autoscaler with scale-down
- Document capacity planning assumptions
- Run blameless postmortems after every SEV1/2

### Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| No cost tags | Can't attribute spend | Enforce tags in CI/CD |
| Dev runs 24/7 | ~70% waste | Scheduled shutdown |
| Over-provisioned | Paying for idle capacity | Monthly right-sizing review |
| No reservations | On-demand premium | 60-70% reserved coverage target |
| Alert fatigue | Real issues missed | SLO-based alerting, tuned thresholds |
| Snowflake infra | Unreproducible, undocumented | Everything in Terraform/IaC |
| Clickops drift | Config outside IaC | Enforce GitOps reconciliation |
| No postmortems | Same incidents repeat | Blameless postmortem for SEV1/2 |

## Optional: AI/Automation (AIOps)

> AI can assist with analysis and triage, but infrastructure/cost/incident decisions require human approval and an audit trail.

## Trend Awareness Protocol

When users ask recommendation questions about DevOps, platform engineering, or cloud infrastructure, validate time-sensitive details (versions, deprecations, licensing, major releases) against primary sources.

### Trigger Conditions

- "What's the best tool for [Kubernetes/IaC/CI-CD/monitoring]?"
- "What should I use for [container orchestration/GitOps/observability]?"
- "What's the latest in DevOps/platform engineering?"
- "Current best practices for [Terraform/ArgoCD/Prometheus]?"
- "Is [tool/approach] still relevant in 2026?"
- "[Kubernetes] vs [alternative]?" or "[ArgoCD] vs [FluxCD]?"
- "Best cloud provider for [use case]?"
- "What orchestration/monitoring tool should I use?"

### Minimum Verification (Preferred Order)

1. Check the official docs + release notes linked in [data/sources.json](data/sources.json) for the specific tools you recommend.
2. If internet access is available, confirm recent releases, breaking changes, and deprecations from those release pages.
3. If internet access is not available, state that versions may have changed and focus on stable selection criteria (operational fit, ecosystem, maturity, team skills, compliance).

### What to Report

After searching, provide:

- **Current landscape**: What tools/approaches are popular NOW (not 6 months ago)
- **Emerging trends**: New tools, patterns, or practices gaining traction
- **Deprecated/declining**: Tools/approaches losing relevance or support
- **Recommendation**: Based on fresh data, not just static knowledge

### Example Topics (verify with fresh search)

- Kubernetes versions and ecosystem tools (1.33+, Cilium, Gateway API)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi, CDK)
- GitOps platforms (ArgoCD, FluxCD, Codefresh)
- Observability stacks (OpenTelemetry, Grafana stack, Datadog)
- Platform engineering tools (Backstage, Port, Kratix)
- CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Dagger)
- Cloud-native security (Falco, Trivy, policy engines)

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
