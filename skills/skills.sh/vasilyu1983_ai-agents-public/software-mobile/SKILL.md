## Core Capabilities

### iOS Development

- **UI Frameworks**: SwiftUI (declarative), UIKit (imperative)
- **Architecture**: MVVM, Clean Architecture, Coordinator, TCA (Composable Architecture)
- **Concurrency**: Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors, TaskGroup); keep UI state on `@MainActor`; enable strict concurrency checks as appropriate
- **Storage**: Core Data, SwiftData, Keychain
- **Networking**: URLSession, async/await patterns
- **Platform compliance**: Privacy manifests + required-reason APIs, background execution limits, and accessibility settings (Dynamic Type, VoiceOver)
- **Defensive Decoding**: Handle missing fields, array/dict formats, snake_case/camelCase

### Android Development

- **UI Frameworks**: Jetpack Compose (declarative), Views (XML)
- **Architecture**: MVVM, Clean Architecture, MVI
- **Concurrency**: Coroutines, Flow, LiveData
- **Storage**: Room, DataStore, Keystore
- **Networking**: Retrofit, OkHttp, Ktor

### Cross-Platform Development

- **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**: Share domain/data/networking; keep native UI; consider Compose Multiplatform when shared UI is worth the constraints
- **React Native**: JavaScript/TypeScript; evaluate New Architecture readiness and native-module surface area; Expo-managed path is often fastest for greenfield apps
- **Flutter**: Dart; high code sharing; validate platform-specific gaps and plugin maturity for your requirements
- **WebView**: WKWebView (iOS), WebView (Android), JavaScript bridge

## Platform Baselines (Verify Current Requirements)

### iOS/iPadOS (Core)

- Privacy manifest files (app + embedded SDKs) are maintained and reviewed https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundlereferences/privacy_manifest_files
- Required-reason APIs are declared with valid reasons https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundlereferences/privacy_manifest_files
- Background work uses supported primitives (avoid fragile timers) https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks
- App Transport Security is configured; exceptions are justified and documented https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundlereferences/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity
- Concurrency is implemented with Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors, TaskGroup) and checked with current Swift language mode settings https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html
- Swift 6 migration / strict concurrency guidance is followed when upgrading toolchains https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/adoptingswift6
- UI/UX follows current Human Interface Guidelines (including accessibility) https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios

### Android (Core)

- Background work uses WorkManager for deferrable, guaranteed work https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager
- Network calls and auth state survive process death (no hidden singleton assumptions) [Inference]
- Target SDK meets current Google Play requirements (verify policy + deadlines) https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11926878
- Prefer Play Integrity API over deprecated SafetyNet Attestation https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity
- Prefer Credential Manager for passkeys and modern sign-in flows https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager

### Cross-Platform (Core)

- Feature parity is explicit (document what is native-only vs shared) [Inference]
- Bridges are treated as public APIs (versioned, tested, and observable) [Inference]
- React Native upgrades follow the official upgrade guide; validate New Architecture readiness against your native-module surface area https://reactnative.dev/docs/upgrading
- Expo SDK upgrades follow Expo release notes and upgrade guides https://expo.dev/changelog

### Optional: AI/Automation Extensions

> **Note**: Skip unless the app ships AI/automation features.

- iOS: Core ML / on-device inference primitives https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml
- Android: Google ML Kit https://developers.google.com/ml-kit
- Verify: model size/battery impact, offline/online behavior, user controls (cancel/undo), and privacy boundaries [Inference]

## Common Patterns

### App Startup Checklist

1. **Initialize dependencies**
   - Configure DI container (Hilt/Koin/Swinject)
   - Set up logging and crash reporting
   - Initialize analytics

2. **Check authentication state**
   - Validate stored tokens
   - Refresh if needed
   - Route to login or main screen

3. **Configure app state**
   - Load user preferences
   - Set up push notification handlers
   - Initialize deep link handling

### Offline-First Architecture

```text
1. Local-first data access
   - Always read from local database
   - Display cached data immediately
   - Show loading indicator for sync

2. Background sync
   - Queue write operations
   - Sync when connectivity available
   - Handle conflict resolution

3. Optimistic updates
   - Update UI immediately
   - Sync in background
   - Rollback on failure
```

### Push Notification Setup

```text
iOS (APNs):
1. Enable Push Notifications capability
2. Request user permission
3. Register for remote notifications
4. Handle device token
5. Implement notification delegate

Android (FCM):
1. Add Firebase to project
2. Implement FirebaseMessagingService
3. Handle notification/data messages
4. Manage notification channels (Android 8+)
5. Handle background/foreground states
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Blocking main thread | UI freezes, ANRs | Use async/coroutines for all I/O |
| Massive view controllers | Hard to test/maintain | Extract to MVVM/services |
| Hardcoded strings | No localization | Use NSLocalizedString/strings.xml |
| Ignoring lifecycle | Memory leaks, crashes | Respect activity/view lifecycle |
| No offline handling | Poor UX without network | Cache data, queue operations |
| Storing secrets in code | Security vulnerability | Use Keychain/Keystore |
| Using `decode()` without fallback | Crashes on missing/malformed API data | Use `decodeIfPresent()` with defaults |
| Missing @Bindable for @Observable | NavigationStack bindings don't work | Add `@Bindable var vm = vm` in body |

---

## Trend Awareness Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: When users ask recommendation questions about mobile development, you MUST use a web search capability (if available) to check current trends before answering. If web search is unavailable, say so and answer using `data/sources.json`, clearly flagging that the recommendation may be stale.

### Trigger Conditions

- "What's the best mobile framework for [use case]?"
- "What should I use for [cross-platform/native/hybrid]?"
- "What's the latest in iOS/Android development?"
- "Current best practices for [Swift/Kotlin/React Native]?"
- "Is [React Native/Flutter/Expo] still relevant in 2026?"
- "[React Native] vs [Flutter] vs [native]?"
- "Best approach for [offline/push/deep linking]?"

### Required Searches

1. Search: `"mobile development best practices 2026"`
2. Search: `"[iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter] updates 2026"`
3. Search: `"mobile framework comparison 2026"`
4. Search: `"[Expo/Swift/Kotlin] new features 2026"`

### What to Report

After searching, provide:

- **Current landscape**: What frameworks/approaches are popular NOW
- **Emerging trends**: New patterns or tools gaining traction
- **Deprecated/declining**: Approaches that are losing relevance
- **Recommendation**: Based on fresh data and recent releases

### Example Topics (verify with fresh search)

- Current iOS + Swift Concurrency migration guidance
- Current Play target SDK policy and identity/auth guidance
- React Native New Architecture maturity and upgrade pain points
- Expo-managed vs bare React Native tradeoffs
- Flutter vs React Native vs KMP ecosystem in 2026
- Compose Multiplatform readiness for iOS in 2026

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
