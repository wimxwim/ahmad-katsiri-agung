# QA Resilience (Jan 2026) - Failure Mode Testing & Production Hardening

This skill provides execution-ready patterns for building resilient, fault-tolerant systems that handle failures gracefully, and for validating those behaviors with tests.

Core sources are curated in `data/sources.json`.

## Common Requests

Use this skill when a user requests:

- Circuit breaker implementation
- Retry strategies and exponential backoff
- Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
- Backpressure, load shedding, and overload protection
- Timeout policies for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms
- Health check design (liveness vs readiness)
- Error handling best practices
- Chaos engineering setup
- Game days / DR / failover testing (with guardrails)
- Production hardening strategies
- Fault injection testing

**When NOT to use this skill:**

- Simple CRUD apps with no external dependencies — use basic error handling
- Single database, no network calls — standard connection pooling sufficient
- Pure batch jobs with manual retry — scheduled job frameworks handle this
- Frontend-only validation — see [software-frontend](../software-frontend/SKILL.md) instead

## Quick Start (Default Workflow)

If key context is missing, ask for: critical user journeys, dependency inventory (including third parties), SLO/SLI targets, current timeout/retry/circuit-breaker settings, idempotency/dedup strategy, and where fault injection is allowed (local/staging/prod).

1. Define scope: critical user journeys, top N dependencies, and SLOs/SLIs (latency, errors, saturation).
2. Build a dependency contract per dependency: timeout budget, retry policy (bounded + jitter), idempotency/dedup expectations, circuit breaker thresholds, and fallback/degraded behavior.
3. Choose a test harness: deterministic fault injection first (mocks/fakes, fault proxy, service mesh faults), then staged chaos experiments, then game day/DR drills if applicable.
4. Define pass/fail signals: error budget burn, p95/p99 budgets, fallback rates, queue backlog, circuit breaker state changes, and recovery time.
5. Produce artifacts (use templates): [Resilience Test Plan Template](assets/testing/template-resilience-test-plan.md), [Fault Injection Playbook](assets/testing/fault-injection-playbook.md), [Resilience Runbook Template](assets/runbooks/resilience-runbook-template.md).

## Core QA (Default)

### Failure Mode Testing (What to Validate)

- Timeouts: every network call and DB query has a bounded timeout; validate timeout budgets across chained calls and deadline/cancellation propagation.
- Retries: bounded retries with backoff + jitter; validate idempotency/dedup and retry storm safeguards (caps, budgets, and per-try timeouts).
- Dependency failure: partial outage, slow downstream, rate limiting, DNS failures, auth failures, and corrupted/invalid responses.
- Overload/saturation: connection pool exhaustion, queue backlog, thread pool starvation, and rate limiting; validate backpressure and load shedding.
- Degraded-mode UX: what the user sees/gets when dependencies fail (cached/stale/partial responses) and what consistency guarantees apply.
- Health checks: validate liveness/readiness/startup probe behavior (Kubernetes probes: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

### Right-Sized Chaos Engineering (Safe by Construction)

- Define steady state and hypothesis (Principles of Chaos Engineering: https://principlesofchaos.org/).
- Start in non-prod; in prod, use minimal blast radius, timeboxed runs, and explicit abort criteria.
- REQUIRED: rollback plan, owners, and observability signals before running experiments.
- REQUIRED (prod): change window + on-call aware, error budget healthy, and an explicit stop condition based on customer impact signals.

### Load/Perf + Production Guardrails

- Load tests validate capacity and tail latency; resilience tests validate behavior under failure.
- Guardrails:
  - Run heavy resilience/perf suites on schedule (nightly) and on canary deploys, not on every PR.
  - Gate releases on regression budgets (p99 latency, error rate, saturation) rather than on raw CPU/memory.

### Flake Control for Resilience Tests

- Chaos/fault injection can look "flaky" if the experiment is not deterministic.
- Stabilize the experiment first: fixed blast radius, controlled fault parameters, deterministic duration, strong observability.

### Debugging Ergonomics

- Every resilience test run should capture: experiment parameters, target scope, timestamps, and trace/log links for failures.
- Prefer tracing/metrics to confirm the failure is the expected one (not collateral damage).

### Do / Avoid

Do:
- Test degraded mode explicitly; document expected UX and API responses.
- Validate retries/timeouts in integration tests with fault injection.

Avoid:
- Unbounded retries and missing timeouts (amplifies incidents).
- "Happy-path only" testing that ignores downstream failure classes.

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Mechanism / Tooling | When to Use | Configuration (Starting Point) |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Circuit Breaker | App-level breaker or service mesh; emit breaker state changes | Sustained downstream failures or timeouts | Open on sustained error/timeout rates; use half-open probes; tune windows to traffic + error budget |
| Retry with Backoff | Client retry libs; respect Retry-After for 429/503 | Transient failures and rate limiting | 2-3 retries max for user-facing paths; backoff + jitter; per-try timeouts; never exceed remaining deadline |
| Timeout Budgets | Deadlines/cancellation + DB statement timeouts | Any remote call or query | Budget per hop; fail fast; propagate deadlines; set DB query timeout and pool wait timeout |
| Bulkheads + Backpressure | Concurrency limiters, separate pools/queues, admission control | Overload/saturation risk | Separate pools per dependency; bound queues; reject early (429/503) over uncontrolled latency growth |
| Graceful Degradation | Feature flags, cached/stale fallback, partial responses | Non-critical features and partial outages | Define data freshness + UX; instrument fallback rate; avoid silent degradation |
| Health Checks | K8s liveness/readiness/startup probes | Orchestration and load balancing | Liveness shallow; readiness checks critical deps (bounded); startup for slow init; add graceful shutdown |
| Chaos / Fault Injection | Fault proxies, service-mesh faults, managed chaos tools | Validate behavior under real failure modes | Start in non-prod; control blast radius; timebox; predefine stop conditions; record experiment parameters |

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| External API calls | Circuit breaker + retry with exponential backoff |
| Database queries | Timeout + connection pooling + circuit breaker |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **No timeouts** - Infinite waits exhaust resources
- **Infinite retries** - Amplifies problems (thundering herd)
- **Retries without idempotency** - Duplicate side effects and data corruption
- **No circuit breakers** - Cascading failures
- **Tight coupling** - One failure breaks everything
- **Silent failures** - No observability into degraded state
- **No bulkheads** - Shared thread pools exhaust all resources
- **Failover never tested** - DR plan fails during a real incident
- **Testing only happy path** - Production reveals failures

## Optional: AI / Automation

Do:
- Use AI to propose failure-mode scenarios from an explicit risk register; keep only scenarios that map to known dependencies and business journeys.
- Use AI to summarize experiment results (metrics deltas, error clusters) and draft postmortem timelines; verify with telemetry.

Avoid:
- "Scenario generation" without a risk map (creates noise and wasted load).
- Letting AI relax timeouts/retries or remove guardrails.

## Usage Notes

**Pattern Selection:**

- Start with circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Add retries for transient failures (network, rate limits)
- Use bulkheads to prevent resource exhaustion
- Combine patterns for defense-in-depth

**Observability:**

- Track circuit breaker state changes
- Monitor retry attempts and success rates
- Alert on degraded mode duration
- Measure recovery time after failures

**Testing:**

- Start chaos experiments in non-production
- Define hypothesis before failure injection
- Set blast radius limits and auto-revert
- Document learnings and action items

Success criteria: systems gracefully handle failures, recover automatically, maintain partial functionality during outages, and fail fast to prevent cascading failures. Resilience is tested proactively through fault injection and game days (with guardrails).

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
