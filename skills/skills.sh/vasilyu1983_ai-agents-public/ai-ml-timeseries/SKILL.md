# Time Series Forecasting — Modern Patterns & Production Best Practices

**Modern Best Practices (January 2026)**:

- Treat **time** as a first-class axis: temporal splits, rolling backtests, and point-in-time correctness.
- Default to **strong baselines** (naive/seasonal naive) before complex models.
- Prevent leakage: feature windows and aggregations must use only information available at prediction time.
- Evaluate by **horizon** and **segment**; a single aggregate metric hides failures.
- Prefer **probabilistic** forecasts when decisions are risk-sensitive (quantiles/intervals); evaluate calibration (coverage) and use pinball/CRPS.
- For many related series, consider **global + hierarchical** approaches (shared models + reconciliation); validate across levels and key segments.
- Treat **time zones/DST** as first-class; validate timestamp alignment before feature generation.
- Define retraining cadence and degraded modes (fallback model, last-known-good forecast).

This skill provides **operational, copy-paste-ready workflows** for forecasting with recent advances: TS-specific EDA, temporal validation, lag/rolling features, model selection, multi-step forecasting, backtesting, generative AI (Chronos, TimesFM), and production deployment with drift monitoring.

It focuses on **hands-on forecasting execution**, not theory.

## Decision Tree: Choosing Time Series Approach

```text
User needs time series forecasting for: [Data Type]
    ├─ Strong Seasonality?
    │   ├─ Simple patterns? → LightGBM with seasonal features
    │   ├─ Complex patterns? → LightGBM + Prophet comparison
    │   └─ Multiple seasonalities? → Prophet or TBATS
    │
    ├─ Long-term Dependencies (>50 steps)?
    │   ├─ Transformers (TimesFM, Chronos) → Best for complex patterns
    │   └─ RNNs/LSTMs → Good for sequential dependencies
    │
    ├─ Event Forecasting (binary outcomes)?
    │   └─ Temporal classification / survival modelling → validate with time-based splits
    │
    ├─ Intermittent/Sparse Data (many zeros)?
    │   ├─ Croston/SBA → Classical intermittent methods
    │   └─ LightGBM with zero-inflation features → Modern approach
    │
    ├─ Multiple Covariates?
    │   ├─ LightGBM → Best with many features
    │   └─ TFT/DeepAR → If deep learning needed
    │
    └─ Explainability Required (healthcare, finance)?
        ├─ LightGBM → SHAP values, feature importance
        └─ Linear models → Most interpretable
```

## Core Concepts (Vendor-Agnostic)

- **Time axis**: splits, features, and labels must respect time ordering and availability.
- **Non-stationarity**: seasonality, trend, and regime shifts are normal; monitor and retrain intentionally.
- **Evaluation**: rolling/expanding backtests; report horizon-wise and segment-wise performance.
- **Operationalization**: define retraining cadence, fallback models, and data freshness contracts.
- **Data governance**: treat time series as potentially sensitive; enforce access control, retention, and PII scrubbing in logs.

## Implementation Practices (Tooling Examples)

- Build features with explicit time windows; store cutoff timestamps with each training run.
- Backtest with a standardized harness (rolling/expanding windows, horizon-wise metrics).
- Log production forecasts with metadata (model version, horizon, data cut) to enable debugging.
- Implement fallbacks (baseline model, last-known-good, “insufficient data” handling) for outages and anomalies.

## Do / Avoid

**Do**
- Do start with naive/seasonal naive baselines and compare against learned models (Forecasting: Principles and Practice: https://otexts.com/fpp3/).
- Do backtest with rolling windows and preserve point-in-time correctness.
- Do monitor for data pipeline changes (missing timestamps, level shifts, calendar changes).
- Do align metrics/loss to the decision: asymmetric costs, service levels, and probabilistic targets (quantiles/intervals) when needed.

**Avoid**
- Avoid random splits for forecasting problems.
- Avoid features that use future information (future aggregates, leakage via target encoding).
- Avoid optimizing only aggregate metrics; always inspect horizon-wise errors and worst segments.
- Avoid MAPE when the target can be 0 or near-0; prefer MASE/WAPE/sMAPE and horizon-wise reporting.

## Usage Notes

**For Claude:**

- Activate this skill for hands-on forecasting tasks, feature engineering, backtesting, or production setup
- Start with [Quick Reference](#quick-reference) and [Decision Tree](#decision-tree-choosing-time-series-approach) for fast guidance
- Drill into references/ for detailed implementation patterns
- Use assets/ for copy-paste ready code
- Always check for temporal leakage (future data in training)
- Start with strong baselines; choose model family based on horizon, covariates, and latency/cost constraints
- Emphasize explainability for healthcare/finance domains
- Monitor for data distribution shifts in production

**Key Principle:** Time series forecasting is about temporal structure, not IID assumptions. Use temporal validation, avoid future leakage, and choose models based on horizon length and data characteristics.

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
