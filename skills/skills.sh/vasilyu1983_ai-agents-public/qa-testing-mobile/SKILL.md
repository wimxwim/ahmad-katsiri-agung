# QA Mobile Testing

Design and execute reliable, cost-aware mobile testing across iOS and Android (native + cross-platform).

## Quick Start

- Fill `assets/mobile-test-plan.md` to define risk, layers, and gates.
- Fill `assets/device-matrix.md` from analytics to pick Tier 1/2/3 coverage.
- Use `references/framework-comparison.md` to choose automation frameworks.
- Use `references/flake-management.md` to set a flake budget, reruns, and quarantine rules.

## Scope

- Define mobile test strategy across iOS and Android.
- Plan device matrix, OS coverage, and risk tiers.
- Choose automation frameworks and CI + device lab setup.
- Address performance, network/offline, backgrounding, and permissions.
- Define pre-release gates, staged rollout, and store readiness checks.

## When NOT to Use

- Platform-specific iOS test command details -> [qa-testing-ios](../qa-testing-ios/SKILL.md)
- Platform-specific Android test command details -> [qa-testing-android](../qa-testing-android/SKILL.md)

## Inputs

- Platforms, supported OS versions, and device targets.
- App type (native, cross-platform, hybrid/webview).
- Critical user flows and risk areas.
- Distribution channels and release cadence.
- Existing test tooling, CI, and device lab access (Firebase Test Lab, BrowserStack, AWS Device Farm).
- Observability and rollout controls (Crashlytics/Sentry, performance/RUM, feature flags, staged rollout).
- Test data strategy (seed/reset, test accounts, environment parity).

## Workflow

1. Define quality risks and SLIs (crash-free, ANR, startup time, key flow success).
2. Build a device matrix from analytics; keep PR gates emulator/simulator-first.
3. Choose frameworks (default: XCUITest + Espresso/Compose; add cross-platform only when it reduces total cost).
4. Build test layers: unit, integration/contract, UI smoke, targeted E2E on real devices.
5. Add mobile-specific coverage: permissions, background/foreground, deep links, offline/poor network.
6. Add performance checks (startup, scrolling/jank, memory) and accessibility checks.
7. Set flake budget, rerun limits, quarantine policy, and failure triage (artifacts + reproducibility).
8. Define release gates + store readiness; ship via staged rollout with monitoring + rollback.

## Outputs

- Mobile test strategy and device matrix.
- Automation plan and framework selection.
- Test case inventory with priorities.
- Release readiness checklist.
- CI pipeline and reporting plan.

## Quality Checks

- Keep UI tests focused on critical flows; keep suites small and fast.
- Separate device specific bugs from logic regressions.
- Track flake rate per test/device; quarantine and fix top offenders.
- Verify permissions, notifications, and background behavior.
- Prefer stable selectors (accessibility IDs/test tags), not localized text.

## Templates

- `assets/device-matrix.md` for OS and device coverage.
- `assets/mobile-test-plan.md` for test scope and automation.
- `assets/release-readiness-checklist.md` for release gates.

## Resources

- `references/framework-comparison.md` for choosing between XCUITest, Espresso/Compose, Appium, Detox, Maestro, and Flutter testing.
- `references/flake-management.md` for flake control guidance.
- `references/device-farm-strategies.md` for cloud device farm selection and cost optimization.
- `references/mobile-performance-testing.md` for startup, jank, memory, and battery testing.
- `references/cross-platform-test-patterns.md` for React Native, Flutter, and KMP testing patterns.
- `data/sources.json` for curated documentation and device lab links.

## Related Skills

- Use [qa-testing-ios](../qa-testing-ios/SKILL.md) for iOS specific depth (XCTest, Swift Testing, simctl).
- Use [qa-testing-android](../qa-testing-android/SKILL.md) for Android specific depth (Espresso, Compose Testing, UIAutomator).
- Use [qa-testing-playwright](../qa-testing-playwright/SKILL.md) for web and webview testing.
- Use [software-mobile](../software-mobile/SKILL.md) for mobile architecture guidance.

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
