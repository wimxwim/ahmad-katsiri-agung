# LLM Development & Engineering — Complete Reference

Build, evaluate, and deploy LLM systems with **modern production standards**.

This skill covers the full LLM lifecycle:

- **Development**: Strategy selection, dataset design, instruction tuning, PEFT/LoRA fine-tuning
- **Evaluation**: Automated testing, LLM-as-judge, metrics, rollout gates
- **Deployment**: Serving handoff, latency/cost budgeting, reliability patterns (see `ai-llm-inference`)
- **Operations**: Quality monitoring, change management, incident response (see `ai-mlops`)
- **Safety**: Threat modeling, data governance, layered mitigations (NIST AI RMF: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf)

**Modern Best Practices (2026)**:

- Treat the model as a **component** with contracts, budgets, and rollback plans (not "magic").
- Separate **core concepts** (tokenization, context, training vs adaptation) from **implementation choices** (providers, SDKs).
- Gate upgrades with repeatable evals and staged rollout; avoid blind model swaps.
- **Cost-aware engineering**: Measure cost per successful outcome, not just cost per token; design tiering/caching early.
- **Security-by-design**: Threat model prompt injection, data leakage, and tool abuse; treat guardrails as production code.

**For detailed patterns:** See [Resources](#resources-best-practices--operational-patterns) and [Templates](#templates-copy-paste-ready) sections below.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Tool/Framework | Command/Pattern | When to Use |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Choose architecture | Prompt vs RAG vs fine-tune | Start simple; add retrieval/adaptation only if needed | New products and migrations |
| Model selection | Scoring matrix | Quality/latency/cost/privacy/license weighting | Provider changes and procurement |
| **Cost optimization** | Tiered models + caching | Cascade routing, prompt caching, budget guardrails | Cost-sensitive production |
| **Fine-tuning ROI** | ROI calculator | Break-even analysis, TCO comparison | Investment decisions |
| Prompt contracts | Structured output + constraints | JSON schema, max tokens, refusal rules | Reliability and integration |
| RAG integration | Hybrid retrieval + grounding | Retrieve → rerank → pack → cite → verify | Fresh/large corpora, traceability |
| Fine-tuning | PEFT/LoRA (when justified) | Small targeted datasets + regression suite | Stable domains, repeated tasks |
| Evaluation | Offline + online | Golden sets + A/B + canary + monitoring | Prevent regressions and drift |

## Decision Tree: LLM System Architecture

```text
Building LLM application: [Architecture Selection]
    ├─ Need current knowledge?
    │   ├─ Simple Q&A? → Basic RAG (page-level chunking + hybrid retrieval)
    │   └─ Complex retrieval? → Advanced RAG (reranking + contextual retrieval)
    │
    ├─ Need tool use / actions?
    │   ├─ Single task? → Simple agent (ReAct pattern)
    │   └─ Multi-step workflow? → Multi-agent (LangGraph, CrewAI)
    │
    ├─ Static behavior sufficient?
    │   ├─ Quick MVP? → Prompt engineering (CI/CD integrated)
    │   └─ Production quality? → Fine-tuning (PEFT/LoRA)
    │
    └─ Best results?
        └─ Hybrid (RAG + Fine-tuning + Agents) → Comprehensive solution
```

**See [Decision Matrices](references/decision-matrices.md) for detailed selection criteria.**

## Cost-Quality Decision Framework

LLM spend is driven by usage-based inference (tokens/requests) plus supporting infra and engineering. Model selection is a **cost-quality-latency-risk tradeoff**.

### Model Tier Strategy

| Tier | Typical profile | Use For |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| **Value** | Small/fast models | High-volume, simple tasks |
| **Balanced** | General-purpose models | Most production workloads |
| **Premium** | Frontier/large models | Hardest tasks, low volume |

### Cost Optimization Levers

1. **Model tiering**: Route simple requests to cheaper models (often large savings at scale)
2. **Prompt caching**: Reuse stable prefixes/context (provider-specific discounts and constraints)
3. **Prompt optimization**: Compress examples and instructions (typically meaningful token reduction)
4. **Output limits**: Set appropriate max_tokens (prevents runaway costs)

### When to Fine-Tune (ROI-Based)

Fine-tuning pays off when:
- **Volume justifies it**: >10k requests/month provides meaningful cost savings
- **Domain is stable**: Requirements unchanged for >6 months
- **Data exists**: >1,000 quality training examples available
- **Break-even achievable**: <12 months to recover investment

**See [Cost Economics](references/cost-economics.md) for TCO modeling and [Fine-Tuning ROI Calculator](assets/selection/fine-tuning-roi-calculator.md) for investment analysis.**

## Core Concepts (Vendor-Agnostic)

- **Model classes**: encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder, multimodal; choose based on task and latency.
- **Tokenization & limits**: context window, max output, and prompt/template overhead drive both cost and tail latency.
- **Adaptation options**: prompting → retrieval → adapters (LoRA) → full fine-tune; choose by stability and ROI (LoRA: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685).
- **Evaluation**: metrics must map to user value; report uncertainty and slice performance, not only global averages.
- **Governance**: data retention, residency, licensing, and auditability are product requirements (EU AI Act: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj; NIST GenAI Profile: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.600-1.pdf).

## Implementation Practices (Tooling Examples)

- Use a **provider abstraction** (gateway/router) to enable fallbacks and staged upgrades.
- Instrument requests with tokens, latency, and error classes (OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/).
- Maintain **prompt/model registries** with versioning, changelogs, and rollback criteria.

## Do / Avoid

**Do**
- Do pin model + prompt versions in production, and re-run evals before any change.
- Do enforce budgets at the boundary: max tokens, max tools, max retries, max cost.
- Do plan for degraded modes (smaller model, cached answers, “unable to answer”).

**Avoid**
- Avoid model sprawl (unowned variants with no eval coverage).
- Avoid blind upgrades based on anecdotal quality; require measured impact.
- Avoid training on production logs without consent, governance, and leakage controls.

## Trend Awareness Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: For “best/latest” recommendations, verify recency using current sources (official docs/release notes/benchmarks). If you can’t browse, state assumptions and ask for timeframe + constraints.

### Trigger Conditions

- "What's the best LLM model for [use case]?"
- "What should I use for [RAG/fine-tuning/agents]?"
- "What's the latest in LLM development?"
- "Current best practices for [prompting/evaluation/deployment]?"
- "Is [model/framework] still relevant in 2026?"
- "[Model A] vs [Model B]?" or "[Framework A] vs [Framework B]?"
- "Best vector database for [use case]?"
- "What agent framework should I use?"

### Minimal Verification Checklist

1. Confirm user constraints: latency, cost, privacy/compliance, deployment target, and toolchain.
2. Check at least 2 authoritative sources from `data/sources.json` (provider docs, release notes, pricing/quotas, deprecations).
3. Prefer stable guidance (tradeoffs + decision criteria) over “one best model/framework”.

### What to Report

After searching, provide:

- **Current landscape**: What models/frameworks are popular NOW (not 6 months ago)
- **Emerging trends**: New models, frameworks, or techniques gaining traction
- **Deprecated/declining**: Models/frameworks losing relevance or support
- **Recommendation**: Based on fresh data, not just static knowledge

### Example Topics (verify with fresh sources)

- Latest frontier models (GPT-4.5, Claude 4, Gemini 2.x, Llama 4)
- Agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel)
- Vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, pgvector)
- RAG techniques (contextual retrieval, agentic RAG, graph RAG)
- Inference engines (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang)
- Evaluation frameworks (RAGAS, DeepEval, Braintrust)
