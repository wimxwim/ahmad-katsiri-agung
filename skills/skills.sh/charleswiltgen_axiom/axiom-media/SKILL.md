## Cross-Domain Routing

**Camera + permissions** (camera access denied, Info.plist missing):
- Camera code → **stay here** (camera-capture)
- Privacy manifest / Info.plist → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)
- Build/entitlement errors → **invoke axiom-build**

**ShazamKit + microphone permissions**:
- Microphone NSMicrophoneUsageDescription → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)
- ShazamKit API and matching → **stay here** (shazamkit)

**Now Playing + background audio**:
- Now Playing metadata/controls → **stay here** (now-playing)
- Background audio mode / BGTaskScheduler → **invoke axiom-integration** (background-processing reference)

**Photo library + privacy**:
- Photo picker (PHPicker, PhotosPicker) → **stay here** (photo-library) — no permissions needed
- Full PHPhotoLibrary access → **stay here** (photo-library-ref) — limited access model
- Privacy manifest for photo usage → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)

**DockKit + camera / custom inference**:
- DockKit stand control, framing, motor, tracking states → **stay here** (dockkit)
- Underlying AVCaptureSession setup → **stay here** (camera-capture)
- Custom Vision / Core ML inference feeding observations → **invoke axiom-vision**
- Camera permission (NSCameraUsageDescription) → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)

**MediaIntelligence + Vision** (faces, image analysis):
- Group faces into people across a library, video highlights / key frames → **stay here** (media-intelligence) — clustering identities + on-device video moment detection
- Detect *where* a face is in one image (bounding box, landmarks), OCR, segmentation → **invoke axiom-vision** — per-image detection, a different problem
- System Photos "People" album → that album is system-owned (PhotoKit); MediaIntelligence builds *your own* index over assets you manage → **stay here** (photo-library for the asset access)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Camera capture is just AVCaptureSession setup" | Camera has interruption handlers, rotation, and threading requirements. |
| "Camera launch is fast enough if I startRunning() early" | Output initialization dominates launch; iOS 26 deferred start halves time-to-preview. |
| "I'll add haptics with a simple API call" | Haptic design has patterns for each interaction type matching HIG. |
| "ShazamKit is just SHSession + a delegate" | iOS 17+ has SHManagedSession which eliminates all AVAudioEngine boilerplate. |
| "Now Playing info is just setting metadata" | Remote commands, artwork handling, and state sync have 15+ gotchas. |
| "I'll use UIImagePickerController for photos" | PHPicker/PhotosPicker are the modern API — no permissions required. |
| "DockKit is just pairing a stand" | Custom control needs system tracking disabled, handles inverted dock states, and two different coordinate origins. |
| "Grouping faces is just Vision face detection" | Vision detects faces in one image; MediaIntelligence clusters them into persistent people (entities) across a whole library, with its own working directory and state. |
| "Casting to Chromecast means bundling the Google Cast SDK" | On iOS 27, AVSystemRouting exposes non-AirPlay routes as system routes — you adopt one Apple API (observe events, start a session, drive playbackControl) instead of a per-vendor SDK. Likely EU-gated/beta — gate and keep a fallback. |
| "ScreenCaptureKit on iPad works like the Mac (enumerate displays/windows)" | On iOS/iPadOS `SCShareableContent` and all `SCContentFilter` initializers are macOS-only — you get a filter ONLY from the system `SCContentSharingPicker`. New on iOS/iPadOS/tvOS/visionOS 27. Also not `ImageRenderer` (that snapshots your own SwiftUI view). |
