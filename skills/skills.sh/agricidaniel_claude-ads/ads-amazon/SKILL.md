# Amazon Ads Deep Analysis

Amazon owns ~80% of US retail media (~$56B in 2025). This sub-skill audits
the three Sponsored ad types plus basic DSP visibility for sellers and
vendors. Detailed Amazon DSP audit (programmatic / Twitch / Fire TV / Freevee
/ Prime Video) is queued for Wave 3 in `ads-retail-media`.

> **Note:** This is a leaf sub-skill. The thresholds and rules below live
> inline. In Wave 3, once `ads-walmart` ships and the `ads-retail-media`
> orchestrator extracts the shared retail-media logic, a dedicated
> `retail-media-specs.md` reference file will replace these inline rules
> (planned, not yet created — do not link to it from other files).

## Process

1. Collect Amazon Advertising export: Search Term Report (last 60 days),
   Campaign Performance Report, Targeting Report, Placement Report, Bulk
   Operations file
2. Collect Brand Analytics if available (Brand-Registered sellers / vendors):
   Search Terms, Repeat Purchase Behavior, Item Comparison
3. Verify Seller / Vendor Central context (vendor strategy differs from
   seller strategy on portfolio, coupons, and Sponsored Brands video)
4. Read `ads/references/benchmarks.md` for Amazon-specific benchmarks
5. Read `ads/references/scoring-system.md` for weighted scoring
6. Evaluate checks per category
7. Calculate Amazon Ads Health Score (0-100)
8. Generate findings report with action plan

## What to Analyze

### Campaign Structure & Portfolios (15% weight)

- **Portfolio organization** — campaigns grouped by funnel stage (Awareness /
  Consideration / Conversion) or by product line, not ad-hoc
- **Campaign naming convention** consistent (e.g.,
  `SP_Brand_Exact_USD_Conv` / `SB_NonBrand_HSA_Video_USD_Cons`)
- **Auto vs Manual mix**: Sponsored Products has ≥1 Auto campaign per ASIN
  cluster for search-term harvesting (auto-mining workflow)
- **ASIN-level coverage**: every priority ASIN appears in ≥1 SP campaign
  (Exact, Phrase, or Broad) AND ≥1 Auto campaign
- **Targeting type mix in SP**: Manual Keyword + Manual Product (ASIN
  targeting) + Auto (for harvesting). Pure Auto is a learning-only state
- **Sponsored Brands**: at least one HSA (Headline Search Ad) campaign per
  brand storefront; SB Video tested for high-AOV products
- **Sponsored Display**: separate Audience (retargeting + lookalike) and
  Contextual (product / category targeting) campaigns — don't mix in one

### Search-Term Harvesting & Negatives (25% weight)

- **Auto → Manual harvest cadence** weekly or bi-weekly: pull converting
  search terms from Auto, promote winners to Manual Exact in their target
  campaign, add as negatives to the Auto so spend redirects
- **Negative keyword coverage**: every Auto campaign has Manual campaign
  ASINs as negatives (prevents Auto cannibalizing Manual placements)
- **Negative product targeting**: irrelevant ASINs added at campaign level
  (prevents Sponsored Display contextual targeting from showing your ad
  next to incompatible products)
- **Search Term Report harvested last 7 days** — any high-spend, zero-
  conversion terms above $10 / 30 days should be negatives
- **Brand defense**: branded search terms are isolated in a separate
  campaign with exact-match brand keywords and competitor-name negatives
- **Top-of-search visibility** — branded search auction CPC vs default; flag
  if competitor bid is above your brand-defense bid

### ACOS / TACOS Discipline (20% weight)

- **ACOS targets set per portfolio** based on contribution margin (target
  ACOS = (1 - contribution_margin) × buffer). Sloppy "30% across the board"
  ACOS targets cap performance
- **TACOS (Total ACOS) trending down** quarter-over-quarter — TACOS measures
  total ad spend / total revenue including organic; downward trend means
  paid is lifting organic, not replacing it
- **ROAS reported alongside ACOS** for the team that thinks in ROAS
- **Coupon + Lightning Deal stacking** — when on, ACOS targets relaxed to
  capture lift; auto-flag campaigns that need temporary ACOS uplift
- **Day-parting**: bid adjustments by hour for ASINs where add-to-cart
  hours differ from purchase hours (frequent for high-AOV electronics)

### Bid & Budget Management (15% weight)

- **Dynamic bidding strategy**: `Up and Down` for Manual Exact converting
  campaigns; `Down Only` for Auto campaigns or Sponsored Display contextual
  (avoid bid escalation in learning campaigns)
- **Placement bid multipliers**: Top-of-search placement adjusted based on
  ROAS by placement (Placement Report); often +50-100% for top-of-search,
  -30% for product page placements
- **Budget caps appropriate** — no campaigns capped at <2x current daily
  spend (caps strangle algorithm learning)
- **Bulk bid adjustments** — bid optimization runs weekly via Bulk
  Operations not ad-hoc in the UI

### Sponsored Brands (10% weight)

- **HSA (Headline Search Ad)**: brand logo + 3-product showcase + landing
  page (Store, custom URL, or product list)
- **SB Video**: 6-45s; 15-30s sweet spot. Hook within 2s. Captions on.
  Required for high-AOV products
- **Brand Store linked** as landing destination where available (higher
  CVR than product detail page)
- **Negative keywords on SB** include competitor brand names if you don't
  want top-of-funnel competitor traffic; remove if you do

### Sponsored Display (10% weight)

- **Audience targeting**: Views Remarketing, Purchase Remarketing, Cross-
  Sell, and Lookalike audiences each scaled with appropriate bids
- **Contextual targeting**: relevant categories AND specific ASIN targeting
  (your own complementary products + competitor ASINs you can win)
- **Display creative quality**: at minimum, the default product creative;
  custom creative tested for top SKUs
- **Off-Amazon Sponsored Display** (Twitch, IMDb, third-party sites) audited
  separately — different CPC dynamics, different attribution windows

### Brand Analytics & Reporting (5% weight)

- **Brand Analytics** accessed (Brand-Registered only): Top Search Terms,
  Item Comparison, Repeat Purchase Behavior
- **Top Search Terms report** used to identify share-of-voice gaps vs
  competitors on category keywords
- **Repeat Purchase Behavior** informs subscription / replenishment ad
  strategy
- **Amazon Attribution** (off-Amazon traffic) tracked if running external
  ads driving to Amazon listings

## Key Thresholds

| Metric | Pass | Warning | Fail |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| ACOS (vs target) | Within ±10% of target | 10-25% over | >25% over |
| TACOS trend (90d) | Decreasing | Flat | Increasing |
| Auto / Manual mix | Both active per ASIN | Only Manual or only Auto | Single campaign / ASIN |
| Negative keywords on Auto | Manual ASIN keywords added | Some missing | None |
| Search term harvest cadence | Weekly | Monthly | Ad-hoc |
| Branded campaign ACOS | <5% | 5-15% | >15% |
| Dynamic bidding strategy | Up-and-Down on converters, Down-Only on learners | Mixed inconsistently | All campaigns same strategy |
| Sponsored Brands video tested | Active on top 10 ASINs | Active on 1-3 ASINs | Not tested |
| Brand Analytics accessed | Weekly | Monthly | Never |
