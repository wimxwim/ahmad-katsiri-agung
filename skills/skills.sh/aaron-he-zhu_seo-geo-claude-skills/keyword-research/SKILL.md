# Keyword Research

Discovers, scores, and clusters keywords for SEO and GEO planning.

## Quick Start

```
Research keywords for [topic/product/service]
```

```
What keywords is [competitor URL] ranking for that I should target?
```

## Skill Contract

**Expected output**: a prioritized keyword brief plus the standard handoff summary for `memory/research/`.

- **Reads**: topic or seed keyword, target market/language, business goal, site DR, and any user-provided or tool metrics.
- **Writes**: a user-facing research deliverable and reusable summary.
- **Promotes**: durable keyword priorities, competitor facts, and pending strategy decisions to `memory/hot-cache.md`, `memory/open-loops.md`, and `memory/research/`.
- **Done when**: every shortlisted keyword carries volume + difficulty + intent (or a labeled N/A); keywords are grouped into pillar + cluster hubs; and the deliverable names at least 3 prioritized Quick Win / Growth / GEO opportunities.
- **Primary next skill**: [competitor-analysis](../competitor-analysis/SKILL.md) when the keyword set is ready for market comparison.

### Handoff Summary

> Emit the standard shape from [skill-contract.md §Handoff Summary Format](../../references/skill-contract.md).

## Data Sources

Optional integrations: ~~SEO tool, ~~search console. Without tools, ask for seed keywords, audience, goals, and any known metrics. See [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md).

**Zero-dependency local helper** (no tool needed): `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/connectors/suggest.py" "<seed>" --expand` harvests free keyword ideas from Google Autocomplete (⚠️ unofficial endpoint). Search *volume / difficulty* still needs `~~SEO tool` or own Search Console data. See [scripts/connectors/README.md](../../scripts/connectors/README.md).

**Striking-distance shortcut** (when `~~search console` is connected): before broad discovery, mine your own GSC query data for terms already ranking in positions ~5–20 — page-one tail and page two. These are proven demand a small push can convert, so they are the fastest opportunity set. The Search Analytics API sorts by clicks and has **no position filter**, so request a high `rowLimit` and filter the 5–20 window client-side, then attach volume / difficulty / intent to that shortlist. Work this set first; treat its metrics as **Measured**.

## Instructions

When a user requests keyword research, run eight phases and announce each as `[Phase X/8: Name]`:

1. **Scope** — clarify product, audience, business goal, DR, geography, and language.
2. **Discover** — seed from core, problem, solution, audience, and industry terms.
3. **Variations** — expand with modifiers and long-tail patterns.
4. **Classify** — tag by intent (informational, navigational, commercial, transactional).
5. **Score** — assign difficulty (1-100) and compute `Opportunity = (Volume × Intent Value) / Difficulty`, with Intent Value `1 / 1 / 2 / 3`.
6. **GEO-Check** — flag AI-answer-friendly queries such as questions, definitions, comparisons, lists, and how-tos.
7. **Cluster** — group keywords into pillar + cluster topic hubs.
8. **Deliver** — output an Executive Summary, Quick Wins / Growth / GEO opportunities, Topic Clusters, Content Calendar, and Next Steps.

Label every metric **Measured** (tool/export), **User-provided**, or **Estimated** (model inference); never present an estimate as measured; if a required metric is unavailable, mark it N/A — do not invent it.

**Quality bar**: every recommendation includes at least one specific number. Rewrite generic advice into a concrete keyword + volume + difficulty + reason.
