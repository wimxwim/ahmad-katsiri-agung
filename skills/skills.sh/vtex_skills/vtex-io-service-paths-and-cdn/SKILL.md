# VTEX IO service paths and CDN behavior

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when you define or change **`service.json` routes** for a VTEX IO backend and need the edge (CDN) to pass the **right cookies** and apply the **right caching** for that endpoint’s data.

- Choosing between **public**, **segment** (`/_v/segment/...`), and **private** (`/_v/private/...`) path prefixes for a route
- Setting **`Cache-Control`** (and related headers) on HTTP responses so **public** cache behavior matches **data scope** (anonymous vs segment vs authenticated shopper)
- Explaining why a route **does not** receive `vtex_session` or `vtex_segment` cookies
- Troubleshooting **CloudFront** or edge behavior when cookies are missing (see official troubleshooting)

Do not use this skill for:

- Application-level LRU caches, VBase, or stale-while-revalidate orchestration → use **vtex-io-application-performance**
- GraphQL field-level `@cacheControl` only → use **vtex-io-graphql-api** alongside this skill

## Decision rules

- Paths are declared in **`service.json`** under `routes`. The **prefix** you choose (`/yourPath`, `/_v/segment/yourPath`, `/_v/private/yourPath`) controls **cookie forwarding** and **whether VTEX may cache the service response at the edge**—see the [Service path patterns](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/service-path-patterns) table.
- **Public** (`{yourPath}`): **No guarantee** the app receives request cookies. The edge **may cache** responses when possible. Use for **non-user-specific** data (e.g. static reference data that is safe to share across shoppers).
- **Segment** (`/_v/segment/{yourPath}`): The app receives **`vtex_segment`**. The edge caches **per segment**. Use when the response depends on **segment** (currency, region, sales channel, etc.) but **not** on authenticated identity.
- **Private** (`/_v/private/{yourPath}`): The app receives **`vtex_segment`** and **`vtex_session`**. The edge **does not cache** the service response. Use for **identity- or session-scoped** data (orders, addresses, profile).
- **`Cache-Control` on responses** must align with **classification**: never signal **CDN/shared cache** for payloads that embed **secrets**, **per-user** data, or **authorization** decisions unless the contract is explicitly designed for that (e.g. immutable public assets). When in doubt, prefer **private paths** and **no-store / private** cache directives for shopper-specific JSON.
- Read [Sessions System overview](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/sessions-system-overview) for how cookies relate to paths and sessions.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Do not use a public or segment-cached path for private or auth-scoped payloads

Routes that return **authenticated shopper data**, **PII**, or **authorization-sensitive** JSON **must not** rely on **public** paths or **edge-cached** responses that could serve one user’s data to another.

**Why this matters** — The edge may cache or route without the session context you expect; misclassified data can leak across users or segments.

**Detection** — A route under a **public** path returns **order history**, **addresses**, **tokens**, or **account-specific** fields; or **`Cache-Control`** suggests long-lived public caching for such payloads.

**Correct** — Use `/_v/private/...` for the route (or a pattern that receives `vtex_session`), and set **appropriate** `Cache-Control` (e.g. `private, no-store` for JSON APIs that are not cacheable). Note: the **path prefix** (`/_v/private/`) controls **CDN and cookie** behavior; the `"public": true` field controls **whether VTEX auth tokens are required** to call the route—these are **orthogonal**.

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "myOrders": {
      "path": "/_v/private/my-app/orders",
      "public": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong** — Exposing `GET /my-app/orders` as a **public** path (no `/_v/private/` or `/_v/segment/` prefix) and returning **per-user** JSON while **assuming** the browser session is always visible to the service.

## Preferred pattern

1. **Classify the response** (anonymous, segment, authenticated) **before** picking the path prefix.
2. **Map** to **public** / **segment** / **private** per [Service path patterns](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/service-path-patterns).
3. **Set** response headers **explicitly** where the platform allows: align **`Cache-Control`** with the same classification (public immutable vs private vs no-store).
4. **Document** any path that must stay **private** for security or compliance so storefronts and BFFs do not link-cache it incorrectly.

## Common failure modes

- **Assuming cookies on public routes** — Services do not reliably receive `vtex_session` on public paths; identity logic fails intermittently.
- **Caching personalized JSON at the edge** — Long `max-age` on user-specific responses without `private` path + correct cache policy.
- **Mixing concerns** — One route returns both **public catalog** and **private account** data; split endpoints or use **private** + server-side auth checks.
- **Ignoring segment** — Price or promo that varies by **currency** or **segment** is served on a **public** path and **cached** for the wrong segment.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is each route’s **path prefix** (`public` / `/_v/segment` / `/_v/private`) justified by **cookie** and **Caching behavior** in the official table?
- [ ] For **shopper-specific** or **auth** responses, is the route **private** (or otherwise protected) and **not** edge-cacheable inappropriately?
- [ ] Do **`Cache-Control`** (and related) headers **match** data sensitivity?
- [ ] Are **parallel** calls from the client using the **correct** path for each payload type?
