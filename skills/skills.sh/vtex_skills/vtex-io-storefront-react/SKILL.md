# Storefront React Components

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when building shopper-facing React components under the `react` builder for storefront experiences.

- Creating product or category UI widgets
- Building custom banners, forms, and shopper-facing layout pieces
- Using storefront hooks or context providers
- Styling components with css-handles

Do not use this skill for:
- admin pages
- block registration and render-runtime contracts
- service runtime or backend route design
- GraphQL schema design

## Decision rules

- Treat storefront components as browser-facing UI and keep them safe for shopper contexts.
- Prefer keeping storefront components presentational and props-driven, and move complex data fetching or business logic to hooks or container components.
- Use `vtex.css-handles` instead of hardcoded global class names.
- Prefer receiving data through props or documented storefront hooks and contexts such as `useProduct`, `useRuntime`, or `useOrderForm` instead of calling VTEX APIs directly from the browser or using app keys in storefront code.
- Keep components resilient to loading, empty, and unavailable product or search context.
- For shopper-facing copy, use message IDs and helpers from the messages infrastructure, as described in `vtex-io-messages-and-i18n`, instead of string literals.
- Treat storefront components as part of the storefront accessibility surface: use semantic HTML elements such as `button` or `a` instead of clickable `div`s, and ensure important content has appropriate labels or alternative text.
- When accessing browser globals such as `window` or `document`, guard against server-side execution, for example by using `useEffect` or checking `typeof window !== 'undefined'`.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Storefront styling must use css-handles

Storefront components MUST expose styling through `css-handles`, not arbitrary hardcoded class names.

**Why this matters**

css-handles are the customization contract for storefront components. Hardcoded or hidden class names make themes harder to extend safely.

**Detection**

If a storefront component uses arbitrary global class names without css-handles, STOP and expose styling through handles first.

**Correct**

```tsx
const CSS_HANDLES = ['container', 'title'] as const
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
return <div className="my-random-block-root">...</div>
```

### Constraint: Storefront components must remain browser-safe

Storefront React code MUST not depend on Node-only APIs or server-only assumptions.

**Why this matters**

These components run in the shopper-facing frontend. Server-only dependencies break rendering and create runtime failures in the browser.

**Detection**

If a component uses Node-only modules, filesystem access, or server runtime assumptions, STOP and redesign it for the browser.

**Correct**

```tsx
return <span>{label}</span>
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
import fs from 'fs'
```

### Constraint: Shopper-facing strings must be localizable

Visible storefront strings MUST use the app i18n pattern instead of hardcoded text.

**Why this matters**

Storefront UIs run across locales and stores. Hardcoded strings make the component less reusable and less consistent with VTEX IO localization.

**Detection**

If shopper-visible copy is hardcoded in JSX, STOP and move it to the i18n mechanism.

**Correct**

```tsx
<FormattedMessage id="storefront.cta" />
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
<span>Buy now</span>
```

## Preferred pattern

Keep storefront components small, props-driven, css-handle-based, and safe for shopper contexts.

Minimal css-handles pattern:

```tsx
import { useCssHandles } from 'vtex.css-handles'

const CSS_HANDLES = ['container', 'title'] as const

export function MyComponent() {
  const { handles } = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)

  return (
    <div className={handles.container}>
      <h2 className={handles.title}>...</h2>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Common failure modes

- Hardcoding class names instead of using css-handles.
- Using browser-unsafe dependencies.
- Hardcoding shopper-visible strings.
- Fetching data in ad hoc ways instead of using VTEX storefront patterns.
- Putting complex business logic or heavy data fetching directly inside presentational components instead of using hooks or containers.
- Using non-semantic clickable elements such as `div` or `span` with `onClick` where a `button` or `a` element should be used.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is this component truly shopper-facing?
- [ ] Are styles exposed through css-handles?
- [ ] Is the component safe for browser execution?
- [ ] Are visible strings localized?
- [ ] Is the data flow appropriate for a storefront component?
