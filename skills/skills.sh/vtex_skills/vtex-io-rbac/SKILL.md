# VTEX IO access control (RBAC)

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when you need to **control who can access** your VTEX IO app's routes and resources:

- Deciding between **role-based** (`policies.json`) and **resource-based** (`service.json` policies) access control
- Securing **REST endpoints** so only specific apps, users, or API keys can call them
- Setting up **GraphQL authorization** with the `@auth` directive
- Understanding **VRN** (VTEX Resource Name) syntax for declaring principals
- Debugging **403 Forbidden** errors caused by missing or misconfigured policies

Do not use this skill for:

- General service architecture (use `vtex-io-service-apps`)
- PCI compliance and payment security (use `payment-pci-security`)
- Route prefix and CDN behavior (use `vtex-io-service-paths-and-cdn`)

## Decision rules

### Role-based vs resource-based policies

|                            | Role-based (`policies.json`)                                            | Resource-based (`service.json` policies)                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who can call?**          | Only other IO apps (by themselves or on behalf of other apps)           | Apps, users, and integrations (API keys)                                   |
| **API types**              | GraphQL and REST                                                        | REST only                                                                  |
| **How callers get access** | Must declare required policies in their `manifest.json`                 | No policy declaration needed; just call with auth token                    |
| **Where configured**       | `policies.json` in app root                                             | `policies` array inside route definition in `service.json`                 |
| **Use when**               | Exposing GraphQL endpoints; exposing REST endpoints for app-to-app only | Controlling access for users, API keys, or specific apps to REST endpoints |

### Choosing the right approach

- **GraphQL endpoints** → Use **role-based** policies (`policies.json`) **and/or** the **`@auth` directive** in the schema for user-level authorization.
- **REST endpoint called only by other IO apps** → Use **role-based** policies (`policies.json`). Consuming apps must declare the policy in their `manifest.json`.
- **REST endpoint called by users or API keys** → Use **resource-based** policies in `service.json`. Set the route as `"public": false` and define principals.
- **Public REST endpoint (no auth)** → Set `"public": true` in `service.json`. No policies needed, but be aware this means **anyone** can call it.

### VRN syntax

VRNs (VTEX Resource Names) identify resources and principals:

```text
vrn:{service}:{region}:{account}:{workspace}:{path}
```

- **Apps**: `vrn:apps:*:*:*:app/{vendor}.{app-name}@{version}`
- **Users**: `vrn:vtex.vtex-id:*:*:*:user/{email}`
- **API keys**: `vrn:vtex.vtex-id:*:*:*:user/vtexappkey-{account}-{hash}`
- **Wildcards**: `*` matches any value in a segment. `app/*` matches all apps. `user/*@gmail.com` matches all Gmail users.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Use resource-based policies when users or API keys need access

Role-based policies only work for **app-to-app** communication. If users (admin or storefront) or integrations (API keys) need to call your endpoint, you **must** use resource-based policies in `service.json` with the route set to `"public": false`.

**Why this matters** — Setting up a role-based policy for a route that users or API keys call results in 403 Forbidden for those callers, because role-based policies don't evaluate user/integration tokens.

**Detection** — A private route that should be callable by admin users or external integrations, but only has `policies.json` configuration and no `policies` array in `service.json`.

**Correct** — Resource-based policy in `service.json` for user/integration access.

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "orders": {
      "path": "/_v/private/my-app/orders",
      "public": false,
      "policies": [
        {
          "effect": "allow",
          "actions": ["GET", "POST"],
          "principals": [
            "vrn:vtex.vtex-id:*:*:*:user/*@mycompany.com",
            "vrn:apps:*:*:*:app/partner.integration-app@*"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong** — Only `policies.json` for a route that users need.

```json
// policies.json — this only covers app-to-app, not users
[
  {
    "name": "access-orders",
    "statements": [
      {
        "effect": "allow",
        "actions": ["GET"],
        "resources": ["vrn:my-app:*:*:*:/_v/private/my-app/orders"]
      }
    ]
  }
]
// Users calling this route still get 403
```

### Constraint: Deny policies take precedence over allow policies

When resource-based policies have overlapping principals between an `allow` and a `deny` rule, the **deny** always wins. Be careful with wildcards in allow rules that intersect with specific deny rules.

**Why this matters** — A broad `allow` for `app/*` combined with a specific `deny` for `app/vendor.bad-app@*` correctly blocks `bad-app`. But the reverse—a broad `deny` with a specific `allow`—blocks everything including what you wanted to allow.

**Detection** — Multiple policy entries for the same route with conflicting effects and overlapping principals.

**Correct** — Allow broadly, deny specifically.

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "effect": "allow",
      "actions": ["POST"],
      "principals": ["vrn:apps:*:*:*:app/*"]
    },
    {
      "effect": "deny",
      "actions": ["POST"],
      "principals": ["vrn:apps:*:*:*:app/untrusted.app@*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Wrong** — Deny broadly, try to allow specifically (the allow is overridden).

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "effect": "deny",
      "actions": ["POST"],
      "principals": ["vrn:apps:*:*:*:app/*"]
    },
    {
      "effect": "allow",
      "actions": ["POST"],
      "principals": ["vrn:apps:*:*:*:app/trusted.app@*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Preferred pattern

### Role-based policy (`policies.json`)

```json
[
  {
    "name": "resolve-graphql",
    "description": "Allows apps to resolve GraphQL requests",
    "statements": [
      {
        "effect": "allow",
        "actions": ["POST"],
        "resources": [
          "vrn:vtex.store-graphql:{{region}}:{{account}}:{{workspace}}:/_v/graphql"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The consuming app declares the policy in its `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "resolve-graphql"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Resource-based policy for mixed access

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "webhook": {
      "path": "/_v/private/my-app/webhook",
      "public": false,
      "policies": [
        {
          "effect": "allow",
          "actions": ["POST"],
          "principals": [
            "vrn:apps:*:*:*:app/vtex.orders-broadcast@*",
            "vrn:vtex.vtex-id:*:*:*:user/vtexappkey-myaccount-*"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### GraphQL `@auth` directive

For GraphQL endpoints, use the `@auth` directive for user-level authorization:

```graphql
type Query {
  orders: [Order] @auth(productCode: "10", resourceCode: "list-orders")
  adminSettings: Settings
    @auth(productCode: "10", resourceCode: "admin-settings")
}

type Mutation {
  updateSettings(input: SettingsInput!): Settings
    @auth(productCode: "10", resourceCode: "admin-settings")
}
```

The `@auth` directive checks the caller's License Manager role for the specified `productCode` and `resourceCode`.

## Common failure modes

- **403 for users on role-based routes** — Route only has `policies.json`; users and API keys get 403 because role-based policies don't apply to them.
- **Overly broad `public: true`** — Route set to public when it should be private. Anyone can call it without auth.
- **Missing policy in consumer manifest** — App tries to call a role-based protected route but didn't declare the policy in its `manifest.json`. Results in 403.
- **VRN typo** — Misspelled vendor, app name, or principal format in VRN. Silently fails to match, resulting in 403.
- **Wildcard in deny** — Broad deny with `app/*` blocks all apps including trusted ones. Deny takes precedence.
- **No `@auth` on GraphQL mutations** — Mutations that modify data accessible without role checks.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is the access control type (role-based vs resource-based) correct for the callers (apps vs users/integrations)?
- [ ] Are private routes set to `"public": false` with appropriate policies?
- [ ] Are VRNs correctly formatted for the principal type (apps, users, API keys)?
- [ ] Do consuming apps declare required role-based policies in their `manifest.json`?
- [ ] Are deny rules used carefully (they override allow rules for intersecting principals)?
- [ ] Do GraphQL mutations have `@auth` directives with correct `productCode` and `resourceCode`?
- [ ] Are wildcard principals scoped as narrowly as possible?
