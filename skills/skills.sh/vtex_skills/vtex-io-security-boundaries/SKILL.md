description: "Apply when reviewing or designing security-sensitive boundaries in VTEX IO apps. Covers public versus private exposure, trust assumptions at route and integration boundaries, sensitive data handling, validating what crosses the app boundary, and avoiding leakage across accounts, workspaces, users, or integrations. Use for route hardening, data exposure review, or evaluating whether a service boundary is too permissive."

# Security Boundaries & Exposure Review

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when the main question is whether a VTEX IO route, integration, or service boundary is safe.

- Reviewing public versus private route exposure
- Validating external input at service boundaries
- Handling tokens, account context, or sensitive payloads
- Avoiding cross-account, cross-workspace, or cross-user leakage
- Hardening integrations that expose or consume sensitive data

Do not use this skill for:
- policy declaration syntax in `manifest.json`
- service runtime sizing
- logging and observability strategy
- frontend browser security concerns
- deciding which VTEX auth token should call an endpoint

## Decision rules

- Use this skill to decide what data and input may safely cross the app boundary, not which policies or tokens authorize the call.
- Treat every public route as an explicit trust boundary.
- In `service.json`, changing a route from `public: false` to `public: true` is a boundary change and should trigger explicit security review.
- Use `public: true` for routes that must be callable from outside VTEX IO, such as partner webhooks or externally consumed integration endpoints. Treat them as internet-exposed boundaries.
- Use `public: false` for routes that are meant only for VTEX internal flows or other IO apps, but do not treat them as implicitly safe. They still require validation and scoped assumptions.
- A route with `public: true` in `service.json` is reachable from outside the app as long as the account domain is accessible. Do not rely on obscure paths or internal-looking URLs as a security measure.
- Validate external input as early as possible, before it reaches domain logic or downstream integrations.
- For webhook-style routes, validate both structure and authenticity, for example through required fields plus a shared secret or signature header, before calling downstream clients.
- Do not assume a request is safe because it originated from another VTEX service or internal-looking route path.
- Keep account, workspace, and user context explicit when a service reads or writes scoped data.
- When data or behavior must be restricted to a specific workspace, check `ctx.vtex.workspace` explicitly and reject calls from other workspaces.
- Never expose more data than the caller needs. Shape responses intentionally instead of returning raw downstream payloads.
- Keep secrets, tokens, and security-sensitive headers out of logs and route responses.
- Do not use `console.log` or `console.error` in production routes or services. Use `ctx.vtex.logger` for application logging with structured objects, and only use a dedicated external logging client when the app intentionally forwards logs to a partner-owned system.
- Avoid exposing debug or diagnostic routes that return internal configuration, secrets, or full downstream payloads. If such routes are strictly necessary, keep them non-public and limited to minimal, non-sensitive information.
- Use this skill to decide what may cross the boundary, and use `vtex-io-auth-and-policies` to decide how that boundary is authorized and protected.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Public routes must validate untrusted input at the boundary

Any route exposed beyond a tightly controlled internal boundary MUST validate incoming data before calling domain logic or downstream clients.

**Why this matters**

Unvalidated input at public boundaries creates the fastest path to abuse, bad writes, and accidental downstream failures.

**Detection**

If a public route forwards body fields, params, or headers directly into business logic or client calls without validation, STOP and add validation first.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function webhook(ctx: Context) {
  const body = ctx.request.body

  if (!body?.eventId || !body?.type) {
    ctx.status = 400
    ctx.body = { message: 'Invalid payload' }
    return
  }

  await ctx.clients.partnerApi.handleWebhook(body)
  ctx.status = 202
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function webhook(ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.clients.partnerApi.handleWebhook(ctx.request.body)
  ctx.status = 202
}
```

### Constraint: Sensitive data must not cross route boundaries by accident

Routes and integrations MUST not leak tokens, internal headers, raw downstream payloads, or data that belongs to another account, workspace, or user context.

**Why this matters**

Boundary leaks are hard to detect once deployed and can expose information far beyond the intended caller scope.

**Detection**

If a route returns raw downstream responses, logs secrets, or mixes contexts without explicit filtering, STOP and narrow the output before proceeding.

**Correct**

```typescript
ctx.body = {
  orderId: order.id,
  status: order.status,
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
ctx.body = order
```

### Constraint: Trust boundaries must stay explicit when services call each other

When one service calls another, the receiving boundary MUST still be treated as a real security boundary with explicit validation and scoped assumptions.

**Why this matters**

Internal service-to-service traffic can still carry malformed or overbroad data. Assuming “internal means trusted” leads to fragile security posture and cross-context leakage.

**Detection**

If a service accepts data from another service without validating format, scope, or account/workspace context, STOP and make those checks explicit.

**Correct**

```typescript
if (ctx.vtex.account !== expectedAccount) {
  ctx.status = 403
  return
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
await processPartnerPayload(ctx.request.body)
```

## Preferred pattern

Security review should start at the boundary:

1. Who can call this route or trigger this integration?
2. What data enters the system?
3. What must be validated immediately?
4. What data leaves the system?
5. Could account, workspace, or user context leak across the boundary?

Use minimal request and response shapes, explicit validation, and scoped context checks to keep boundaries safe.

## Common failure modes

- Treating public routes like trusted internal handlers.
- Returning raw downstream payloads that expose more data than necessary.
- Logging secrets or security-sensitive headers.
- Using `console.log` in handlers instead of `ctx.vtex.logger`, making logs less structured and increasing the risk of leaking sensitive data.
- Mixing account or workspace context without explicit checks.
- Assuming service-to-service traffic is inherently safe.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is the trust boundary clear?
- [ ] Are external inputs validated before reaching domain or integration logic?
- [ ] Is the response shape intentionally minimal?
- [ ] Are sensitive values kept out of logs and responses?
- [ ] Could account, workspace, or user context leak across this boundary?
