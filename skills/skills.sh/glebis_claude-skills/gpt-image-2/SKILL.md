Interactive skill that guides users through image creation with style presets, cost-aware draft/final workflow, thinking mode, carousels, and photo editing. This skill should be used when the user requests image generation via OpenAI/GPT Image 2, wants to create social media carousels, edit photos into artistic styles, or needs images with readable text (infographics, diagrams, posters).

# GPT Image 2 — Interactive Image Generation

Generate and edit images via OpenAI's GPT Image 2 API with an interactive, guided workflow.

## Interactive Flow

When the user invokes this skill, guide them through these steps using AskUserQuestion. Do not skip steps — the interactive flow is the core experience.

### Step 1: What are we making?

Ask the user what they want to create. Offer these options:

- **Single image** — one image from a text prompt
- **Photo edit** — transform an existing photo into a style
- **Carousel** — 5-10 cohesive slides for LinkedIn/Instagram
- **Variants** — multiple versions of the same concept
- **Quick generate** — skip questions, just run the prompt

If the user already provided a clear prompt (e.g. "generate an editorial image of a rocket"), skip to Step 3.

### Step 2: Style selection

Show the user available presets grouped by category. Read `presets.yaml` and present them:

**Visual styles** (no text in image):
editorial, blueprint, ink, risograph, wireframe, constellation, brutalist, grain

**Text-heavy** (leverages GPT Image 2 text rendering):
infographic, slide, diagram, poster, menu, manga

**Community favorites:**
trading-card, pixar, app-mockup, isometric, action-figure, cinematic, panorama

**Reference-anchored:**
`vhs` — 1980s late-night infomercial title card: scanline-striped gradient italic caps on pure black. It auto-attaches a bundled reference image (`references/vhs-infomercial.png`), so the look stays consistent batch-to-batch. Pass the ad copy as the subject; for multi-line copy separate lines with ` / ` (e.g. `--preset vhs "THEY TRUSTED YOU / NOW / PROVE IT"`).

**Custom** — user describes their own style

Ask: "Which style? Or describe your own."

### Step 3: Platform & sizing

Ask where this will be used:
- YouTube thumbnail (1280×720)
- Instagram square (1080×1080)
- Slides/presentation (1920×1080)
- Blog hero (1200×630)
- X/Twitter (1600×900)
- Story (1080×1920)
- Custom size
- No resize (use API default)

### Step 3.5: Preflight prompt check (automatic)

Before **any** generation spend, the script now **composes the final prompt first**
(preset + subject + style), then **checks it for internal contradictions** — most often
a preset that hard-codes something the subject overrides (e.g. the `editorial` preset
forces *"on pure black background"* while your subject asks for a warm off-white ground).

The check prefers a fast **Haiku** call via the `llm` CLI; if Haiku is unavailable (no
`llm`, no Anthropic credit) it falls back to the configured `llm` default model, then to a
built-in static heuristic. The resolved prompt and the verdict are printed. **If a conflict
is found, generation is aborted before spending** — fix the prompt or preset and re-run, or
override with `--force` (generate anyway) or `--no-preflight` (skip the check). This is what
prevents the "generated on the wrong background, now regenerate" waste.

When composing prompts that set a background/palette, **don't combine a background-fixing
preset (`editorial`, `blueprint`, etc.) with a different requested background** — either drop
the preset and specify the full style yourself, or accept the preset's background.

### Step 4: Draft first, then final

**Always generate a draft first** unless the user says "skip draft" or uses `--draft false`.

1. Generate with `--draft` (quality=low, ~$0.006/image)
2. Show the image to the user using the Read tool
3. Ask: "Like this direction? I can: (a) generate final quality, (b) adjust the prompt, (c) try a different style, (d) regenerate with a new seed"
4. If approved, generate final with `--quality high` (~$0.21/image)
5. Use `--seed` from the draft to maintain composition when upgrading to final

This draft→final flow saves ~97% on iteration costs.

### Step 5: Show result and offer next actions

After generation, always:
1. Show the image using the Read tool
2. Open it with `open <path>` for full-resolution preview
3. Report the cost
4. Offer: "Want to (a) generate variants, (b) edit this further, (c) use as reference for more images, (d) done?"

## Carousel Workflow

When the user wants a carousel (5-10 slides):

### 1. Story arc
Ask: "What's the story? Give me the key message and I'll draft a 10-slide arc."

Then propose a slide-by-slide plan like:
```
Slide 1: [Cover] — hook headline + hero image
Slide 2: [Problem] — bold statement
Slide 3: [Context] — illustration + explanation
...
Slide 10: [CTA] — call to action with URL
```

Ask the user to approve or modify the plan.

### 2. Style consistency
Use the same preset + seed range across all slides. For carousels:
- Pick one visual style for all slides
- Use `--seed` to lock composition patterns
- Include pagination dots in prompts (e.g., "10 small dots at bottom, third dot highlighted orange")
- Maintain consistent color palette and typography

### 3. Draft batch
Generate all slides as drafts first ($0.006 × 10 = $0.06 total). Show them all to the user as a contact sheet or one by one. Ask which ones to regenerate or adjust.

### 4. Final batch
Only generate finals for approved slides. Offer to generate all at once with `-y` flag.

## Photo Edit Workflow

When the user wants to transform a photo:

1. Ask for the source image (file path or clipboard)
2. For clipboard: save with `osascript` to a temp file
3. Show available styles and ask which to try
4. Generate a draft edit first
5. Show result, ask if they want adjustments
6. Generate final when approved

Use `--edit <path>` for the API call.

## Cost Awareness

Always communicate costs before generating:

| Quality | Per image | 10-slide carousel |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| `--draft` (low) | $0.006 | $0.06 |
| medium | $0.05 | $0.50 |
| high (default) | $0.21 | $2.10 |
| high + thinking | $0.25-0.42 | $2.50-4.20 |

Thinking mode adds 20-100% cost. Only suggest it for text-heavy or complex compositions.

The script auto-confirms when cost < $0.50. Above that, it prompts the user.

## Prompt Engineering Tips

When helping users write prompts, apply these patterns:

1. **Structure**: Scene → Subject → Detail → Lighting → Constraint
2. **Front-load the subject**: put the main thing first
3. **For text in images**: quote exact text with single quotes: `'with the headline "Hello World"'`
4. **Character consistency**: maintain a 5-tuple: age + appearance + hairstyle + distinctive features + clothing
5. **Style tags at end**: append tags like `editorial-magazine`, `studio-product` to converge batches
6. **Use `--seed` for iteration**: lock composition, vary only the prompt details
