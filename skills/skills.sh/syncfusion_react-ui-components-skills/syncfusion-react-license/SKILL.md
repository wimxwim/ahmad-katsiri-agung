## Licensing Overview

Syncfusion license key validation was introduced in the 2022 Volume 1 release (v20.1.0.47) for Essential JS2 platforms. All React applications referencing Syncfusion packages from npm, CDN, or build must register a valid license key to avoid validation warnings.

### Key Licensing Details

**License Key vs Unlock Key:**
- **License Key:** String registered in application code to validate Syncfusion package usage
- **Unlock Key:** Used only during Syncfusion installer process
- **⚠️ Important:** License key is NOT the same as installer unlock key

**Core Requirements:**
- License key validation introduced in v20.1.0.47+ (2022 Volume 1)
- License keys are **version and platform/edition specific**
- Validation occurs **offline** (no internet required during runtime)
- Required when using npm packages or trial installers
- Not required when using licensed installers

**License Types:**
- **Trial license:** 30-day evaluation period, full functionality, generates trial key, displays warning after expiration
- **Community license:** Free for qualifying individuals/organizations (<$1M USD revenue), same functionality as paid license, annual renewal required
- **Paid license:** Commercial license for enterprise use, perpetual or subscription-based, technical support included

**Edition-Based vs Platform-Based:**
- **v31.1.17+ (Edition-based):** UI Edition, Document SDK, PDF Viewer SDK, DOCX Editor SDK, Spreadsheet Editor SDK, Enterprise Edition (all editions combined)
- **v30.x.x and earlier (Platform-based):** React, Angular, Vue, JavaScript, Blazor, etc.

**Build Server Scenarios:**
- **Using npm packages:** License key required - register NPX command
- **Using trial installer:** License key required - trial warnings appear after 30 days
- **Using licensed installer:** License key NOT required - embedded license validation included

**Offline Validation:**
- No internet connection required during application runtime
- License validated locally against package metadata at startup
- Works in air-gapped environments and offline development
- No external API calls or performance impact

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate License Key

Visit [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) page:

**For v31.1.17+ (Edition-based):**
- Select version 31.x.x or higher
- Select required editions: UI Edition, Document SDK, PDF Viewer SDK, DOCX Editor SDK, Spreadsheet Editor SDK
- **Recommended:** Select all 5 editions for Enterprise Edition key
- Click "Get License Key"

**For v30.x.x and earlier (Platform-based):**
- Select version 30.x.x or earlier
- Select platforms: React, JavaScript, etc.
- Click "Get License Key"

### 2. Register License Key in Application

**Recommended Method:** Use environment variables to register your license key. This prevents accidentally committing license keys to source control.

**Step 1:** Set the environment variable:

```bash
# Windows
setx SYNCFUSION_LICENSE "Your_License_Key_Here"

# Mac/Linux
export SYNCFUSION_LICENSE='Your_License_Key_Here'
```

**Step 2:** Activate the license using NPX command:

```bash
npx syncfusion-license activate
```

**Step 3:** Clear the cache:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.cache

# macOS/Linux
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

> **Note:** For alternative license registration methods, kindly refer to the [Syncfusion license key registration documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/licensing/license-key-registration).
