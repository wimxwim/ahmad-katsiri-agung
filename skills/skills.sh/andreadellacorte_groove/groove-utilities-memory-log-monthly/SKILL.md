# groove-utilities-memory-log-monthly

## Outcome

`.groove/memory/monthly/YYYY-MM.md` is created or updated with a roll-up of the month's daily files. Sections cover themes, key outcomes, and learnings at monthly scope.

## Acceptance Criteria

- File exists at `.groove/memory/monthly/YYYY-MM.md` after command completes
- Themes section identifies major recurring topics from the month
- Key outcomes section lists significant completions and milestones
- Learnings section synthesises patterns and insights across the month
- Content is rolled up from daily files — not duplicated raw detail

## Constraints

- Memory path is always `.groove/memory/`
- Only run on the last weekday of the month, or when user explicitly requests
- Roll up from that month's daily files in `.groove/memory/daily/`
- If no daily files exist for the month, note that and exit gracefully
- Use template at `skills/groove-utilities-memory-log-monthly/templates/monthly.md` for file structure
- If file already exists, update rather than overwrite
