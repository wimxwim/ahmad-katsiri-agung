# groove-work-exec

## Outcome

Code, tests, and artifacts are written per the plan. The work task is created/updated in the backend with progress notes. Output is ready for review.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Implementation matches the plan from `/groove-work-plan`
- Work task body tracks progress with dated notes
- Output (code, tests, docs) is complete enough to hand off to `/groove-work-review`
- Stage task created/updated in backend: `YYYY-MM-DD, Work`

## Constraints

- Read `tasks.backend` from `.groove/index.md` to determine backend
- If no prior plan exists, warn the user and ask them to confirm scope before proceeding
- Append progress notes to task body as work proceeds — do not overwrite
- Do not mark task as completed during this stage — that happens after review
- Create stage task via `/groove-utilities-task-create` if `tasks.backend != none` (title `YYYY-MM-DD, Work`)
