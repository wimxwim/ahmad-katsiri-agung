# groove-utilities-memory-log-daily

## Outcome

`.groove/memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` is created or updated with a structured end entry. The file may already exist from daily start (start-of-day structure); if so, append the closeout sections. The file is written so that the next daily start can verify yesterday had an end.

## Acceptance Criteria

- File exists at `.groove/memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` after command completes
- "Done today" section contains granular multi-level bullets sourced from completed tasks and git diff
- Git section summarises commits and changed files for the day
- Tasks section shows task summary by status
- Learnings section is populated (not blank)
- Open/Next section captures carry-forward items
- If file already exists, content is updated/appended rather than overwritten

## Constraints

- Memory path is always `.groove/memory/`
- Write at daily end only — never called at daily start. File may already exist from daily start; append closeout sections rather than overwriting.
- "Done today" must be sourced from: completed tasks (date-matched) and `git diff` output — not from incomplete work
- **Pending capture**: if `.groove/.cache/pending-capture.md` exists (staged by the `session-capture` Stop hook), use it to pre-fill the "Done today" and "Git" sections — its commits/working-changes are the raw material, so the user reviews and edits a draft rather than starting blank. After the daily log is written successfully, delete `.groove/.cache/pending-capture.md`.
- If a completed task has no resolution in its body, ask user for a summary before writing the bullet
- Use template at `skills/groove-utilities-memory-log-daily/templates/daily.md` for file structure
- If the directory `.groove/memory/daily/` does not exist, create it before writing
- Vague entries ("worked on stuff") should trigger a clarification ask before writing
