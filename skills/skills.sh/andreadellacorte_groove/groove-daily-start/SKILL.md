# groove-daily-start

## Outcome

The workday is prepared: recent days are reviewed, today's daily memory file is created, tasks are consolidated and presented, and the user knows what to work on.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Yesterday's daily memory file is reviewed (summary shown; warn if missing or no end section)
- Today's daily memory file is created with a start-of-day structure (if it does not already exist)
- Task list is loaded and presented (grouped by status)
- User has a clear picture of the day's agenda before starting work

## Constraints

- Read `.groove/index.md` for `tasks.backend` and `memory.review_days` config
- Memory path is always `.groove/memory/`
- Call `/groove-utilities-task-analyse` to get current task state
- **Review recent days:** If `.groove/memory/daily/` is empty (no files exist), skip this step entirely and note "Fresh install — no prior logs." Otherwise, identify the last `memory.review_days` business days (Mon–Fri) counting back from yesterday (skip Saturday and Sunday). For each date:
  - Check `.groove/memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:
    - `✓ YYYY-MM-DD — start + end logged` if both start-of-day and end sections exist
    - `~ YYYY-MM-DD — start only, no end logged` if only start section present
    - `✗ YYYY-MM-DD — missing` if file does not exist
    - Show a one-line context from the file if present (e.g. first bullet from "Done today" or plan intent)
  - Show git activity: run `git log --oneline --after="YYYY-MM-DD 00:00" --before="YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59"` — display commit count and first few titles; skip silently if not in a git repo or no commits
  - Do NOT block start if files are missing or incomplete — just report
- **Create new day memory:** Create today's file at `.groove/memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` using the template at `skills/groove-daily-start/templates/daily-start.md`. If the file already exists, skip (idempotent). Create `.groove/memory/daily/` if missing.
- After the recent-days review, check for open promises via `/groove-utilities-memory-promises --list`:
  - If open promises: show inline note: `→ N open promise(s) — run /groove-utilities-memory-promises --list to review`
  - If none: skip silently
- After the recent-days review, check for open mistake incidents via `/groove-utilities-memory-mistakes --list`:
  - If open incidents: show inline warning: `⚠ N open incident(s) — resolve at next /groove-work-compound`
  - If none: skip silently
- Do NOT modify tasks during start
- Present task list in a scannable format before the user begins
- After all standard steps: check if `.groove/hooks/start.md` exists
  - If it exists: read the `## Actions` section and execute each item in order; report completion per item
  - If it does not exist: skip silently
