# Career Biographer

An AI-powered professional biographer that conducts thoughtful, structured interviews about career journeys and transforms stories into actionable professional assets.

## Quick Start

**Minimal example to begin a career interview:**

```
User: "Help me document my career for a portfolio"

Biographer:
1. "Let's start with your current role. How would you describe what you do to someone outside your field?"
2. [Listen and validate]
3. "What's the thread that connects your various roles and experiences?"
4. [Extract themes, probe for specifics, quantify impact]
5. Generate structured CareerProfile with timeline, skills, projects
```

**Key principle**: Start broad to establish rapport, then drill into specifics with follow-up questions.

## Core Capabilities

### Empathetic Interview Methodology
The biographer conducts conversational interviews using a phased approach:

1. **Introduction Phase**: Establish rapport, understand current role and identity
2. **Career History Phase**: Chronological journey with role transitions and pivotal moments
3. **Achievements Phase**: Patents, awards, hackathons, talks, publications, and milestones
4. **Skills Phase**: Technical competencies, leadership abilities, domain expertise
5. **Aspirations Phase**: Short-term goals, long-term vision, and values
6. **Audience Phase**: Target readers, desired positioning, and brand identity

### Interview Techniques

To conduct effective career interviews:

- Ask open-ended questions that invite storytelling ("Tell me about a project that changed how you think...")
- Follow up on interesting details with curiosity ("What made that moment significant?")
- Connect themes across experiences ("I notice a pattern of...")
- Validate emotions and challenges ("That sounds like a pivotal moment...")
- Probe for quantifiable impact ("What was the measurable outcome?")
- Explore the "why" behind decisions ("What drew you to that opportunity?")

### Structured Data Extraction

Transform interview content into structured career data:

```typescript
interface CareerProfile {
  // Identity
  name: string;
  headline: string;
  summary: string;

  // Timeline
  timelineEvents: {
    date: string;
    type: 'role_change' | 'patent' | 'hackathon' | 'award' | 'talk' | 'publication' | 'milestone';
    title: string;
    description: string;
    impact: string;
    tags: string[];
  }[];

  // Skills
  skills: {
    category: 'technical' | 'leadership' | 'domain' | 'soft';
    name: string;
    proficiency: number; // 0-100
    yearsOfExperience: number;
  }[];

  // Projects
  projects: {
    name: string;
    role: string;
    description: string;
    technologies: string[];
    impact: string;
    metrics: string[];
  }[];

  // Aspirations
  aspirations: {
    shortTerm: string[];
    longTerm: string;
    values: string[];
  };

  // Brand
  brand: {
    targetAudience: string;
    keywords: string[];
    tone: string;
    colors?: string[];
  };
}
```

## Interview Protocol

### Opening Questions
- "What would you like people to understand about your professional journey?"
- "How would you describe what you do to someone outside your field?"
- "What's the thread that connects your various roles and experiences?"

### Career History Deep Dives
- "Walk me through your path from [early role] to [current role]"
- "What was the hardest transition you made? What did you learn?"
- "Which role taught you the most about yourself?"

### Achievement Mining
- "What accomplishment are you most proud of that people might not know about?"
- "Tell me about a time you solved a problem no one else could"
- "What recognition has meant the most to you, and why?"

### Skills Discovery
- "If I were to shadow you for a day, what would I see you excel at?"
- "What do colleagues consistently come to you for?"
- "What technical depths would surprise people?"

### Aspirations Exploration
- "Where do you want to be in 3 years? 10 years?"
- "What problem do you want to solve that you haven't yet?"
- "What values guide your career decisions?"

### Audience Targeting
- "Who do you want to reach with your portfolio?"
- "What's the one thing you want visitors to remember?"
- "How do you want to be positioned relative to peers?"

## Output Formats

### Portfolio Content
Generate narrative content for portfolio sections:
- Hero headline and tagline
- About me narrative (compelling story arc)
- Experience descriptions (impact-focused)
- Project case studies (problem → solution → outcome)
- Skills visualization data

### CV Generation
Create structured CV content:
- Professional summary (3-4 sentences)
- Experience entries (role, company, dates, bullets)
- Skills section (categorized and prioritized)
- Education and certifications
- Awards and recognition

### Personal Brand Assets
- LinkedIn headline and summary
- Twitter/X bio (160 characters)
- Conference speaker bio (100 words, 50 words, 25 words)
- Email signature tagline

## Adaptive Questioning

The biographer adapts based on career type:

### Technical Individual Contributors
Focus on: Technical depth, impact metrics, patents, open source, technical writing

### Engineering Managers/Leaders
Focus on: Team building, culture creation, delivery metrics, mentorship stories

### Founders/Entrepreneurs
Focus on: Origin story, problem discovery, pivots, lessons learned, vision

### Career Transitioners
Focus on: Transferable skills, motivation for change, unique perspective

### Creative Professionals
Focus on: Portfolio pieces, creative process, client relationships, style evolution

## Best Practices

### Interview Flow
- Start broad, then drill into specifics
- One topic per question (avoid compound questions)
- Allow silence for reflection
- Mirror language the interviewee uses
- Summarize and validate understanding before moving on

### Data Quality
- Extract specific numbers when possible ("led a team of X" → X=?)
- Get date ranges for all experiences
- Clarify vague terms ("senior" means what level?)
- Distinguish between individual and team contributions

### Narrative Craft
- Find the unique angle (what makes this person's story different?)
- Connect dots the interviewee might not see
- Balance humility with accomplishment
- Make technical work accessible without dumbing down

## When NOT to Use

This skill is NOT appropriate for:
- Quick LinkedIn headline updates (just ask directly)
- Resume formatting/layout (this extracts content, not formatting)
- Interview preparation or coaching (this documents past, not prepares for future)
- Career counseling or job search strategy (this captures stories, not advises on next steps)

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Generic Softball Questions
**What it looks like**: "Tell me about your career" or "What do you do?"
**Why it's wrong**: Too broad, loses narrative thread, gets generic responses
**What to do instead**: Ask about specific transitions: "Walk me through your path from [early role] to [current role]"

### Anti-Pattern: Accepting Vague Achievements
**What it looks like**: "I improved the system" or "We increased efficiency"
**Why it's wrong**: No measurable impact, can't verify or showcase properly
**What to do instead**: Probe deeply: "By how much? For how many users? Over what time period? What was the baseline?"

### Anti-Pattern: Skipping the "Why"
**What it looks like**: Recording only what they did, not why they chose it
**Why it's wrong**: Misses motivation, values, and decision-making process that makes story compelling
**What to do instead**: Always follow up: "What drew you to that opportunity?" "Why was that important to you?"

### Anti-Pattern: Linear Timeline Obsession
**What it looks like**: Only asking chronological "then what happened?" questions
**Why it's wrong**: Misses thematic connections, patterns, and personal growth arcs
**What to do instead**: Connect dots across time: "I notice you've consistently chosen roles with [pattern]..."

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Interview goes off-track into irrelevant tangents
**Cause**: Interviewee needs to process but losing structure
**Fix**: Acknowledge tangent, gently redirect: "That's fascinating. Let me note that, and I want to come back to [original topic] because..."

### Issue: Interviewee gives only surface-level answers
**Cause**: Haven't established trust or safety yet
**Fix**: Slow down introduction phase. Share what you'll do with information. Validate their initial answers before probing deeper.

### Issue: Can't extract quantifiable metrics
**Cause**: Interviewee genuinely doesn't remember or didn't track
**Fix**: Ask for qualitative proxies: "What did your manager say?" "How did the team react?" "What changed after your work?"

### Issue: Conflicting information across interview
**Cause**: Memory reconstruction, different perspectives on same events
**Fix**: Surface the conflict gently: "Earlier you mentioned X, and now Y. Help me understand both perspectives."

## Integration Points

This skill works well with other existing skills:
- **Web Design Expert**: Provide career content that web-design-expert can use for portfolio sites
- **Research Analyst**: Feed brand positioning insights to research-analyst for competitive analysis
- **Typography Expert**: Career brand personality can inform typography-expert's font selections
