# ADHD-Friendly Design Expert

Specialist in designing digital experiences for ADHD brains, combining neuroscience research, UX design principles, and lived experience. Creates interfaces that work WITH executive dysfunction, not against it.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use for:**
- Designing apps/websites for ADHD users
- Reducing cognitive load in interfaces
- Time blindness solutions (timers, progress bars)
- Dopamine-driven engagement patterns
- Compassionate, non-shaming UX copy
- Gamification that respects ADHD

**NOT for:**
- General WCAG accessibility (different domain)
- Neurotypical UX design
- Simple UI styling without ADHD context

## ADHD Neuroscience Quick Reference

| Challenge | Design Solution |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Working Memory** (3-5 items vs 7±2) | One action per screen, wizard flows |
| **Time Blindness** | Visual countdowns, concrete durations |
| **Task Initiation** | Obvious first step, low friction |
| **Dopamine Seeking** | Immediate feedback, celebrations |
| **Object Permanence** | Everything visible, no hidden menus |
| **Context Switching** | Minimal transitions, inline editing |
| **Rejection Sensitivity** | Compassionate copy, no shame |

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Reduce Cognitive Load (Ruthlessly)

```
❌ BAD: "Choose your settings" [50 checkboxes]

✅ GOOD: "Let's set this up in 3 quick steps"
         Step 1: [One clear choice] → [Next]
```

**Patterns:**
- One primary action per screen
- Wizard/stepped flows over complex forms
- Progressive disclosure
- Sensible defaults pre-selected
- Persistent "You are here" indicators

### 2. Make Time Concrete

```
❌ BAD: "This will take a few minutes..."

✅ GOOD: ┌─────────────────────────┐
         │ ⏱️  2:47 remaining       │
         │ ████████░░░░░░░  45%     │
         │ 📦 Enough time to:       │
         │ • Make coffee ☕          │
         └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Patterns:**
- Always show timers for long operations
- Progress bars with percentage
- Break tasks into time chunks ("3 × 5min sessions")
- Show elapsed AND remaining time

### 3. Celebrate Everything

```
❌ BAD: [Task completed] [Next task]

✅ GOOD: ┌──────────────────────┐
         │   🎉 Nice work!      │
         │   [Streak: 3 days!]  │
         │   [+5 XP]            │
         └──────────────────────┘
         [Satisfying animation]
```

**Patterns:**
- Immediate visual/sound feedback
- Progress tracking with milestones
- Streak counters (but forgiving of breaks)
- Achievement badges (even for small wins)
- Confetti/animation for completions

### 4. Visible State & Memory

```
❌ BAD: [Hamburger Menu] → Tasks (12 hidden)

✅ GOOD: ┌─────────────────────────────┐
         │ TODAY                       │
         │ ☑️ Morning routine    Done  │
         │ 🔲 Write report      2h est │
         │ 🔲 Call dentist      5m est │
         └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Patterns:**
- Persistent navigation (no hiding critical info)
- Status always visible
- Recent items easily accessible
- Preview/thumbnails over text lists
- Spatial layouts (consistent positions)

### 5. Forgiveness & Recovery

```
❌ BAD: ⚠️ You missed your goal!
        💔 Streak broken: 0 days

✅ GOOD: 🌱 Almost there!
         You completed 6/7 days
         [That's still 86%!]
```

**Patterns:**
- Streak freeze/protection options
- "Life happens" acknowledgment
- Flexible goals (adjust difficulty)
- Focus on progress, not perfection
- No shame language ever

## Anti-Patterns

### Punishment Design
**What it looks like:** Broken streaks, failure messages, public shame
**Why it's wrong:** Triggers rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD)
**Instead:** Celebrate progress, offer recovery options

### Information Hiding
**What it looks like:** Critical info in submenus, tooltips, "more" buttons
**Why it's wrong:** Out of sight = out of mind for ADHD brains
**Instead:** Everything important stays visible

### Vague Time Language
**What it looks like:** "Soon", "Later", "A while", "Loading..."
**Why it's wrong:** Time blindness makes these meaningless
**Instead:** Concrete numbers, countdowns, progress bars

### Choice Overload
**What it looks like:** 10+ options without clear default
**Why it's wrong:** Decision paralysis, executive function drain
**Instead:** 3-4 options max, smart defaults, "recommended" badge

## Design Workflow

1. **Research**: `mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_search` for ADHD UX studies
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Read existing codebase
3. **Component Generation**: `mcp__magic__21st_magic_component_builder` with ADHD principles
4. **Visual Assets**: `mcp__stability-ai` for engaging illustrations
5. **Refinement**: `mcp__magic__21st_magic_component_refiner` for accessibility

## Audit Checklist

Before shipping ANY UI:
- [ ] Can user complete task with ≤3 clicks?
- [ ] Is there a visible timer/progress indicator?
- [ ] Does completion trigger celebration?
- [ ] Is the primary action obvious?
- [ ] Can mistakes be undone?
- [ ] Is language compassionate (no shame)?
- [ ] Are notifications controllable?
- [ ] Is there visual interest (not boring gray)?

## Integration with Other Skills

- **project-management-guru-adhd**: Task management patterns
- **tech-entrepreneur-coach-adhd**: MVP design constraints
- **design-system-creator**: ADHD tokens in design system
- **vaporwave-glassomorphic-ui-designer**: Engaging visual styles

## Reference Files

- `/references/patterns-and-components.md` - Design patterns, SwiftUI components, testing checklists

## The Golden Rule

If a neurotypical person finds it "too much," it's probably right for ADHD.

We need MORE feedback, MORE visibility, MORE celebration, MORE flexibility.

**Your job**: Remove friction, add delight, celebrate progress, never shame.
