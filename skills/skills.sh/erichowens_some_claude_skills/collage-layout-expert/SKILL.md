# Collage & Layout Composition Expert

Expert in **ALL forms of computational collage composition** - from Instagram grids to Hockney joiners, from magazine layouts to generative art.

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Use for:**
- **Grid Collages**: Instagram profiles, regular layouts, tiled compositions
- **Photo Mosaics**: Small images forming larger pictures
- **Hockney-Style Joiners**: Multi-perspective photographic assemblies
- **Scrapbook/Journal**: Mixed media with text, frames, embellishments
- **Magazine/Editorial**: Professional layouts with text integration
- **Vision/Mood Boards**: Inspiration collections, design references
- **Memory Walls**: Scattered Polaroid-style arrangements
- **Social Media**: Stories, carousel previews, profile grids
- **Abstract/Generative**: Algorithmic and procedural arrangements
- **Art-Historical**: Dadaist, Surrealist, Pop Art styles

❌ **Do NOT use for:**
- Simple image editing → **native-app-designer**
- Generating new images → **Stability AI**
- Single photo quality → **photo-composition-critic**
- Image similarity search → **clip-aware-embeddings**
- Color palette extraction → **color-theory-palette-harmony-expert**

## Expert vs Novice Shibboleths

| Topic | Novice | Expert |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Layout** | "Just arrange randomly" | Visual weight, balance, golden ratio |
| **Blending** | Hard edges or simple feather | Poisson blending preserves gradients |
| **Color** | "Match colors manually" | Optimal transport; LAB space advantages |
| **Composition** | Fills all space | Negative space as design element |
| **Scale** | Same size for everything | Varies scale for hierarchy |
| **Mosaic** | "More tiles = better" | Tile size vs. recognition tradeoff |
| **Hockney** | "Stitch seamlessly" | Imperfection IS the technique |

## Decision Tree: Choosing a Style

**What's the purpose?**
- Systematic display → **Grid Collage**
- Artistic portrait from photos → **Photo Mosaic**
- Personal memories → **Scrapbook** or **Memory Wall**
- Design inspiration → **Mood Board**
- Professional/publication → **Magazine Layout**
- Social media → **Social Templates**
- Art project → **Hockney/Dadaist/Surrealist**

**What's the vibe?**
- Clean, modern → Grid with tight gutters
- Nostalgic, warm → Polaroid scatter, vintage frames
- Edgy, disruptive → Dadaist sharp cuts
- Dreamy, surreal → Seamless Poisson blending
- Cubist, intellectual → Hockney joiners

## Core Algorithms (Summary)

| Algorithm | Use Case | Performance |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Edge-Based Assembly** | Hockney joiners | 0.5s for 10 photos |
| **Poisson Blending** | Seamless transitions | 20ms (512×512) |
| **Optimal Transport** | Color harmonization | Real-time w/ affine approx |
| **Force-Directed** | Organic scatter | 200ms (50 images) |
| **K-d Tree Matching** | Photo mosaic tiles | 2s for 10k tiles |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Ignoring Visual Weight
**What it looks like**: All images same size, random placement
**Why it's wrong**: No focal point, viewer's eye wanders aimlessly
**Fix**: Establish 60/30/10 hierarchy with one hero image

### 2. Over-Saturating the Canvas
**What it looks like**: Every pixel filled with image content
**Why it's wrong**: Visual claustrophobia, no breathing room
**Fix**: Use negative space intentionally (20-30% white space minimum)

### 3. Linear FFT for Color Matching
**What it looks like**: Poor perceptual color matches
**Why it's wrong**: RGB is not perceptually uniform
**Fix**: Use LAB color space for matching

### 4. Seamless Hockney Joiners
**What it looks like**: Perfectly stitched panorama
**Why it's wrong**: Misses the entire point - multiple perspectives
**Fix**: Embrace ±2° rotation variance, 5-15% overlap, intentional gaps

### 5. Global Poisson Blending
**What it looks like**: Entire image becomes washed out
**Why it's wrong**: Destroys local contrast, looks fake
**Fix**: Apply locally at seams only, preserve source gradients

### 6. Reusing Mosaic Tiles
**What it looks like**: Obvious repetition patterns in mosaic
**Why it's wrong**: Human eye detects patterns immediately
**Fix**: Track tile usage, penalize reuse, use larger tile library

## MCP Integrations

| MCP | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Stability AI** | Generate backgrounds, textures, missing elements |
| **Firecrawl** | Research techniques, algorithm papers, art history |
| **WebFetch** | Fetch documentation, tutorials, design references |

## Performance Targets

| Operation | Mac M2 | iPhone 15 Pro |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Grid layout (20 photos) | &lt;50ms | &lt;100ms |
| Photo mosaic (10k tiles) | 2s | 5s |
| Force-directed (50 images) | 200ms | 500ms |
| Poisson blending (512×512) | 20ms | 50ms |
| Hockney assembly (10 photos) | 0.5s | 2s |

**Remember**: Great collages tell stories through arrangement. Whether grid-precise or Hockney-chaotic, the layout serves the narrative. Master both the math and the art.
