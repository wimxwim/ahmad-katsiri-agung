# Job Application Optimizer

Strategic job application planning and "Resume SEO" optimization. This skill teaches Claude to approach job applications like a marketing campaign - researching the market, qualifying opportunities, and optimizing content for maximum conversion.

## When to Activate

Activate on:
- "optimize my resume for this job"
- "should I apply to this job"
- "tailor my resume"
- "ATS optimization"
- "keyword optimization"
- "job search strategy"
- "application strategy"
- "resume SEO"
- "job fit score"

NOT for:
- Initial career narrative creation (use career-biographer)
- Portfolio website design (use cv-creator directly)
- Market positioning analysis (use competitive-cartographer)
- General resume formatting (use cv-creator directly)

## Core Philosophy: Resume SEO

Treat job applications like search engine optimization:

| SEO Concept | Resume Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Search query | Job description |
| Web page | Resume |
| Keywords | Skills & requirements |
| Meta description | Professional summary |
| H1 heading | Job title/headline |
| Content quality | Achievement metrics |
| Keyword density | Skills frequency (2-4% optimal) |
| Backlinks | Referrals & endorsements |
| Page speed | Scan time (&lt;6 seconds) |

## Strategic Framework

### 1. Opportunity Qualification

Before optimizing, determine if the job is worth applying to:

**APPLY signals:**
- Match score &gt;65% on core requirements
- &lt;3 years experience gap
- Transferable skills cover &gt;50% of gaps
- Company culture aligns (green flags)
- Compensation in range

**SKIP signals:**
- Match score &lt;50% with hard blockers
- &gt;5 years experience gap
- Required certifications you don't have
- Multiple red flags (rockstar, wear many hats)
- Major relocation required (if not willing)

### 2. Keyword Research

Like SEO keyword research, extract and prioritize:

**Primary Keywords (must include):**
- Job title (exact match)
- Top 5 required skills
- Required certifications
- Industry/domain terms

**Secondary Keywords (should include):**
- Preferred skills
- Technology stack specifics
- Methodology terms (Agile, Scrum)

**Long-tail Keywords (nice to have):**
- Specific tools mentioned
- Soft skills emphasized
- Cultural values expressed

### 3. Tailoring Levels

**LIGHT Tailoring** (match &gt;80%)
- Time: 15 minutes
- Reorder skills to match job priority
- Add 2-3 missing keywords to summary
- Ensure job title alignment
- Risk: None

**MEDIUM Tailoring** (match 60-80%)
- Time: 30 minutes
- Rewrite summary with top keywords
- Add skills section entries
- Emphasize relevant experience bullets
- Add 1-2 relevant projects
- Risk: Low

**AGGRESSIVE Tailoring** (match 50-65%)
- Time: 1 hour
- Complete summary rewrite
- Restructure skills by relevance
- Modify experience bullets with keywords
- Add quantifiable metrics
- Create variant resume
- Risk: Medium (over-optimization possible)

### 4. ATS Optimization Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

**Format:**
- [ ] Single-column layout
- [ ] Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Georgia)
- [ ] No tables, columns, text boxes
- [ ] No headers/footers (info gets lost)
- [ ] PDF or DOCX (DOCX preferred for ATS)
- [ ] No images or graphics

**Structure:**
- [ ] Contact info at top (not in header)
- [ ] Standard section headers
- [ ] Reverse chronological order
- [ ] Consistent date format (Month YYYY)
- [ ] 1-2 pages maximum

**Content:**
- [ ] Word count 400-800
- [ ] 5+ quantifiable achievements
- [ ] Action verbs at bullet start
- [ ] No buzzwords/clichés
- [ ] Keywords in first 1/3 of resume

**Keywords:**
- [ ] Keyword density 2-4%
- [ ] Both acronyms and full forms (AWS/Amazon Web Services)
- [ ] Skills in dedicated section
- [ ] Keywords in summary
- [ ] Exact match for proper nouns

### 5. Application Batch Strategy

For job search campaigns:

**Daily:**
- Apply to 5-10 jobs (quality over quantity)
- Track applications in spreadsheet
- Follow up on week-old applications

**Weekly:**
- Review which resumes got responses
- A/B test resume variants
- Adjust keyword strategy based on results

**Monthly:**
- Analyze conversion rates
- Update master resume with new achievements
- Refresh networking outreach

## Tool Integration

This skill works with:

**cv-creator-mcp:**
```
analyze_job → score_match → suggest_tailoring → score_ats
```

**career-biographer:**
Provides the structured CareerProfile that cv-creator-mcp uses.

**competitive-cartographer:**
Provides positioning strategy and differentiators.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keyword Stuffing** - &gt;4% density triggers spam filters
2. **Generic Resume** - Same resume for every application
3. **Ignoring ATS** - Pretty resumes that machines can't read
4. **Over-tailoring** - Claims that can't be backed up
5. **Skipping Cover Letter** - Many ATS weight it heavily
6. **Wrong File Format** - PNG/JPG images of resumes
7. **Missing Contact** - Email in header that ATS loses
