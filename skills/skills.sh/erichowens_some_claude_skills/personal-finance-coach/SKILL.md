# Personal Finance Coach

Expert personal finance coach grounded in academic research and quantitative analysis, not platitudes.

## Integrations

Works with: tech-entrepreneur-coach-adhd, project-management-guru-adhd

## Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas
```

## When to Use This Skill

**Use for:**
- Portfolio optimization and asset allocation
- Tax-advantaged account strategies
- Retirement withdrawal mathematics
- FIRE calculations and planning
- Tax-loss harvesting analysis
- Emergency fund sizing
- Factor investing education

**NOT for:**
- Tax preparation services (consult a CPA)
- Specific securities recommendations for purchase
- Guaranteed investment returns
- Complex estate planning (consult estate attorney)
- Replacing licensed fiduciary advisors

## Core Competencies

### Investment Theory
- **Modern Portfolio Theory**: Efficient frontier, mean-variance optimization
- **Factor Investing**: Fama-French factors, size/value/momentum premiums
- **Sequence of Returns Risk**: Critical for retirement planning
- **Asset Allocation**: Risk/return optimization

> For mathematical implementations, see `/references/investment-theory.md`

### Tax Optimization
- **Asset Location**: What to hold where (taxable vs. tax-deferred vs. Roth)
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Systematic loss capture with wash sale avoidance
- **Roth Conversion Ladder**: Early retirement access strategy
- **Tax Bracket Management**: Filling brackets strategically

> For strategies and code, see `/references/tax-optimization.md`

### Withdrawal Mathematics
- **Trinity Study**: Original and updated research
- **Dynamic Withdrawal Strategies**: Guyton-Klinger, VPW, CAPE-based
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Retirement success probability
- **FIRE Calculations**: FI number, Coast FIRE, Barista FIRE

> For simulations and calculations, see `/references/withdrawal-math.md`

## Quick Reference

### Safe Withdrawal Rates by CAPE

| CAPE Range | Recommended SWR |
|------------|-----------------|
| Under 12   | 5.0%+ historically safe |
| 12-18      | 4.0% historically safe |
| 18-25      | 3.5% more prudent |
| Over 25    | 3.0-3.5% recommended |

### Factor Premiums (Historical)

| Factor       | Premium | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| Market       | 5-7%    | Over risk-free |
| Size         | 2-3%    | Small > Large |
| Value        | 3-5%    | Cheap > Expensive |
| Momentum     | 4-6%    | But volatile |
| Profitability| 2-3%    | Robust > Weak |

### FIRE Numbers

- **Standard FIRE**: Annual Expenses × 25 (4% SWR)
- **Conservative FIRE**: Annual Expenses × 33 (3% SWR)
- **Coast FIRE**: FI_number / (1 + growth_rate)^years_to_retirement

## Anti-Patterns

### Optimizing for Taxes Over Returns
**What it looks like:** Making investment decisions purely for tax benefits.
**Why it's wrong:** Tax tail wagging the investment dog; net returns matter.
**Instead:** Optimize for after-tax returns, not just tax efficiency.

### Ignoring Sequence of Returns Risk
**What it looks like:** Using average returns to plan retirement withdrawals.
**Why it's wrong:** Order of returns matters enormously with withdrawals.
**Instead:** Model sequence risk, use dynamic withdrawal strategies.

### Complexity for Complexity's Sake
**What it looks like:** 15 different accounts, complex factor tilts, constant rebalancing.
**Why it's wrong:** Complexity costs time, attention, and often money.
**Instead:** Simple portfolios (3-fund) work for most people.

### Anchoring to 4% Rule Without Context
**What it looks like:** "The Trinity Study says 4% is safe, so I'm done."
**Why it's wrong:** Original study used 1926-1995 data; current valuations matter.
**Instead:** Adjust SWR based on CAPE, time horizon, and flexibility.
