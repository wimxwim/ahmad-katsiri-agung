# AI Video Production Master

Expert in script-to-video production pipelines for Apple Silicon Macs. Specializes in:
- **Multiple video approaches**: Stock footage, T2V (Sora-style), I2V, hybrid
- Hybrid local/cloud workflows for cost optimization
- Style and character consistency (LoRA, IPAdapter, prompt discipline)
- Motion graphics and synthetic elements (title cards, data viz, lower thirds)
- Artist commissioning for training datasets
- Cloud GPU orchestration (Vast.ai, RunPod)

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill for:**
- Script-to-video production pipelines
- Stock footage assembly (InVideo-style workflows)
- Text-to-video generation (Sora, Runway, Pika, Kling)
- Image-to-video animation (Wan I2V, ComfyUI)
- Cloud GPU orchestration (Vast.ai, RunPod, Lambda)
- Motion graphics generation (title cards, lower thirds, data viz)
- LoRA training for character/style consistency
- Artist commissioning for training datasets
- Cost optimization between local and cloud processing

❌ **DO NOT use for:**
- Real-time video editing → use DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro
- Video effects/compositing → use After Effects, Fusion
- Audio production/mixing → use `sound-engineer` skill
- 3D modeling/animation → use Blender, Maya, or `physics-rendering-expert` skill
- Static image generation → use `clip-aware-embeddings` or image gen tools

## Video Generation Approaches

Choose the right approach based on your content:

### Stock Footage (Invideo-style) - RECOMMENDED for most content
Best for: Educational, corporate, explainers, documentaries
- Uses curated stock libraries (Pexels, Pixabay, Storyblocks)
- Most professional, reliable results
- Fast turnaround (~30 min for full video)
- Script → AI selects matching clips → voiceover + music
```bash
python scripts/stock_video_generator.py --script script.txt --style documentary
```

### Text-to-Video (Sora-style) - For creative/artistic content
Best for: Abstract visuals, creative shorts, unique scenes
- True generative AI (no stock footage)
- Uses: Sora API, Runway Gen-3, Pika, Kling
- Cleaner than I2V (no weird image artifacts)
- Storyboard control for multi-shot narratives
```bash
python scripts/t2v_generator.py --prompt "A serene mountain lake at sunset" --provider sora
```

### Image-to-Video (I2V) - For animating specific images
Best for: Animating logos, concept art, specific compositions
- Animates existing images with subtle motion
- Can look "weird" if source images are AI-generated
- Best with clean, professional source images
```bash
python scripts/cloud_i2v_batch.py --images ./keyframes --provider vastai
```

### Hybrid Approach
Combine approaches per shot:
- Shot 1-3: Stock footage (b-roll, establishing)
- Shot 4-5: T2V (creative transitions)
- Shot 6-10: Stock footage (talking head, outro)

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Cost Optimization
Compare and recommend the optimal mix of local (M4 Max) vs cloud (H100/A100) processing:
```bash
python scripts/cost_calculator.py --shots 10 --duration 5
```

### 2. Cloud Batch Processing
Run I2V generation on cloud GPUs for 50x speedup:
```bash
python scripts/cloud_i2v_batch.py --images ./keyframes --provider vastai
```

### 3. Motion Graphics Generation
Create professional title cards, lower thirds, and data visualizations:
```bash
python scripts/motion_graphics_generator.py --type title --style deep_glow --title "Your Title"
```

### 4. Style Consistency
Provide guidance on:
- LoRA training parameters (rank, alpha, learning rate, steps)
- IPAdapter + FaceID for character consistency
- Prompt discipline and trigger words
- Reference image workflows

### 5. Artist Commissioning
Templates and guidance for:
- Finding artists (ArtStation, Fiverr, Upwork)
- Structuring commission requests
- AI training rights contracts
- Quality control and review processes

## Quick Reference

### Cost Comparison (10-shot video)
| Approach | Time | Cost | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Stock Footage + AI | 30 min | Free-$20/mo | Educational, corporate |
| Sora (ChatGPT Plus) | 30 min | $20/mo | Creative, unique scenes |
| Full Local I2V (M4 Max) | 15+ hours | $0 | When you need specific images |
| Cloud I2V (RTX 4090) | 30 min | ~$0.50 | Batch I2V processing |
| InVideo Max | 30 min | $48/mo | Full automation |
| Runway Gen-3 | 30 min | ~$15-25 | High-quality T2V |

### Cloud GPU Pricing
| Provider | GPU | $/hr | I2V Time/Clip |
|----------|-----|------|---------------|
