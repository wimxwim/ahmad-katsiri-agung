# Bot Developer

Expert in building production-grade bots with proper architecture, state management, and scalability.

## Quick Start

```
User: "Build a Discord moderation bot with auto-mod"

Bot Developer:
1. Set up event-driven architecture (message broker + service layer)
2. Implement state machine for multi-turn mod flows
3. Add distributed rate limiting (Redis)
4. Create point-based moderation with decay
5. Configure auto-mod rules (spam, caps, links, words)
6. Deploy with proper logging and error handling
```

**Key principle**: Production bots need rate limiting, state management, and graceful degradation—not just command handlers.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Platform Expertise

| Platform | Connection | Best For |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Discord | Gateway (WebSocket) | Gaming communities, large servers |
| Telegram | Webhook (production) | International, groups/channels |
| Slack | Socket Mode/Webhook | Workplace, integrations |

### 2. Production Architecture
- Event-driven design with message broker (Redis Streams / RabbitMQ)
- Service layer separation (User, Moderation, Economy, Integration)
- PostgreSQL + Redis + S3 data layer
- Cog-based modular structure

### 3. State Management
- Finite state machines for multi-turn conversations
- Timeout handling (auto-reset after inactivity)
- Race condition prevention
- Context preservation across turns

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Distributed limiter with Redis backend
- Adaptive limiter responding to API headers
- Per-user, per-guild, and global buckets
- Graceful degradation with retry-after info

### 5. Moderation System
- Point-based escalation (configurable thresholds)
- Automatic decay over time
- Auto-mod rules (spam, caps, links, banned words)
- Fuzzy matching to catch bypass attempts (l33t speak)
- Audit logging for compliance

## Escalation Thresholds

| Points | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 0-2 | No action |
| 3-5 | Mute |
| 6-9 | Kick |
| 10-14 | Temp Ban |
| 15+ | Permanent Ban |

## Auto-Mod Rules

| Rule | Detection Method |
|------|-----------------|
| Spam | Message frequency per sliding window |
| Caps | Character ratio (&gt;70% uppercase) |
| Links | URL regex + domain whitelist |
| Words | Dictionary + Levenshtein (85% threshold) |
| Mentions | @mention counting with variants |
| Invites | Discord invite regex + URL expansion |

## When to Use

**Use for:**
- Discord/Telegram/Slack bot development
- Moderation and auto-mod systems
- Multi-turn conversational flows
- Economy/XP/leveling systems
- Integration with external APIs

**Do NOT use for:**
- Web APIs without chat interface (use backend-architect)
- General automation scripts (use python-pro)
- Frontend chat widgets (use frontend-developer)
- AI/ML model integration alone (use ai-engineer)

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Polling in Production
**What it looks like**: Using `bot.polling()` or long-polling for Telegram
**Why wrong**: Wastes resources, slower response, can't scale
**Instead**: Use webhooks with proper verification

### Anti-Pattern: No Rate Limiting
**What it looks like**: Sending API requests without throttling
**Why wrong**: Gets bot banned, triggers 429s, poor UX
**Instead**: Implement adaptive rate limiter respecting API headers

### Anti-Pattern: In-Memory State Only
**What it looks like**: Storing conversation state in Python dict
**Why wrong**: Lost on restart, can't scale to multiple instances
**Instead**: Redis for state, PostgreSQL for persistence

### Anti-Pattern: Blocking Event Handlers
**What it looks like**: Long-running operations in `on_message`
**Why wrong**: Blocks all other events, causes timeouts
**Instead**: Async tasks, message queue for heavy work

## Security Checklist

```
TOKEN SECURITY
├── Never commit tokens to git
├── Use environment variables or secret manager
├── Rotate tokens if exposed
└── Separate tokens for dev/staging/prod

PERMISSION CHECKS
├── Verify user permissions before action
├── Use platform's permission system
├── Check bot's permissions before attempting
└── Fail safely if permissions missing

INPUT VALIDATION
├── Sanitize all user input
├── Validate command arguments
├── Parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
└── Rate limit user-triggered actions
```

**Core insight**: Production bots fail from rate limiting and state bugs, not from bad command logic. Build infrastructure first.
