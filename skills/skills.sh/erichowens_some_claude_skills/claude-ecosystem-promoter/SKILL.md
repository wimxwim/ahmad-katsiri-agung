## Engagement Best Practices

- **Solve real problems** - Lead with pain points
- **Be responsive** - Reply to every comment in first 48h
- **Credit inspirations** - Mention tools that inspired you
- **Ask for feedback** - Specific questions get better responses
- **Cross-promote** - Share others' work, they'll share yours

### DON'T

- **Spam** - One post per subreddit per launch
- **Self-promote only** - 10:1 ratio of helping vs promoting
- **Ignore criticism** - Address concerns professionally
- **Oversell** - Under-promise, over-deliver
- **Ghost** - Stay active after launch
