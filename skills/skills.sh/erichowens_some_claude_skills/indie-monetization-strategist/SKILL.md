# Indie Monetization Strategist

Turn side projects into sustainable income. Battle-tested strategies for indie developers and solopreneurs.

## Quick Start

1. **Build audience first** - Email list is your foundation
2. **Start with validation** - If people won't use it free, they won't pay
3. **Stack revenue streams** - Multiple small wins beats one moonshot
4. **Price on value, not cost** - Premium pricing attracts premium customers
5. **Play the long game** - Most "overnight" successes took 3-5 years

## When to Use

**Use for:**
- Choosing monetization models for dev tools
- Setting up freemium/premium tiers
- Pricing strategy decisions
- Email list building for launches
- Sponsorship and donation systems

**NOT for:**
- Enterprise B2B sales (use sales skills)
- VC fundraising/pitch decks
- Large-scale advertising campaigns

```

## Model Quick Reference

### Freemium SaaS (80/20 Rule)

| Tier | Price | What to Include |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Core functionality, usage limits, goal: get users hooked |
| **Pro** | $9-29/mo | Higher limits, no branding, priority support |
| **Team** | $49-199/mo | Admin controls, SSO, SLA guarantees |

**Gate these:** Usage volume, team features, white-labeling, advanced analytics
**Never gate:** Core functionality, security features, basics competitors offer free

### Sponsorship Pricing Formula

```
Monthly visitors × $0.01-0.05 = Base sponsorship rate

Multipliers:
+ Developer audience (2-3x)
+ Niche focus (1.5-2x)
+ High engagement (1.5x)
```

### Donation Platforms

| Platform | Best For | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| GitHub Sponsors | Developers | Best for OSS |
| Buy Me a Coffee | Low friction | Quick setup |
| Ko-fi | Creators | No platform cut |
| Stripe Links | Direct | Lowest fees |

## Pricing Psychology Essentials

**The Decoy Effect:**
```
BASIC: $9    PRO: $29 (target)    ENTERPRISE: $99 (decoy)
```

**Price Anchoring:**
```
❌ "Only $29/month!"
✅ "$49/month → $29/month (save 40%)"
```

**Annual vs Monthly:**
```
Monthly: $29/month | Annual: $19/month (billed $228/year)
Annual subscribers have 5x lower churn.
```

## Anti-Patterns (10 Critical Mistakes)

### 1. Premature Monetization
**Symptom:** Adding payments before product-market fit
**Fix:** Validate with free users first

### 2. Race to the Bottom Pricing
**Symptom:** Pricing way below competitors
**Fix:** Price on value delivered, not competitor copying

### 3. Feature Bloat to Justify Price
**Symptom:** Adding features nobody asked for
**Fix:** Charge more for LESS but BETTER

### 4. Ignoring Existing Monetization
**Symptom:** Building new revenue streams instead of optimizing existing
**Fix:** 2x conversion rate before adding new streams

### 5. Crippled Free Tier
**Symptom:** Free tier so limited it's useless
**Fix:** Users who never experience value never convert

### 6. No Email List
**Symptom:** Relying only on organic traffic
**Fix:** Build list before you need it - foundation for everything

### 7. One-Size-Fits-All Pricing
**Symptom:** Same price for hobbyists and enterprises
**Fix:** Segment pricing by use case and value

### 8. Hidden Costs
**Symptom:** Surprise fees after signup
**Fix:** Transparent pricing builds trust

### 9. Ignoring Churn
**Symptom:** Focus on acquisition, not retention
**Fix:** Reducing churn 5% can increase profits 25-95%

### 10. Pricing Too Low
**Symptom:** Undervaluing your work
**Fix:** Higher prices = better customers, higher expectations

## Revenue Benchmarks (Indie Scale)

| Stage | Monthly Revenue | Meaning |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Ramen Profitable | $2-5k | Can quit day job (barely) |
| Comfortable | $10-20k | Good indie income |
| Scaling | $50k+ | Time to consider hiring |

**Reality check:** Most indie projects earn $0-500/month. $2k/month = top 10%.

## Quick Implementation

### Add Payments (5 min with Stripe)

```typescript
// See references/stripe-integration.md for complete guide
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  line_items: [{ price: 'price_xxx', quantity: 1 }],
  success_url: 'https://yoursite.com/success',
});
```

### Add Sponsorship Button

```html
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/yourusername">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-💖-ea4aaa">
</a>
```

### Launch Email Sequence

```
Day 0: Deliver lead magnet + welcome
Day 3: Best content piece
Day 7: Your story/why you built this
Day 14: Soft pitch
Day 21: Social proof
Day 30: Direct pitch with deadline
```
