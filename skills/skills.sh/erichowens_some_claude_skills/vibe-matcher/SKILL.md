# Vibe Matcher

A synesthete designer who translates abstract feelings and brand vibes into concrete visual language - the bridge between "I want it to feel edgy" and "Use #FF006E with 800-weight Montserrat".

## Quick Start

**Minimal example to translate vibe into visual specs:**

```
User: "Make my portfolio feel edgy but still professional"

Vibe Matcher:
1. Clarify domain: "Professional software engineer portfolio"
2. Confirm audience: "Technical hiring managers and recruiters"
3. Translate "edgy + professional":
   - Colors: Dark charcoal (#1a1a1a) + hot pink accent (#ff3366) + white
   - Typography: Inter Black (800 weight) for headings, Inter (400) for body
   - Layout: Asymmetric grid with unexpected element placement
   - Interactions: Quick animations (150ms), sharp hover effects
4. Provide rationale for each choice
```

**Key principle**: Same vibe word means different things in different domains. Always clarify context before translating.

## Core Mission

Transform vague emotional requests into actionable design specifications by understanding how visual elements evoke psychological responses across different domains and audiences.

## When to Use

✅ Use when:
- User describes desired feeling ("trustworthy", "playful", "premium")
- User provides mood words without visual direction
- Translating brand personality into design decisions
- Adapting same vibe across different mediums (web, print, VR)
- User says "make it feel more [adjective]"

❌ Do NOT use when:
- User already has specific design specs (colors, fonts, layouts)
- Request is about functionality, not aesthetics
- User needs code implementation (this provides specs, not code)
- Request is for single element tweak (just make the change)

## Vibe Translation Process

### 1. Vibe Intake

Extract key emotional descriptors from user:
- Primary vibe (main feeling to evoke)
- Secondary vibes (supporting emotions)
- Domain context (portfolio, e-commerce, SaaS, etc.)
- Target audience (technical, general, enterprise, creative)
- Constraints (brand colors, accessibility needs, technical limits)

### 2. Domain-Aware Translation

The same vibe word translates differently across domains:

#### "Edgy" Translations

| Domain | Colors | Typography | Layout | Interactions |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Professional Portfolio | Dark bg (#1a1a1a), bold accents (#ff3366) | Heavy sans-serif (800+ weight) | Asymmetric, unexpected | Sharp, quick animations |
| SaaS Product | High contrast, neon accents | Angular geometric fonts | Grid-chaos (broken grid) | Glitch effects, distortion |
| E-commerce | Black/red, metallic accents | All-caps, tight tracking | Diagonal layouts | Aggressive hover effects |

#### "Trustworthy" Translations

| Domain | Colors | Typography | Layout | Interactions |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Financial Services | Navy blues, conservative grays | Serif for body, clean sans headers | Traditional grid, generous spacing | Smooth, predictable |
| Healthcare | Soft blues, whites, accent greens | Readable serif, professional | Clear hierarchy, whitespace | Gentle, reassuring |
| Legal Services | Deep blues, burgundy accents | Traditional serif (Garamond-style) | Formal layouts, centered | Minimal, dignified |

#### "Premium" Translations

| Domain | Colors | Typography | Layout | Interactions |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Luxury Goods | Black/white/gold, minimal palette | Elegant serif + thin sans | Generous whitespace, elegant | Slow, luxurious |
| Tech Products | Deep blacks, metallic accents | Modern geometric sans | Sleek, minimal | Smooth, polished |
| Creative Services | Monochrome + single bold accent | Mix of elegant serif + modern sans | Sophisticated asymmetry | Subtle, refined |

### 3. Visual DNA Assembly

Generate complete visual specification:

```typescript
interface VisualDNA {
  colors: {
    primary: string; // Dominant color, hex code
    secondary: string; // Supporting color
    accent: string; // Highlight color
    neutrals: string[]; // Grays/backgrounds
    rationale: string; // Why these colors evoke the vibe
  };

  typography: {
    headings: {
      family: string;
      weight: number;
      characteristics: string; // "Bold, geometric, attention-grabbing"
    };
    body: {
      family: string;
      weight: number;
      size: string; // "16-18px for readability"
    };
    rationale: string; // How fonts convey the vibe
  };

  layout: {
    system: string; // "12-column grid" | "freeform" | "asymmetric"
    spacing: string; // "tight" | "balanced" | "generous"
    hierarchy: string; // How elements are prioritized
    rationale: string; // Layout psychology
  };

  interactions: {
    speed: string; // "instant" | "snappy" | "smooth" | "luxurious"
    patterns: string[]; // ["hover-lift", "fade-in", "parallax"]
    rationale: string; // Interaction personality
  };

  moodBoard: {
    references: string[]; // URLs to inspirational examples
    takeaways: string[]; // What to learn from each reference
  };
}
```

### 4. Medium Adaptations

Same vibe may translate differently across mediums:

**Web → Mobile**
- Touch targets vs hover states
- Thumb-friendly layouts
- Reduced motion for battery

**Web → Print**
- CMYK vs RGB color adjustment
- Resolution and bleed considerations
- Static hierarchy without interaction

**Web → VR**
- Spatial depth and 3D typography
- Gaze-based interaction patterns
- Comfort and accessibility in 3D space

## Vibe Vocabulary

### Emotional Clusters

**Energy Level**:
- Low: Calm, serene, meditative, gentle
- Medium: Balanced, professional, approachable, friendly
- High: Energetic, exciting, bold, intense

**Formality Level**:
- Casual: Playful, fun, quirky, irreverent
- Professional: Clean, competent, reliable, modern
- Formal: Traditional, established, authoritative, prestigious

**Innovation Level**:
- Conservative: Safe, familiar, trusted, timeless
- Modern: Current, fresh, contemporary, relevant
- Cutting-Edge: Experimental, innovative, bold, future-forward

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Generic Vibe Interpretation
**What it looks like**: "Premium" always means black/white/gold
**Why it's wrong**: Premium means different things in tech vs fashion vs food
**What to do instead**: Always ask domain context before translating vibe

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring Target Audience
**What it looks like**: Using same "playful" for children's app and professional tool
**Why it's wrong**: Same vibe word has different implementations for different audiences
**What to do instead**: Clarify audience sophistication, expectations, and context

### Anti-Pattern: Style Over Function
**What it looks like**: "Edgy" design that's impossible to read
**Why it's wrong**: Vibe should enhance, not compromise, usability
**What to do instead**: Balance emotional impact with accessibility and clarity

### Anti-Pattern: Temporal Ignorance
**What it looks like**: Using 2019 "minimal" trends for 2025 project
**Why it's wrong**: Visual language evolves; yesterday's "modern" is today's "dated"
**What to do instead**: Know current design trends for each vibe category

## When NOT to Use

This skill is NOT appropriate for:
- Users with complete design specs already (just implement them)
- Functionality questions ("how do I center a div?")
- Code implementation (this provides design direction, not code)
- Brand strategy or messaging (this is visual translation only)
- Single element tweaks ("make this button blue")

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User gives conflicting vibes
**Example**: "Make it premium but also playful and aggressive"
**Fix**: Identify primary vibe, explain tensions, suggest dominant + accent approach ("Premium primary with playful accent moments")

### Issue: Vibe doesn't match domain conventions
**Example**: "Make this bank website feel edgy and experimental"
**Fix**: Surface the conflict, explain risks, offer balanced alternatives ("Modern and confident without sacrificing trust signals")

### Issue: Vibe is too generic
**Example**: "Make it look good"
**Fix**: Probe with specific questions: "When you close your eyes and imagine the perfect version, what feeling does it give you?"

### Issue: Can't translate vibe to concrete specs
**Example**: User says "make it feel ethereal"
**Fix**: Find reference points: "Like Apple's aesthetic? Or more like a watercolor painting? Help me understand your 'ethereal'"

## Integration with Other Skills

### Recommended Workflow: Vibe → Tokens → Implementation

```
1. vibe-matcher     → Clarify emotional direction, get Visual DNA specs
2. design-system-generator → Generate production token files (Tailwind, CSS vars, DTCG)
3. web-design-expert       → Implement the design system in actual components
```

Works well with:
- **design-system-generator**: After vibe-matcher outputs Visual DNA, use design-system-generator to create production-ready token files (Tailwind config, CSS custom properties, DTCG JSON). This turns conceptual specs into actual code.
- **Web Design Expert**: Vibe-matcher provides emotional direction, web-design-expert implements
- **Typography Expert**: Vibe informs font selection, typography-expert provides pairing details
- **Design Archivist**: Use pattern database to find examples matching desired vibe

## Best Practices

### Start Broad, Get Specific
1. Capture all vibe words user mentions
2. Identify primary emotional goal
3. Drill into domain-specific translation
4. Generate concrete specifications
5. Provide rationale for each choice

### Validate Understanding
Before generating specs, confirm:
- "When you say 'edgy', do you mean dangerous/exciting or just not boring?"
- "Is this 'premium' like luxury goods or like Apple products?"
- "Should 'playful' be whimsical or just friendly?"

### Explain the Psychology
Don't just prescribe colors - explain why:
- "Navy blue signals trust because it's associated with uniforms (police, pilots, doctors)"
- "Heavy font weights feel assertive and confident, matching your 'bold' requirement"
- "Generous whitespace creates breathing room, supporting your 'calm' vibe"

## Example Vibe Translations

### Example 1: "Edgy Professional Portfolio"
**Input**: Software engineer wants "edgy but still hireable"
**Translation**:
- Colors: Dark charcoal (#1a1a1a) + hot pink accent (#ff3366) + white
- Typography: Heavy sans-serif headings (Inter Black, 800 weight) + clean body (Inter, 400)
- Layout: Asymmetric grid, unexpected element placement, strong diagonal lines
- Interactions: Quick, sharp animations (150ms), bold hover effects
- Rationale: Dark + neon signals technical/modern, heavy fonts show confidence, asymmetry creates visual interest without chaos, fast animations feel responsive and sharp

### Example 2: "Premium Wellness Brand"
**Input**: Meditation app wants "premium but not cold"
**Translation**:
- Colors: Warm off-white (#faf9f7) + sage green (#8b9d83) + terracotta accent (#c97d60)
- Typography: Elegant serif headings (Cormorant, 500) + readable sans body (Nunito, 400)
- Layout: Generous whitespace, centered content, gentle curves
- Interactions: Slow, smooth transitions (400-600ms), fade-ins, gentle parallax
- Rationale: Warm neutrals feel expensive but welcoming, serif adds sophistication without coldness, generous spacing creates calm, slow animations encourage mindfulness

### Example 3: "Playful SaaS Dashboard"
**Input**: Project management tool wants "fun but not unprofessional"
**Translation**:
- Colors: Bright blue (#0066ff) + yellow accent (#ffd60a) + clean white
- Typography: Rounded sans-serif (Poppins, 600 headings / 400 body)
- Layout: Clean grid with occasional playful element breaks
- Interactions: Bouncy micro-animations, celebratory confetti on completions
- Rationale: Primary colors evoke energy without childishness, rounded fonts feel friendly, clean grid maintains professionalism, selective playfulness in rewards keeps it professional

## Evolution Timeline

### 2010-2015: Flat Design Era
"Minimal" meant flat colors, no shadows, simple geometric shapes

### 2016-2020: Material Design & Shadows
"Modern" added subtle depth, card-based layouts, gentle shadows

### 2021-2023: Neumorphism & Glassmorphism
"Premium" explored soft shadows (neumorphism) and frosted glass effects

### 2024-Present: Bold Typography & Asymmetry
"Edgy" emphasizes large type, broken grids, unexpected layouts

### Watch For
LLMs trained on older data may suggest dated interpretations of vibes
