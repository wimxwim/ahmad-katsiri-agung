description: Tracks cumulative LLM costs across DAG execution and makes real-time decisions to stay within budget. Downgrades models, skips optional nodes, or stops early when cost exceeds thresholds. Use
  when managing execution budgets, analyzing cost breakdowns, or optimizing model routing for cost. Activate on "cost budget", "too expensive", "reduce cost", "cost optimization", "model downgrade", "budget
  exceeded". NOT for LLM model selection logic (use llm-router), pricing comparisons across providers, or billing/invoicing.

# Cost Optimizer

Tracks cumulative LLM costs across DAG execution and makes real-time decisions to stay within budget: downgrade models, skip optional nodes, or stop early.

---

## When to Use

✅ **Use for**:
- Setting and enforcing cost budgets for DAG executions
- Real-time cost monitoring during execution
- Deciding when to downgrade model tiers mid-execution
- Identifying which nodes are most expensive and why
- Post-execution cost analysis and optimization recommendations

❌ **NOT for**:
- Choosing which model to use per node (use `llm-router`)
- Provider pricing comparisons (static data, not a skill)
- Billing or invoicing features

## Budget Enforcement Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  N[Node about to execute] --> C[Check: spent + estimated_node_cost vs budget]
  C --> S{Within budget?}
  S -->|Yes, &gt;20% remaining| E[Execute at planned model tier]
  S -->|Yes, &lt;20% remaining| W[Execute but downgrade to Tier 1 if possible]
  S -->|No| D{Node optional?}
  D -->|Yes| SK[Skip node]
  D -->|No| H{Human gate available?}
  H -->|Yes| A[Ask human: continue over budget?]
  H -->|No| ST[Stop execution, return partial results]
```

### Budget Tiers

| Budget Remaining | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| &gt;50% | Execute at planned model tier |
| 20-50% | Log warning. Continue at planned tier. |
| 10-20% | Downgrade remaining Tier 2 nodes to Tier 1 (Haiku) |
| 5-10% | Downgrade ALL remaining nodes to Tier 1. Skip optional nodes. |
| &lt;5% | Stop execution unless next node is critical path |
| 0% | Stop. Return partial results with cost breakdown. |

### Cost Estimation Per Node

Before each node executes, estimate its cost:
```
estimated_cost = (avg_input_tokens × input_price + avg_output_tokens × output_price)
```

Use historical averages for this skill + model combination. If no history, use defaults:
- Tier 1 (Haiku): ~800 input + 400 output = ~$0.001
- Tier 2 (Sonnet): ~2000 input + 1000 output = ~$0.012
- Tier 3 (Opus): ~3000 input + 1500 output = ~$0.16

### Post-Execution Report

```yaml
cost_report:
  total_budget: 0.50
  total_spent: 0.37
  budget_remaining: 0.13
  nodes_executed: 8
  nodes_skipped: 1
  nodes_downgraded: 2
  model_breakdown:
    haiku: { calls: 4, cost: 0.004 }
    sonnet: { calls: 3, cost: 0.036 }
    opus: { calls: 1, cost: 0.33 }
  savings_recommendations:
    - "Node 'deep-analysis' used Opus ($0.33) but downstream accepted on first try. Try Sonnet next time — potential saving: $0.32"
    - "Nodes 'validate-a' and 'validate-b' are sequential but independent. Parallelize to reduce wall-clock time."
```

## Anti-Patterns

### No Budget at All
**Wrong**: Running DAGs without any cost tracking until the API bill arrives.
**Right**: Every DAG execution has a budget, even if generous. Track spend per node.

### Aggressive Downgrading
**Wrong**: Downgrading Opus nodes to Haiku at 50% budget remaining, causing quality failures that trigger expensive retries.
**Right**: Only downgrade when the alternative is stopping execution. Retries cost more than the original model tier.

### Ignoring Retries in Cost
**Wrong**: Budgeting for one attempt per node.
**Right**: Budget for avg_retries × cost_per_attempt. A node with 3 retries on Sonnet costs $0.036, not $0.012.
