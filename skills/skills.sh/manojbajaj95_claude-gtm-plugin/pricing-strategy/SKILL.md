# Pricing Strategy

## Workspace Context

Read bootstrap context before asking questions: `strategy/brand.md` for brand, audience, offer, channels, tools, constraints, and metrics; `about/me.md` for personal voice; `content/ideas.md` and `content/calendar.md` for content planning. Use legacy product-marketing context files only as fallback. Save generated drafts to `content/<platform>/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD_short-topic-slug.md`, and route durable learnings back to `strategy/brand.md`, `about/me.md`, or `content/ideas.md`.

## Operating Contract

This skill is self-contained for its frontmatter scope: use its local instructions, references, scripts, and assets as the playbook; ask only for missing task-specific inputs; hand off to adjacent skills instead of expanding scope; and return an actionable artifact, decision, plan, draft, or diagnostic.



Expert guidance on SaaS pricing, value metrics, tier structure, pricing research, and monetization.

## Before Starting

Gather: product type, target market (SMB/mid-market/enterprise), GTM motion (self-serve/sales-led/hybrid), primary value delivered, competitive pricing, current conversion rate and ARPU, pricing goals (growth vs. revenue vs. profitability).

## Pricing Fundamentals

**Three axes**: Packaging (what's in each tier) + Value metric (what you charge for) + Price point (the amount).

**Core principle**: 1% improvement in pricing = 11% improvement in profit (McKinsey). Price to value, not cost.

**Value-based pricing**: Price between the next best alternative and perceived value. Cost is a floor, not a basis.

```
Perceived value of your solution: $1,000
Your price:                        $500  ← capture value here
Next best alternative:             $300  ← your floor
Your cost to serve:                 $50
```

**Value calculation template**:
```
Time savings: [hours/week × hourly rate × 52]
Revenue impact: [additional deals × deal value × 12]
Cost avoidance: [errors prevented × cost per error × 12]
Total annual value: $____

Suggested price: $[10% of value] – $[20% of value] / year
```

## Pricing Models

| Model | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| **Flat Rate** ($99/mo, unlimited) | Simple to sell | Leaves money on table |
| **Tiered** (Starter/Pro/Business) | Captures segments, clear upsell | Anchor pricing matters |
| **Usage-Based** ($0.01/call) | Perfect value alignment, low barrier | Unpredictable revenue |
| **Hybrid** ($49/mo + $0.50/extra user) | Predictable base + scales | More complex to explain |

---

## Value Metrics

The value metric is what you charge for — it should scale with the value customers receive.

| Metric | Best For | Examples |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Per user/seat | Collaboration tools | Slack, Notion |
| Per usage/consumption | Variable workloads | AWS, Twilio |
| Per contact/record | CRM, email tools | Mailchimp, HubSpot |
| Per transaction | Payments, marketplaces | Stripe, Shopify |
| Flat fee | Simple, bounded products | Basecamp |
| Revenue share | High-value outcome tools | Affiliate platforms |

**Choosing your metric**: Analyze which usage patterns predict retention and expansion in your highest-LTV customers. If "more of X = more value," X is your metric.

## Pricing Research Methods

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

Ask 100–300 respondents four questions:
1. Too expensive — would not buy
2. Too cheap — would question quality
3. Expensive but would consider
4. Bargain / great value

**Key intersections**:
- PMC (Point of Marginal Cheapness): "Too cheap" × "Expensive" → lower bound
- PME (Point of Marginal Expensiveness): "Too expensive" × "Cheap" → upper bound
- OPP (Optimal Price Point): "Too cheap" × "Too expensive" → best price
- IDP (Indifference Price Point): "Expensive" × "Cheap" → acceptable midpoint

**Acceptable range**: PMC → PME. **Optimal zone**: OPP → IDP.

### MaxDiff / Feature Importance

Show sets of 4–5 features; ask "most important" and "least important." Results rank features by utility score:

| Utility | Packaging Decision |
|---------|-------------------|
| Top 20% | Include in all tiers (table stakes) |
| 20–50% | Use to differentiate tiers |
| 50–80% | Higher tiers only |
| Bottom 20% | Cut or premium add-on |

### Willingness to Pay

- **Gabor-Granger**: Show price → "Would you buy at $X?" (Yes/No). Vary price across respondents to build demand curve.
- **Conjoint analysis**: Show bundles at different prices; respondents choose preferred option.

---

## Tier Structure

**The Rule of 3**: Starter (50–60% of customers) → Pro/sweet spot (30–40%) → Business/Enterprise (5–10%).

**Anchor pricing**: Middle tier 3–4× starter price; top tier 2–3× middle. This makes the middle tier the obvious choice.

```
Starter:  $29/mo  — core features, 5 users, email support
Pro:      $99/mo  — everything + integrations, 20 users, priority support  ← Most Popular
Business: $299/mo — everything + SSO, unlimited users, dedicated support
```

### Good-Better-Best Framework

| Tier | Purpose | Price | Target |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Good** (Starter) | Remove barriers to entry | Low, accessible | Small teams, trial converts |
| **Better** (Pro) | Where most customers land | Anchor price | Growing teams |
| **Best** (Business) | Capture high-value customers | 2–3× Better | Larger teams, power users |

### Feature Gating

**What to gate:**
- Scale limits: users, projects, API calls, storage
- Sophistication: advanced analytics, automations, integrations
- Control: SSO/SAML, admin roles, audit logs, custom branding

**Never gate**: core functionality, security features, data export.

## Freemium vs. Free Trial

| | Freemium | Free Trial |
|-|----------|-----------|
| **Best for** | PLG, wide top of funnel | Sales-led, high-ACV |
| **Conversion** | 2–5% free → paid | 15–25% trial → paid |
| **Risk** | Free riders, support cost | Shorter window to prove value |
| **Use when** | Network effects, viral growth | Complex product needing onboarding |

---

## Pricing Psychology

- **Anchor effect**: Show highest tier first to anchor perception
- **Charm pricing**: $49 vs. $50 (perceived as significantly cheaper)
- **Decoy pricing**: Add a "bad" middle option to push customers to "best"
- **Annual vs. monthly**: Offer 15–20% discount for annual (improves LTV and reduces churn). Offer at signup, after 2–3 months, and during renewal
- **Per user transparency**: Show total cost at common team sizes (e.g., "5 users = $X/mo")

---

## Pricing Experiments

**What to A/B test**: Price points, tier packaging, billing frequency, free trial length, anchor tier.

**Sample sizes**: ~1,000 visitors/variant to detect 10% change; ~5,000 for 5% change.

**Metrics to track**: Conversion (trial → paid), ARPU, CAC, LTV, payback period.

**Price increases**: Raise every 12–18 months as you add value. Communicate 30+ days in advance. Grandfather existing customers for 12 months or offer annual lock-in at current price.

---

## Revenue Expansion

**Upsell triggers**:
- User hits usage limit → show upgrade prompt immediately
- User clicks locked feature → show upgrade at moment of value
- User active 30+ days on starter → "power user" upgrade nudge

**Add-ons** (use when a feature has standalone value not everyone needs):
```
Base plan: $99/mo
+ Extra users: $10/user/mo
+ Advanced analytics: $49/mo
+ White label: $99/mo
+ Priority support: $199/mo
```

---

## Pricing by Segment

| Segment | Price Point | Sales Motion | Decision Maker | Sales Cycle |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| SMB | $29–99/mo | Self-serve | End user/team lead | Minutes–days |
| Mid-Market | $99–999/mo | Self-serve + light touch | Dept head | Days–weeks |
| Enterprise | $1,000+/mo | High-touch sales | VP/C-level | Weeks–months |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|------------------|
| Trial → Paid conversion | >15% |
| MRR Growth (early stage) | >10%/month |
| Churn Rate | <5%/mo (SMB), <1%/mo (enterprise) |
| LTV:CAC | >3:1 |
| Payback Period | <12 months |
| Net Revenue Retention | >100% |

---

## Discount Framework

| Type | Trigger | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| Volume | Commitment to scale | 10–30% |
| Term | Annual commitment | 15–25% (2 months free) |
| Competitive | Switching from competitor | 20–40% |
| Strategic | Reference customer / logo value | Up to 50% |

**Never discount when**: customer hasn't articulated value, no competitive pressure, early in negotiation, or deal doesn't meet minimum size.

**Alternatives to discounting**: extended payment terms, additional services/training, extended trial, success milestone unlocks, multi-year lock-in.

---

## Common Pricing Mistakes

- Pricing on cost, not value
- Too many tiers (analysis paralysis — stick to 3)
- Feature gates customers don't care about
- Gating core functionality (lock what makes your product worth using)
- Complex value metric (users shouldn't need a calculator for their bill)
- Ignoring price sensitivity by segment
- Never testing or iterating on pricing
- Burying the price page (hiding = distrust)

---

## Price Increase Playbook

1. **Quantify value** delivered since last price (new features, outcomes, benchmarks)
2. **Grandfather existing customers** for 3–6 months (or 12 months for best customers)
3. **Communicate early** (60-day notice minimum)
4. **Frame as investment** not cost increase — tie to ROI
5. **Offer annual lock-in** before increase date to capture cash
6. **Monitor churn** closely for 90 days post-increase

---

## Checklists

**Launching pricing**:
- [ ] Pick value metric; design 3 tiers with anchor prices (3–4× between tiers)
- [ ] Package features (60% / 85% / 100%); offer 14-day trial; set up billing

**Optimizing pricing**:
- [ ] Track conversion rates by tier; survey customers on pricing perception
- [ ] A/B test price points; add annual billing option; create in-app upgrade prompts
- [ ] Monitor NRR; review pricing every 6–12 months
