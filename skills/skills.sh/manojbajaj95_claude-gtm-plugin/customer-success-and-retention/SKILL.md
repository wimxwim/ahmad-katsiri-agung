# Customer Success & Retention

## Workspace Context

Read bootstrap context before asking questions: `strategy/brand.md` for brand, audience, offer, channels, tools, constraints, and metrics; `about/me.md` for personal voice; `content/ideas.md` and `content/calendar.md` for content planning. Use legacy product-marketing context files only as fallback. Save generated drafts to `content/<platform>/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD_short-topic-slug.md`, and route durable learnings back to `strategy/brand.md`, `about/me.md`, or `content/ideas.md`.

## Operating Contract

This skill is self-contained for its frontmatter scope: use its local instructions, references, scripts, and assets as the playbook; ask only for missing task-specific inputs; hand off to adjacent skills instead of expanding scope; and return an actionable artifact, decision, plan, draft, or diagnostic.



Comprehensive framework for customer success, retention, and lifetime value maximization.

## Part 1: Core Principles

### Time to Value Is Everything

The faster users get value, the more likely they stick. Measure and optimize time to first value moment. Remove every obstacle between signup and aha moment.

### Proactive Beats Reactive

Reach out before problems escalate. Health scores predict churn before it happens. Intervention when metrics dip is worth 10x intervention after cancellation request.

### Segment for Relevance

Not all customers are the same. High-touch for enterprise, tech-touch for SMB, self-serve for individuals. Match effort to customer value and needs.

### Measure Leading Indicators

Revenue is a lagging indicator. Track: engagement, feature adoption, support tickets, NPS changes.

### Make Expansion Natural

Upselling should feel like helping, not selling. When customers outgrow their tier, expansion is a solution.

## Part 2: Customer Onboarding Design

### Onboarding Workflow

1. Map customer goals and success criteria
2. Define key milestones and timeline
3. Create onboarding checklist
4. Design enablement content
5. Set up automated touchpoints
6. Define handoff from sales
7. Measure time-to-value

### Activation Milestones

| Milestone | Target Time | D30 Retention Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Account created | T+0 | Baseline |
| Profile complete | T+5 min | +8% |
| First core action | T+24 hr | +15% |
| First value experience | T+3 days | +25% |
| 3-day active streak | T+7 days | +35% |

### Onboarding Patterns

| Approach | Best For | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Product-first | Simple products, B2C | Blank slate overwhelm |
| Guided setup | Products needing personalization | Friction before value |
| Value-first | Products with demo data | May not feel "real" |

---

## Part 3: Health Scoring

### Customer Health Score (100 points)

| Dimension | Weight | Signals |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Usage frequency | 25% | DAU/MAU ratio, sessions, last login |
| Feature depth | 20% | Feature adoption %, core feature use |
| Engagement | 20% | Time on app, actions per session |
| Satisfaction | 15% | NPS, CSAT, support sentiment |
| Growth | 10% | Seat additions, plan upgrades |
| Relationship | 10% | Community participation, referrals |

### Health Score Thresholds

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80-100 | Healthy | Upsell opportunities |
| 60-79 | Stable | Monitor |
| 40-59 | At Risk | Automated intervention |
| 0-39 | Critical | Human outreach |

### Churn Risk Scoring

| Level | Score | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Low | 0-29 | Continue normal engagement |
| Medium | 30-49 | Automated re-engagement |
| High | 50-69 | Personalized intervention |
| Critical | 70+ | Human outreach (call/email) |

---

## Part 4: Churn Prevention

### Churn Types & Solutions

| Type | Cause | Solution |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Voluntary** | Customer chooses to cancel | Cancel flows, save offers, exit surveys |
| **Involuntary** | Payment fails | Dunning emails, smart retries, card updaters |

Voluntary churn is typically 50-70% of total. Involuntary is 30-50% but easier to fix.

### Risk Signals

| Signal | Risk Level | Timeframe |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Login frequency drops 50%+ | High | 2-4 weeks before cancel |
| Key feature usage stops | High | 1-3 weeks before cancel |
| Support tickets spike then stop | High | 1-2 weeks before cancel |
| Billing page visits increase | High | Days before cancel |
| Team seats removed | High | 1-2 weeks before cancel |
| Data export initiated | Critical | Days before cancel |
| NPS score drops below 6 | Medium | 1-3 months before cancel |

### Proactive Interventions

| Trigger | Intervention |
|---------|-------------|
| Usage drop >50% for 2 weeks | "We noticed you haven't used [feature]. Need help?" email |
| Approaching plan limit | Upgrade nudge |
| No login for 14 days | Re-engagement email with product updates |
| NPS detractor (0-6) | Personal follow-up within 24 hours |

---

## Part 5: Cancel Flow Design

### The Cancel Flow Structure

```
Trigger → Survey → Dynamic Offer → Confirmation → Post-Cancel
```

### Exit Survey Design

| Reason | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Too expensive | Price sensitivity, may respond to discount |
| Not using it enough | Low engagement, may respond to pause/onboarding |
| Missing a feature | Product gap, show roadmap |
| Switching to competitor | Competitive pressure |
| Technical issues | Product quality, escalate to support |
| Temporary / seasonal | Usage pattern, offer pause |

### Save Offer Mapping

| Cancel Reason | Primary Offer | Fallback Offer |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Too expensive | Discount (20-30% for 2-3 months) | Downgrade |
| Not using | Pause (1-3 months) | Free onboarding |
| Missing feature | Roadmap preview | Workaround guide |
| Competitor | Competitive comparison + discount | Feedback session |
| Technical issues | Escalate to support | Credit + priority fix |

### Save Offer Types

- **Discount**: 20-30% for 2-3 months (avoid 50%+)
- **Pause**: 1-3 months max, 60-80% eventually return
- **Downgrade**: Show what they keep vs. lose
- **Feature unlock**: Extend trial of higher tier
- **Personal outreach**: For high-value accounts

---

## Part 6: Involuntary Churn (Dunning)

### The Dunning Stack

```
Pre-dunning → Smart retry → Dunning emails → Grace period → Hard cancel
```

### Pre-Dunning (Prevent Failures)

- Card expiry alerts: 30, 15, 7 days before
- Backup payment method prompt at signup
- Card updater services (Visa/MC auto-update)
- Pre-billing notification for annual plans

### Smart Retry Logic

| Decline Type | Retry Strategy |
|-------------|----------------|
| Soft decline | Retry 3-5 times over 7-10 days |
| Hard decline | Don't retry — ask for new card |
| Authentication required | Send customer to update payment |

### Dunning Email Sequence

| Email | Timing | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Day 0 | "Your payment didn't go through. Update your card." |
| 2 | Day 3 | "Quick reminder — update your payment." |
| 3 | Day 7 | "Your account will be paused in 3 days." |
| 4 | Day 10 | "Last chance to keep your account active." |

---

## Part 7: Re-engagement & Retention

### Re-engagement Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Channel | Max Frequency |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Early dormancy | 3-7 days inactive | Push | 4×/month |
| Mid dormancy | 7-14 days inactive | Email | 2×/month |
| Onboarding drop | Incomplete onboarding | Email | 3×/month |
| Feature discovery | Unused high-value feature | In-app | 1×/month |
| Streak at risk | Streak expires in 6 hours | Push | As needed |

### Habit Formation (Hook Model)

| Phase | Goal | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Trigger** | Create the cue | Push notifications, email digest |
| **Action** | Minimum viable behavior | One-click action, simple daily task |
| **Variable Reward** | Unpredictable value | Social recognition, progress unlocks |
| **Investment** | User commits something | Profile data, settings, connections |

### Gamification Elements

- **Badge rarity**: Common → Rare → Epic → Legendary
- **Progress levels**: 5 levels with XP ranges
- **Streak systems**: 7-day → 30-day → 100-day → 365-day

---

## Part 8: LTV Maximization

### The LTV Equation

```
LTV = (Average Revenue Per Customer × Average Customer Lifespan) - CAC
```

**To maximize LTV:**
- **INCREASE** Revenue Per Customer (upsells, cross-sells)
- **INCREASE** Customer Lifespan (reduce churn)
- **DECREASE** CAC (get referrals)

### Ascension Ladder

```
Level 1: Entry Offer → Solves first problem
    ↓
Level 2: Core Offer → Deeper solution
    ↓
Level 3: Premium Offer → Advanced/faster results
    ↓
Level 4: Done-For-You → They pay you to do it
    ↓
Level 5: Ongoing Relationship → Retainer/subscription
```

### Retention Levers

1. **Onboarding Excellence** — Get them a win in first 24-48 hours
2. **Engagement Systems** — Keep them using regularly
3. **Success Milestones** — Make progress visible and celebrated
4. **Community/Connection** — Create belonging
5. **Ascension Triggers** — Move to next level at right time

## Part 9: Metrics & Measurement

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Monthly churn rate | Churned / Start-of-month | <5% B2C, <2% B2B |
| Revenue churn (net) | (Lost MRR - Expansion) / Start MRR | Negative |
| Cancel flow save rate | Saved / Total cancel sessions | 25-35% |
| Dunning recovery rate | Recovered / Total failures | 50-60% |
| Time to cancel | Days from signal to cancel | Track trend |

### Cohort Analysis

Segment by:
- Acquisition channel
- Plan type
- Tenure
- Cancel reason
- Save offer type

## Part 10: Segmentation Strategy

### Customer Segment Approach

```
├── Enterprise (high-touch)
│   ├── Dedicated CSM
│   ├── Custom success plans
│   └── Executive sponsors
├── Mid-market (mid-touch)
│   ├── Pooled CSM model
│   ├── Templated playbooks
│   └── Regular check-ins
└── SMB (tech-touch)
    ├── Automated journeys
    ├── Self-service resources
    └── Trigger-based outreach
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **No cancel flow** — Even simple survey + offer saves 10-15%
2. **Same offer for every reason** — Match offer to reason
3. **Discounts too deep** — 50%+ trains customers to cancel-for-deals
4. **Ignoring involuntary churn** — Often 30-50% of total
5. **No dunning emails** — Letting payment failures silently cancel
6. **Guilt-trip copy** — Damages brand trust
7. **Pausing too long** — Beyond 3 months rarely reactivates
