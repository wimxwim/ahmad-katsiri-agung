  Analyze and optimize X (Twitter) posts for viral potential and reach using heuristics inspired by X's published open-source recommendation architecture.
  Use when user wants to: (1) Check if a post will go viral, (2) Score a tweet for engagement potential, (3) Optimize or rewrite a tweet for algorithmic reach, (4) Understand why a tweet underperformed, (5) Build audience in a specific niche.
  Triggers: "Check if this will go viral", "Make this post buzz", "Will this tweet perform well?", "Optimize my tweet", "How can I make this viral?", "rewrite this tweet", "improve my tweet engagement", "twitter algorithm", "tweet reach", "debug underperforming tweet",
  "バズるかチェックして", "Xでバズる投稿にして", "伸びるかチェックして", "この投稿を伸ばして", "投稿を改善して", "ツイートを最適化して"

# X Impact Checker

## Workspace Context

Read bootstrap context before asking questions: `strategy/brand.md` for brand, audience, offer, channels, tools, constraints, and metrics; `about/me.md` for personal voice; `content/ideas.md` and `content/calendar.md` for content planning. Use legacy product-marketing context files only as fallback. Save generated drafts to `content/<platform>/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD_short-topic-slug.md`, and route durable learnings back to `strategy/brand.md`, `about/me.md`, or `content/ideas.md`.

## Operating Contract

This skill is self-contained for its frontmatter scope: use its local instructions, references, scripts, and assets as the playbook; ask only for missing task-specific inputs; hand off to adjacent skills instead of expanding scope; and return an actionable artifact, decision, plan, draft, or diagnostic.



Analyze X posts for viral potential using a 19-element scoring system and heuristics inspired by X's published recommendation architecture.

## When to Use

- Score a tweet draft before publishing
- Understand why a tweet underperformed
- Rewrite tweets to align with Twitter's ranking mechanisms
- Build topical authority in a specific niche
- Debug inconsistent engagement rates

## Algorithm Architecture

Understanding the underlying models helps explain *why* the scoring works.

### Core Ranking Models

**Real-graph** — Predicts interaction likelihood between users
- Determines if your followers will engage with your content
- Strategy: Make content your specific follower segment will engage with

**SimClusters** — Community detection with sparse embeddings
- Identifies communities with similar interests; your tweet resonates within these clusters
- Strategy: Pick ONE clear topic and serve tight communities deeply

**TwHIN** — Knowledge graph embeddings mapping users and content topics
- Helps Twitter understand if your tweet fits your established identity
- Strategy: Stay in your niche or clearly signal topic shifts

**Tweepcred** — User reputation/authority scoring
- Your past engagement history affects current tweet reach
- Strategy: Build through consistent quality, not engagement bait

### Engagement Signals

**Explicit (high weight):** Likes, replies, retweets, quote tweets

**Implicit (also weighted):** Profile visits, link clicks, dwell time, saves/bookmarks

**Negative:** Block/report (heavily penalized), mute/unfollow, quick scroll-past

### Optimization by Algorithm Layer

| Layer | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| Real-graph | Ask questions; create debate; post when followers are active |
| SimClusters | One clear topic; use community language; provide niche value |
| TwHIN | Lead with domain expertise; stay consistent; build topical authority |
| Tweepcred | Reply to quality accounts; avoid engagement bait; engage deeply |

## Detailed Scoring Criteria

### Reply Potential (22 pts)
- Direct questions, debatable claims, opinion invitations
- ❌ "Just shipped a new feature." → ✅ "Should features ship fast but buggy, or slow but stable? We chose speed—was it the right call?"

### Retweet Potential (16 pts)
- Actionable insights, surprising facts, numbered lists, data-driven content
- ❌ "I learned something today." → ✅ "🧵 3 React patterns that cut my bundle size by 30%: 1. Lazy loading hooks 2. Code splitting by route 3. Tree-shaking unused exports"

### Favorite Potential (12 pts)
- Emotional resonance, personal stories, relatable moments, vulnerability
- ❌ "Debugging is hard." → ✅ "Spent 3 hours debugging a production issue. The fix? A missing semicolon I added during 'quick cleanup' at 2am. Never touching working code past midnight again 😅"

### Quote Potential (10 pts)
- Strong opinions, challenges conventional wisdom, clear stances
- ❌ "TypeScript is useful." → ✅ "TypeScript's biggest value isn't catching bugs—it's documentation. The type errors are just a bonus. Fight me."

### Dwell Time (6 pts)
- Long-form content requiring reading time; detailed explanations; technical depth

### Continuous Dwell Time (4 pts)
- Thread indicators (🧵, "1/"), narrative structure, complexity requiring re-reading
- ❌ "Here's how I built X." → ✅ "🧵 How I went from idea to $10k MRR in 30 days (1/8)\n\nDay 1-7: Validation..."

### Profile Click (5 pts)
- Creates author curiosity; demonstrates expertise; credibility signals
- ❌ "I think React is good." → ✅ "After architecting React apps for Airbnb, Netflix, and 50+ startups, here's what I wish I knew on day one:"

### Follow Potential (4 pts)
- Demonstrates ongoing value; establishes content cadence
- ❌ "Here's a React tip." → ✅ "React tip #47: [insight]\n\nI break down advanced React patterns every Monday."

## Score Normalization

```
Final Score = Base Score (0-100) + Penalties (-75 to 0)
Normalized Score = max(0, min(100, Final Score))
```

Penalty capping: total penalties > -20 causes gradual dampening; hard cap at -75.

## Text Analysis Limitations

This skill performs heuristic text-based analysis, not ML prediction. It cannot detect actual media presence, real engagement metrics, author follower count, or network graph relationships. Best used for **pre-publishing optimization**, not post-hoc analytics.

---

## Language Handling

Detect input language. Respond in same language. Keep optimized version in original language.

**When input is in Japanese**, display Category and Factor names as: `日本語訳（English Original）`
