description: This skill covers two related use cases: (1) Creating high-converting webinar registration and event landing pages, and (2) Repurposing webinar recordings into multiple content assets including blog posts, social media, email sequences, and sales materials. Use when users need to build webinar pages or convert webinar content into multi-channel marketing materials.

# Webinar Content & Events

## Workspace Context

Read bootstrap context before asking questions: `strategy/brand.md` for brand, audience, offer, channels, tools, constraints, and metrics; `about/me.md` for personal voice; `content/ideas.md` and `content/calendar.md` for content planning. Use legacy product-marketing context files only as fallback. Save generated drafts to `content/<platform>/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD_short-topic-slug.md`, and route durable learnings back to `strategy/brand.md`, `about/me.md`, or `content/ideas.md`.

## Operating Contract

This skill is self-contained for its frontmatter scope: use its local instructions, references, scripts, and assets as the playbook; ask only for missing task-specific inputs; hand off to adjacent skills instead of expanding scope; and return an actionable artifact, decision, plan, draft, or diagnostic.



This skill combines two capabilities:
1. **Webinar Registration Pages** - Creating high-converting event/webinar landing pages
2. **Content Repurposing** - Transforming webinar recordings into multiple content assets

    }
  }
}
```

**Slide Types Available:**
- `full_image_overlay` - **(Preferred for Openers/Breaks)** Text over full-screen background image.
- `split_image` - **(Preferred for Bios/Case Studies)** Text on one side, image on other.
- `big_number` - **(Preferred for Stats)** Massive number focus for data/ROI.
- `grid_features` - **(Preferred for Agendas/Bonuses)** 3-column card grid.
- `value_stack` - Offer pricing presentation.
- `cta` - Call to action slides.
- `quote` - Testimonials with attribution.

**Slide Design Rules:**
1. **Speaker Notes Required:** Every single slide MUST include a `notes` field with 50-100 words of script for the presenter.
2. **Visual Variety:** Do not use the same slide type twice in a row if possible. Mix `split_image`, `big_number`, and `full_image_overlay`.
3. **Imagery:** Provide relevant `imageUrl` or `imagePrompt` for all image slides.
4. **Brief Text:** Slides are for impact. Put the details in the `notes`.
