# OKX CEX Earn CLI

## Preflight

Before running any command, follow [`../_shared/preflight.md`](../_shared/preflight.md).
Use `metadata.version` from this file's frontmatter as the reference for Step 2.

## Prerequisites

1. Install `okx` CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @okx_ai/okx-trade-cli
   ```
2. Configure credentials:
   ```bash
   okx config init   # select site -> follow browser OAuth flow
   ```
3. Verify: `okx earn savings balance`

> **Security**: NEVER accept credentials in chat. Guide users to `okx config init` for setup.

---

## Credential & Profile Check

Run **both** commands before any authenticated command — the `apiKey` field from `okx auth status --json` is the auth-binary's internal state and is always `false` regardless of whether `~/.okx/config.toml` has an API-key profile. `okx config show --json` is the only authoritative source for API-key presence. The auth method is detected during [preflight](../_shared/preflight.md) Step 2 and remembered for the session.

```bash
okx config show --json      # reveals API-key profiles (TOML config)
okx auth status --json      # reveals OAuth session state (auth-binary state)
```

Apply **in this order** — first match wins:

- `config show --json` has any profile with a non-empty `api_key` field → **API Key mode**. Proceed.
- No API-key profile **AND** `auth status --json` returns `"status":"logged_in"` → **OAuth mode**. Proceed.
- No API-key profile **AND** `"status":"pending"` — login is in progress, wait for it to complete.
- No API-key profile **AND** `"status":"not_logged_in"` — **stop**, load `okx-cex-auth` skill and follow login steps, wait for completion.

OKX Earn does not support demo mode. Always use live mode silently — don't mention it unless there's an error.
- **API Key users**: use `--profile <live-profile>` (the profile without `demo=true`).
- **OAuth users**: no flag needed (live is the default).

**On authentication errors (401 / "Session expired" / "Run `okx auth login` first"):** stop immediately, load `okx-cex-auth` skill and follow re-authentication steps, then retry.

## Operation Flow

### Step 0 — Credential & Profile Check

Before any authenticated command: see [Credential & Profile Check](#credential--profile-check). Always use live mode silently.

### Step 1 — Identify earn intent

**Simple Earn Flexible (活期):**
- Query balance / history / rates → READ command, proceed directly.
- Subscribe / redeem / set-rate → WRITE command, go to Step 2.

**Simple Earn Fixed (定期):**
- Browse available products / check quota → `earn savings fixed-products [--ccy]`. This is the dedicated tool for querying the fixed-term product pool — use it whenever the user asks about available fixed earn products, remaining quota, or APR.
- Query user's existing orders → `earn savings fixed-orders [--ccy] [--state]`.
- Subscribe (two-step: preview then confirm) / redeem (pending state only) → WRITE command, go to Step 2. Read `{baseDir}/references/savings-commands.md` for pre-execution checklists and confirmation templates.
- For multi-step workflows (subscribe with preview, early redemption), read `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md`.

**On-chain Earn:**
- Query offers / orders / history → READ command, proceed directly.
- Purchase / redeem / cancel → WRITE command, go to Step 2.

**AutoEarn (自动赚币):**
- Query auto-earn status → READ, proceed directly.
- Enable / disable auto-earn → WRITE, go to Step 2. Read `{baseDir}/references/autoearn-commands.md` for confirmation templates and earnType inference.

**Flash Earn (闪赚):**
- Browse projects → READ, proceed directly.
- Use `--status 0` for upcoming projects, `--status 100` for in-progress projects, or omit the flag to view both.

When user asks to view "earn positions" or "赚币持仓" (regardless of whether they mention DCD explicitly), query all position-bearing sub-modules simultaneously (Flash Earn is query-only, no positions):

```bash
okx earn savings balance --json        # Simple Earn Flexible (活期)
okx earn savings fixed-orders --json   # Simple Earn Fixed (定期)
okx earn onchain orders --json         # On-chain Earn
okx earn dcd orders --json             # Dual Investment (双币赢)
```

Only present sections that have actual holdings. For DCD: translate state codes using the table in `{baseDir}/references/dcd-commands.md`.

**Dual Investment (DCD / 双币赢):**
- Browse products / pairs → READ; when user specifies a currency, read `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md` (DCD browse flow) for the mandatory parallel pre-fetch before rendering the product table
- Subscribe (quote-and-buy) → WRITE → see `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md` (DCD subscribe flow)
- Early redeem → WRITE → see `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md` (DCD early redeem flow)

For multi-step workflows (idle fund analysis, subscribe + verify, redeem + transfer, on-chain subscribe), read `{baseDir}/references/workflows.md`.

### Step 2 — Confirm write operation

For all WRITE commands, present a summary and wait for explicit confirmation.

> "just do it" / "直接搞" is NOT valid confirmation — the user must see the summary first.

For Simple Earn confirmation dialog format, read `{baseDir}/references/savings-commands.md`. For On-chain confirmation, read `{baseDir}/references/onchain-commands.md`.

### Step 3 — Execute and verify

After any purchase, verify based on product type:
- **DCD** `quote-and-buy` succeeded → run `earn dcd orders --json`, show only the matching order.
- **On-chain** purchase (response contains `ordId`) → run `earn onchain orders --json`, show only the matching order.
- **Simple Earn Flexible** purchase (no `ordId` in response) → run `earn savings balance --ccy <ccy> --json`.
- **Simple Earn Fixed** purchase → run `earn savings fixed-orders --ccy <ccy> --state pending --json`, show the new order.

**Simple Earn Flexible purchase:** Run in parallel — `earn savings balance --ccy <ccy>` and `earn savings rate-history --ccy <ccy> --limit 1 --json`. For output format, read `{baseDir}/references/savings-commands.md`.

**Simple Earn Flexible redeem:** Run `earn savings balance --ccy <ccy>` to confirm updated balance. Inform user funds returned to funding account.

**Simple Earn Fixed purchase:** Run `earn savings fixed-orders --ccy <ccy> --state pending --json` to confirm the order was created. Show order details including APR, term, and expected expiry date.

**Simple Earn Fixed redeem:** Run `earn savings fixed-orders --json` to confirm the order state changed to `cancelled`. Inform user full principal returned to funding account — no interest earned for early cancellation.

**On-chain redeem:** Query `earn onchain orders` to confirm state. Show `estSettlementTime` as estimated arrival time.

**On-chain cancel:** Query `earn onchain orders` after submission:
- Order gone from list → inform user: cancellation complete, funds returned to funding account.
- `state: 3` (cancelling) → inform user: cancellation in progress, funds will return to funding account shortly.

## Global Notes

- **Security:** Never ask users to paste API keys or secrets into chat.
- **Output:** Always pass `--json` to list/query commands and render results as a Markdown table — never paste raw terminal output.
- **Network errors:** If commands fail with a connection error, prompt user to check VPN: `curl -I https://www.okx.com`
- **Language:** Always respond in the user's language.

For number/time formatting and response structure conventions, read `{baseDir}/references/templates.md`.
