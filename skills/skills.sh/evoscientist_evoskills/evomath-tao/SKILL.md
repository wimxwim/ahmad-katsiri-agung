# EvoMath (Tao-style)

EvoMath is a lightweight proof workflow for contest-style mathematical
reasoning. Its job is to produce a rigorous proof, a verified counterexample, a
useful partial result, or a clear handoff. Keep the process small; do not run a
heavy audit pipeline by default.

## Methodology Anchor — Terence Tao's Research-Math Practice

This skill operationalizes the way Terence Tao approaches research mathematics:

1. **Compute small cases first** (Kepler before Newton) — build intuition from data before reaching for theory.
2. **Try the standard toolbox broadly before going deep** — most hard problems crack to a standard technique; the few that don't only reveal which after several have failed.
3. **Hold rigor and intuition together** (post-rigorous mathematics) — trust intuition, but verify every step. "It feels right" is a hypothesis, not a proof.
4. **Atomize when stuck** — decompose into independently checkable sub-claims. A clean map of proved / conjectured / open beats a polished but shaky narrative.
5. **Stay honest about what isn't proved** — distinguish PROVED / VERIFIED_NUMERICALLY / CONJECTURED / HANDED_OFF. When blocked, name the precise gap.
6. **Distill each result into reusable insight** — after every problem, extract what worked into a strategy and what failed into a named pattern. Mathematical maturity is accumulated meta-insight.

Every phase below is a concrete operationalization of one or more of these principles.

## Operating Rules

- Use Markdown notes for handoff between steps. Do not require JSON/YAML unless
  a script explicitly asks for it.
- Keep only compact state: plan, verified claims, failed attempts, final audit.
  Do not pass long failed derivations into later prompts.
- Prefer a few independent proof attempts over one long derivation.
- **Numerical verification is NOT a proof step** (math-olympiad rule). Checking
  a claim on n=1..100 and finding no counterexample does NOT make it PROVED;
  the strongest label such evidence can earn is VERIFIED_NUMERICALLY.
- Exact arithmetic can refute; approximate numerics only suggest.
- A proof is final only after an adversarial check of the clean proof.
- **Calibrated abstention over bluffing**: when verification fails repeatedly,
  admit it. Return partial results and mark unfixed gaps explicitly (math-
  olympiad rule). Final status HANDED_OFF with a structured wall report is
  always preferable to PROVED with hand-waved gaps.
- Every final answer must include a visible `final-status: ...` line.
- Use TodoWrite to drive the workflow. Each step is one todo; you cannot mark a
  todo completed unless the corresponding `.md` file passes its validator.

If filesystem access is available, create a Markdown workspace with:

```bash
python skills/evomath-tao/scripts/evomath_workspace.py init --dir .evomath/current
```

If filesystem access is not available, keep the same Markdown sections inline in
the conversation. In that case run the validators by mentally checking the same
required fields the script checks — the discipline is the same.

## Fast Exit

Do not use EvoMath for single calculations, definition lookups, symbolic
manipulation, or answer-only requests with no proof obligation. Give the direct
answer instead. No TodoWrite list is needed for a Fast Exit.

If the statement has a blocking ambiguity that changes truth value, ask one
specific clarification question before solving.

## Execution Protocol (TodoWrite + Validation)

For any problem that passes the Fast Exit Gate, follow this protocol.

### 1. Create the 5-step todo list

Before doing any solving work, call TodoWrite with these five items in this
order. Each item names its primary reference file:

1. **Plan Briefly** — read `references/intake-checklist.md` for type
   classification, ambiguity handling, goal types.
2. **Try Candidates** — read `references/angles-by-type.md` for technique ideas
   if you are out of angles for this problem type.
3. **Assemble** — read `references/output-formats.md` if you need formatting
   conventions or LaTeX templates.
4. **Audit** — read `references/grading-taxonomy.md` for issue classes and
   severity rules. Read `references/phase-4-audit.md` only if the user requests
   strict multi-reviewer audit.
5. **Reflect** — read `references/claim-memory.md` only when deep reflection is
   triggered (see "Deep Reflection Triggers" below).

### 2. Per-step discipline

For each step in order:

1. Mark the todo `in_progress` before reading the reference or writing output.
2. Read the referenced file(s) if and only if you need them for this step.
3. Produce the corresponding `.md` output (plan.md, candidates.md, audit.md,
   final.md sections, etc.).
4. Run the validator before marking the todo completed:

   ```bash
   python skills/evomath-tao/scripts/evomath_workspace.py validate-phase <N> --dir .evomath/current
   ```

5. If validation FAILS, the todo stays `in_progress`. Revise the `.md` file
   based on the printed failure messages and re-run the validator. Do not mark
   completed until the validator exits 0.

### 3. PROVED gate

If your final-status is `PROVED`, you MUST additionally run:

```bash
python skills/evomath-tao/scripts/evomath_workspace.py validate-proved --dir .evomath/current
```

This verifies that the 10-item PROVED Self-Check Checklist (see
`references/output-formats.md`) is present in final.md with all boxes ticked.
If this fails, downgrade final-status to CONJECTURED or HANDED_OFF and revise
the answer.

### 4. Deep Reflection Triggers

Step 5 (Reflect) has two modes:

- **Light reflection** (default): three lines — successful pattern, failed
  pattern to avoid, whether memory was written.
- **Deep reflection** (triggered when any of the following hold):
  - Step 2 required 3+ revision rounds for any candidate
  - Step 4 identified a fatal flaw before the final repair
  - A new winning technique appeared that is not yet in any L2 strategy entry
  - The user explicitly asks for self-evolution or cross-problem learning
  - final-status is HANDED_OFF with a recurring failure-mode

  In deep reflection mode, run the full ESE/IVE protocols described in
  `references/claim-memory.md` and update L2/L3 memory in
  `.evomath/session-memory.md`.

### 5. Fallback when filesystem is unavailable

If you cannot run scripts, keep the same TodoWrite discipline:
- Still create the 5-item list and march through it.
- Still keep the same `.md` sections inline in the conversation.
- Substitute mental validation for the script call — check the same required
  fields the validator would check.

## Workflow

### 1. Plan Briefly

Write a short Markdown plan:

- Problem type: algebra, geometry, number theory, combinatorics, analysis, or
  other.
- Goal: prove, refute, find example, or audit proof.
- Strategy: one sentence.
- Subgoals: at most five bullets.

For "determine all" problems, include both:

- existence/construction
- impossibility/exclusion

For a simple problem, one root subgoal is enough.

### 2. Try Candidates

**Mode dispatch** (decide before generating):

- If Phase 0 `goal = find-numeric-answer` (AIME-style: answer is a single
  number, no proof required) → **AIME mode**: generate 5–7 short candidate
  answers using varied approaches (small-case enumeration, modular invariants,
  algebraic manipulation, generating functions, brute-force code). Take
  majority vote across candidates. Verify the top two by substitution into the
  original problem. Skip the rest of the proof workflow; output the numeric
  answer with `final-status: PROVED` only when both top candidates agree AND
  substitution checks pass.
- Otherwise → **Proof mode**: continue below.

**Proof mode — per-candidate 5-round internal loop**:

For each active subgoal, try up to four genuinely different candidate routes.
Each candidate is itself the product of a 5-round internal mini-process — not
a one-shot generation:

1. **Solve** — produce a proof attempt using reasoning only. **No tool use
   during this round** (no calculator, sympy, Lean, web). Pure pencil-and-paper.
2. **Self-improve** — refine the attempt for clarity, fix obvious gaps.
3. **Self-verify** — walk through line by line, looking for: shielding words
   ("obviously"/"clearly"), unjustified swaps, missing hypotheses, off-by-one
   cases, hidden assumptions.
4. **Correct** — fix issues found in step 3.
5. Repeat 1–4 up to **5 times** per candidate, or until the candidate self-
   reports as `is_sound`.

Each candidate's internal-rounds count is recorded so Phase 4 can see how much
self-revision was needed. A candidate that needs 5 rounds is more likely to be
borderline than one that's sound in 1.

Record candidates in this Markdown table:

| Candidate | Idea | Internal rounds | Verdict | Issue or reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 |  | 1–5 | sound / repair / fail |  |

Judging a candidate:

- `sound`: enough to use as a verified claim.
- `repair`: promising but missing a local step; revise at most twice **outside**
  the 5-round internal loop (so total max revisions = 5 internal + 2 external).
- `fail`: wrong, circular, too weak, or repeats a known dead end.

**Computation discipline (math-olympiad VERBATIM rule)**: during the Solve
round, no tool calls. Computation is allowed in Phase 1 (Empirical) and in
Phase 5 Deep Mode, NEVER during Phase 2 Solve. This protects against
ritualized "I called sympy so it must be right" reasoning.

When a candidate is sound, add it to **Proof Artifact / Verified Claims** with
a one-paragraph proof summary. When a route fails, add one line to **Negative
Attempts** so it is not repeated.

Use `references/angles-by-type.md` only when you are out of ideas for a problem
type. Do not load it by default.

### 3. Assemble

Turn the accepted claims into a clean proof or refutation.

Rules:

- State the original claim.
- Present the final argument only; omit failed attempts.
- Justify every non-trivial step by a verified claim, theorem, construction, or exact
  computation.
- If a required subgoal remains unsolved, stop pretending the proof is complete:
  output a partial result or handoff.

### 4. Audit

Audit only the clean proof, not the exploration notes.

Check:

- The proof proves the original statement, not a weaker restatement.
- All cases, boundary values, degeneracies, and quantifiers are handled.
- No claim is cited without proof or explicit acceptance in the Proof Artifact.
- Refutations use an exactly verified counterexample.

**Audit follows math-olympiad's 3-safeguard pattern** (see `references/phase-4-audit.md`):
1. Verifier context isolation (strip thinking traces before review).
2. Asymmetric voting (4 HOLDS to confirm; 2 HOLE FOUND to refute).
3. Pigeonhole exit (stop launching reviewers after threshold).

Apply the named-pattern screen (P4 / P5 / P6 / P18 / P40 / P41 in `grading-taxonomy.md`) plus the counterexample-first rule before any PROVED award.

For ordinary use, one careful local audit is enough. Use the heavier
`references/phase-4-audit.md` protocol only when the user asks for strict
multi-reviewer audit or when the result is high-risk.

### 5. Reflect

After the final answer, add a short reflection note. It should be compact:

- successful pattern, if any
- failed pattern to avoid
- whether memory was written

Per-problem memory resets at the next problem. Cross-problem memory is optional:
write only compact strategy/failure summaries to `.evomath/session-memory.json`
when file access is available. If not written, say `memory-persisted: false`.

## Status Labels

Use exactly one:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PROVED` | Complete proof of the original statement passed Safeguards 1–3 audit. The strongest label EvoMath awards. |
| `REFUTED` | Exact counterexample or contradiction proof found |
| `VERIFIED_NUMERICALLY` | Finite exact checks only; no general proof. Numerical evidence is NOT a proof — this label exists to record empirical support honestly. |
| `CONJECTURED` | Strong partial evidence or partial proof, but incomplete |
| `HANDED_OFF` | Stopped with a precise remaining gap or user question |

Exactly one of these five labels must appear in every final answer. See `references/confidence-rules.md` for award conditions and promotion rules.

## Final Answer Shape

Use Markdown, not a rigid schema:

```markdown
final-status: PROVED

## Result
<answer>

## Proof / Report
<clean proof, refutation, audit report, partial result, or handoff>

## Audit
- audits-run:
- critical-issues:
- remaining-gaps:

## Proof Artifact
- verified claims:
- negative attempts:

## Reflection
- memory-persisted:
- storage-location:
- proposed-memory-updates:
```

For proof-audit requests, lead with findings ordered by severity, then give the
verdict and suggested repair.

## Optional Helpers

- `scripts/evomath_workspace.py`:
  - `init`         creates the five Markdown state files.
  - `check`        verifies `final.md` has a valid `final-status:` line.
  - `validate-phase N`  validates the .md output for step N (1..5). Use this
    before marking the corresponding todo completed. Add `--strict` to also
    re-validate all prior steps.
  - `validate-proved`  when final-status is PROVED, verifies the 10-item
    Self-Check Checklist is fully ticked.
- `references/angles-by-type.md`: technique ideas by problem type.
- `references/grading-taxonomy.md`: detailed flaw taxonomy for audits.
- `references/phase-4-audit.md`: heavier independent-review protocol.
- `references/output-formats.md`: optional Markdown/LaTeX formatting details +
  the PROVED Self-Check Checklist template.
- `references/claim-memory.md`: three-layer memory architecture and ESE/IVE
  reflection protocols. Read only in deep-reflection mode.
- `references/model-tier.md`: per-tier parameter table (Haiku / Sonnet /
  Opus). Read once at the start of Phase 0 to set K, internal-rounds, audit
  passes, and abstain thresholds for the active model.
