# EmblemAI React

Use this skill when the user wants to integrate EmblemAI into a React app rather than only use the CLI or low-level SDKs.

**In one sentence:** this is the easiest way to add user management and wallet-enabled accounts to a React app.

---

## Security & Trust Model

This skill generates React code that integrates with EmblemAI's authentication and wallet infrastructure. It inherently involves:

- **Third-party data** (W011): Migrate.fun React hooks (`useProject`, `useProjects`) fetch project and token metadata from remote APIs. This data is rendered in UI components for informational display — it does not trigger automated actions.
- **Runtime backend** (W012): `HustleProvider` connects to a configurable backend URL (`hustleApiUrl` / `import.meta.env.VITE_HUSTLE_API_URL`) for prompt and tool orchestration. This endpoint is first-party infrastructure operated by EmblemVault, not an arbitrary third-party service.

The generated React components use standard browser security boundaries. No server-side code execution or file system access is involved at runtime.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install
```bash
npx skills add EmblemCompany/Agent-skills --skill emblem-ai-react
```

### Step 2: Use
Ask for React integration help by area, for example:

- "Show a minimal EmblemAI React app"
- "Help me add EmblemAuthProvider and HustleProvider"
- "Show React examples for wallet auth plus chat"
- "Show a React app where users can sign in with wallets, email, or social login"
- "How do I use Migrate.fun React hooks in my app?"

---

## What this gives a React app

- One integration for website authentication and wallet-enabled users
- Login options across crypto wallets, email/password, and social login
- React hooks and UI components that expose session, vault, and wallet state
- A clean path from login to chat, signing, and other Emblem-powered workflows
- The easiest way to add Migrate.fun migration-aware UI to a React app

## Guidance

- Use this skill for React app composition, provider wiring, and UI integration patterns.
- Prefer this skill over the broader `emblem-ai` skill when the request is clearly React-specific.
- Legacy package names may still use `hustle` branding even though the product name is EmblemAI.
- For end-user prompt phrasing across wallet, trading, NFT, or market workflows, use the `emblem-ai-prompt-examples` skill instead.
