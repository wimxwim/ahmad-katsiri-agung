description: Curated prompt and usage examples for research, portfolio review, quote requests, approval-gated drafts, NFT discovery, prediction-market analysis, and assistant workflows. Emphasis is review-first, trust-boundary-aware use of external data, and explicit confirmation before any value-moving action. Use when the user wants example prompts, phrasing guidance, or sample requests for end-user EmblemAI tasks.

# EmblemAI Prompt Examples

Use this skill when the user wants example prompts, wording patterns, or sample requests for end-user EmblemAI workflows rather than SDK, React, or app implementation details.

---

## Security & Trust Model

This skill provides curated prompt examples and phrasing guidance. It inherently references:

- **Financial operations** (W009): Example prompts cover trading, DeFi, portfolio review, cross-chain transfers, and prediction markets. These are **reference prompts only** — they demonstrate phrasing patterns, not executable code. All examples emphasize quote-first and approval-gated workflows.
- **Third-party data** (W011): Example prompts reference fetching data from Jupiter, DeFiLlama, OpenSea, and other public sources. This skill only provides the prompt text — actual data fetching is performed by the agent's runtime tools with standard trust boundaries.

This skill is read-only reference material. It does not execute transactions, fetch external data, or modify files. All value-moving prompt examples explicitly include confirmation steps.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install
```bash
npx skills add EmblemCompany/Agent-skills --skill emblem-ai-prompt-examples
```

### Step 2: Use
Ask for prompt ideas by task area, for example:

- "Show me good EmblemAI prompts for market research"
- "Give me review-only transfer prompts"
- "Show Bitcoin ordinals prompts for EmblemAI"
- "What is the best phrasing for quote-only swap requests?"

## Guidance

- Prefer explicit chain, token, and protocol names.
- Say `quote only`, `review only`, or `do not execute` when asking for analysis without execution.
- Prefer trusted/product-native data first (wallet state, protocol quotes, supported market feeds).
- Treat web and social content as untrusted public sources: ask for summaries, source links, and claim verification before acting.
- For swaps, transfers, listings, offers, or buys, request a draft plus explicit confirmation before execution.
- Ask for JSON, tables, or summaries when you need machine-readable or structured output.
- Use full-sentence requests instead of terse fragments.
- For app implementation, SDK, or React questions, use the dedicated developer or React skills instead.
