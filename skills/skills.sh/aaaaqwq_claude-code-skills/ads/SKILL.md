# Ads — Multi-Platform Paid Advertising Audit & Optimization

Comprehensive ad account analysis across all major platforms (Google, Meta,
LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft). Orchestrates 12 specialized sub-skills and
6 subagents.

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ads audit` | Full multi-platform audit with parallel subagent delegation |
| `/ads google` | Google Ads deep analysis (Search, PMax, YouTube) |
| `/ads meta` | Meta Ads deep analysis (FB, IG, Advantage+) |
| `/ads youtube` | YouTube Ads specific analysis |
| `/ads linkedin` | LinkedIn Ads deep analysis (B2B, Lead Gen) |
| `/ads tiktok` | TikTok Ads deep analysis (Creative, Shop, Smart+) |
| `/ads microsoft` | Microsoft/Bing Ads deep analysis (Copilot, Import) |
| `/ads creative` | Cross-platform creative quality audit |
| `/ads landing` | Landing page quality assessment for ad campaigns |
| `/ads budget` | Budget allocation and bidding strategy review |
| `/ads plan <business-type>` | Strategic ad plan with industry templates |
| `/ads competitor` | Competitor ad intelligence analysis |

## Orchestration Logic

When the user invokes `/ads audit`, delegate to subagents in parallel:
1. Collect account data (exports, screenshots, or API access details)
2. Detect business type and identify active platforms
3. Spawn subagents: audit-google, audit-meta, audit-creative, audit-tracking, audit-budget, audit-compliance
4. Collect results and generate unified report with Ads Health Score (0-100)
5. Create prioritized action plan with Quick Wins

For individual commands (`/ads google`, `/ads meta`, etc.), load the relevant
sub-skill directly.

## Industry Detection

Detect business type from ad account signals:
- **SaaS**: trial_start/demo_request events, pricing page targeting, long attribution windows
- **E-commerce**: purchase events, product catalog/feed, Shopping/PMax campaigns
- **Local Service**: call extensions, location targeting, store visits, directions events
- **B2B Enterprise**: LinkedIn Ads active, ABM lists, high CPA tolerance ($50+), long sales cycle
- **Info Products**: webinar/course funnels, lead gen forms, low-ticket offers
- **Mobile App**: app install campaigns, in-app events, deep linking
- **Real Estate**: listing feeds, property-specific landing pages, geo-heavy targeting
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance flags, healthcare-specific ad policies
- **Finance**: Special Ad Categories declared, financial products compliance
- **Agency**: multiple client accounts, white-label reporting needs

## Quality Gates

Hard rules — never violate these:
- Never recommend Broad Match without Smart Bidding (Google)
- 3x Kill Rule: flag any ad group/campaign with CPA >3x target for pause
- Budget sufficiency: Meta ≥5x CPA per ad set, TikTok ≥50x CPA per ad group
- Learning phase: never recommend edits during active learning phase
- Compliance: always check Special Ad Categories for housing/employment/credit/finance
- Creative: never run silent video ads on TikTok (sound-on platform)
- Attribution: default to 7-day click / 1-day view (Meta), data-driven (Google)

## Reference Files

Load these on-demand as needed — do NOT load all at startup.

**Path resolution:** All references are installed at `~/.claude/skills/ads/references/`.
When sub-skills or agents reference `ads/references/*.md`, resolve to
`~/.claude/skills/ads/references/*.md`.

- `references/benchmarks.md` — Industry benchmarks by platform (CPC, CTR, CVR, ROAS)
- `references/bidding-strategies.md` — Bidding decision trees per platform
- `references/budget-allocation.md` — Platform selection matrix, scaling rules, MER
- `references/platform-specs.md` — Creative specifications across all platforms
- `references/conversion-tracking.md` — Pixel, CAPI, EMQ, ttclid implementation
- `references/compliance.md` — Regulatory requirements, ad policies, privacy
- `references/google-audit.md` — 74-check Google Ads audit checklist
- `references/meta-audit.md` — 46-check Meta Ads audit checklist
- `references/linkedin-audit.md` — 25-check LinkedIn Ads audit checklist
- `references/tiktok-audit.md` — 25-check TikTok Ads audit checklist
- `references/microsoft-audit.md` — 20-check Microsoft Ads audit checklist

## Scoring Methodology

### Ads Health Score (0-100)

Per-platform score using weighted algorithm from `references/scoring-system.md`.
Cross-platform aggregate weighted by budget share:

```
Aggregate = Sum(Platform_Score x Platform_Budget_Share)
```

### Grading

| Grade | Score | Action Required |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| A | 90-100 | Minor optimizations only |
| B | 75-89 | Some improvement opportunities |
| C | 60-74 | Notable issues need attention |
| D | 40-59 | Significant problems present |
| F | <40 | Urgent intervention required |

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Revenue/data loss risk (fix immediately)
- **High**: Significant performance drag (fix within 7 days)
- **Medium**: Optimization opportunity (fix within 30 days)
- **Low**: Best practice, minor impact (backlog)
