# Competitive Teardown

**Tier:** POWERFUL  
**Category:** Product Team  
**Domain:** Competitive Intelligence, Product Strategy, Market Analysis

---

## Overview

Run a structured competitive analysis on any product or company. Synthesizes data from pricing pages, app store reviews, job postings, SEO signals, and social media into actionable insights: feature matrices, SWOT, positioning maps, UX audits, and a stakeholder presentation template.

---

## Core Capabilities

- Feature comparison matrix (scored 1-5 across 12 dimensions)
- Pricing model analysis (per-seat, usage-based, flat rate)
- SWOT analysis
- Positioning map (2x2 matrix)
- UX audit (onboarding, key workflows, mobile)
- Content strategy gap analysis
- Action item roadmap (quick wins / medium-term / strategic)
- Stakeholder presentation template

---

## When to Use

- Before a product strategy or roadmap session
- When a competitor launches a major feature or pricing change
- Quarterly competitive review
- Before a sales pitch where you need battle card data
- When entering a new market segment

---

## Data Collection Guide

### 1. Website Analysis

```bash
# Scrape pricing page structure
curl -s "https://competitor.com/pricing" | \
  python3 -c "
import sys
from html.parser import HTMLParser

class TextExtractor(HTMLParser):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.text = []
    def handle_data(self, data):
        if data.strip():
            self.text.append(data.strip())

p = TextExtractor()
p.feed(sys.stdin.read())
print('\n'.join(p.text[:200]))
"

# Check changelog / release notes
curl -s "https://competitor.com/changelog" | grep -i "added\|new\|launched\|improved"

# Feature list from sitemap
curl -s "https://competitor.com/sitemap.xml" | grep -oP '(?<=<loc>)[^<]+' | head -50
```

Key things to capture from the website:
- Pricing tiers and price points
- Feature lists per tier
- Primary CTA and messaging
- Case studies / customer logos (signals ICP)
- Integration logos
- Trust signals (certifications, compliance badges)

### 2. App Store Reviews

```bash
# iOS reviews via RSS
curl "https://itunes.apple.com/rss/customerreviews/id=[APP_ID]/sortBy=mostRecent/json" | \
  python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
entries = data.get('feed', {}).get('entry', [])
for e in entries[1:]:  # skip first (app metadata)
    rating = e.get('im:rating', {}).get('label', '?')
    title = e.get('title', {}).get('label', '')
    content = e.get('content', {}).get('label', '')
    print(f'[{rating}] {title}: {content[:200]}')
"

# Google Play via scraping (use playwright or a reviews API)
# Categorize reviews into: praise / feature requests / bugs / UX complaints
```

Review sentiment categories:
- **Praise** → what users love (defend / strengthen these)
- **Feature requests** → unmet needs (opportunity gaps)
- **Bugs** → quality signals
- **UX complaints** → friction points you can beat them on

### 3. Job Postings (Team Size & Tech Stack Signals)

```python
# Search LinkedIn / Greenhouse / Lever / Workable
import requests

# Example: scrape Greenhouse job board
def get_jobs(company_token):
    r = requests.get(f"https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{company_token}/jobs")
    return r.json().get('jobs', [])

jobs = get_jobs("competitor-name")
departments = {}
for job in jobs:
    dept = job.get('departments', [{}])[0].get('name', 'Unknown')
    departments[dept] = departments.get(dept, 0) + 1

print("Team breakdown by open roles:")
for dept, count in sorted(departments.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1]):
    print(f"  {dept}: {count} open roles")
```

Signals from job postings:
- **Engineering volume** → scaling vs. consolidating
- **Specific tech mentions** → stack (React/Vue, Postgres/Mongo, AWS/GCP)
- **Sales/CS ratio** → product-led vs. sales-led motion
- **Data/ML roles** → upcoming AI features
- **Compliance roles** → regulatory expansion

### 4. SEO Analysis

```bash
# Organic keyword gap (using Ahrefs/Semrush API or free alternatives)
# Ubersuggest, SpyFu, or SimilarWeb free tiers

# Quick domain overview via Moz free API
curl "https://moz.com/api/free/v2/url-metrics?targets[]=competitor.com" \
  -H "x-moz-token: YOUR_TOKEN"

# Check their blog topics (sitemap)
curl "https://competitor.com/sitemap-posts.xml" | \
  grep -oP '(?<=<loc>)[^<]+' | \
  sed 's|.*/||' | \
  tr '-' ' '
```

SEO signals to capture:
- Top 20 organic keywords (intent: informational / navigational / commercial)
- Domain Authority / backlink count
- Blog publishing cadence and topics
- Which pages rank (product pages vs. blog vs. docs)

### 5. Social Media Sentiment

```bash
# Twitter/X search (via API v2)
curl "https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=%40competitor+OR+%22competitor+name%22&max_results=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN" | \
  python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
tweets = data.get('data', [])
for t in tweets:
    print(t['text'][:150])
"
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Recency bias** - Pricing pages change; always date-stamp your data
2. **Feature theater** - A competitor may list a feature that barely works; check reviews
3. **Vanity metrics** - "10,000 integrations" via Zapier != 10,000 native integrations
4. **Ignoring momentum** - A weaker competitor growing 3x YoY is a bigger threat than a stronger one shrinking
5. **Only comparing features** - Brand perception and community often matter more than features
6. **Single-source analysis** - Website alone misses the real user experience; always add reviews

---

## Best Practices

- Run teardowns quarterly; competitors move fast
- Assign a DRI (directly responsible individual) for each major competitor
- Build a "battle card" 1-pager per competitor for sales to use
- Track competitor job postings monthly as a leading indicator of product direction
- Screenshot pricing pages — they change and you want the history
- Include a "what we copied from them" section internally — intellectual honesty builds better products
