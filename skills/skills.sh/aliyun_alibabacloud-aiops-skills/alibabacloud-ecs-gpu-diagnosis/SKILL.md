## Usage Instructions

Initiate diagnosis on a specified ECS GPU instance to detect GPU device status and output diagnosis results.

## Execution Constraints

- All steps MUST be executed in order; skipping steps is NOT permitted
- Each step MUST be verified as successful before proceeding to the next
- Inform the user of the current step being executed
- If any step fails, user confirmation MUST be obtained before continuing

### Prerequisites

1. **Check Alibaba Cloud CLI Environment**
   - Execute `which aliyun` or `aliyun --version` to check if CLI is installed
   - If not installed, inform the user that Alibaba Cloud CLI needs to be installed and provide installation guidance from `references/cli-installation.md`:
     - macOS: Homebrew installation or manual installation (Intel/Apple Silicon)
     - Linux: Download installation package for corresponding architecture (x86_64/ARM64)
     - Windows: Download installation package and configure PATH, or use PowerShell installation
   - After installation, run `aliyun version` to confirm version >= 3.0.299
   - MUST run `aliyun plugin update` to ensure local plugins are up-to-date.
   - Confirm CLI is configured with AccessKey: `aliyun configure`
   - At the **start** of the Core Workflow (before any CLI invocation):
    - **[MUST] Enable AI-Mode** — AI-mode is required for Agent Skill execution.
     ```bash
     aliyun configure ai-mode enable
     aliyun configure ai-mode set-user-agent --user-agent "AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-ecs-gpu-diagnosis"
     ```
   - At the **end** of the workflow (after success or failure):
    - **[MUST] Disable AI-Mode** — AI-mode must be disabled after skill execution completes.
     ```bash
     aliyun configure ai-mode disable
     ```
   - **Permission Reminder**: Remind the user that the current RAM user needs the permissions to execute GPU diagnosis from `references/ram-policies.md` :

2. **Obtain Required Parameters**
   - Check if `INSTANCE_ID` is provided (ECS instance ID, format MUST match this regular expression ^i-[a-z0-9]{20}$ )
   - Check if `REGION_ID` is provided (region ID, like cn-shanghai)
   - If either parameter is missing, ask the user:
     - "Please provide the ECS instance ID to diagnose (format: i-bp1xxxxx)"
     - "Please provide the region ID where the instance is located (e.g., cn-shanghai, cn-hangzhou)"

3. **Validate Parameters**
   - **Validate INSTANCE_ID format**: Check if `INSTANCE_ID` matches the regex pattern `^i-[a-z0-9]{20}$`
     - If validation fails, inform the user: "Invalid instance ID format. Instance ID must match the pattern ^i-[a-z0-9]{20}$"
   - **Validate REGION_ID**: Query available regions using describe-regions API to verify the region is valid:
     ```bash
     aliyun ecs describe-regions --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-ecs-gpu-diagnosis
     ```
     - Extract the `Regions.Region[].RegionId` list from the response
     - Check if the provided `REGION_ID` exists in the list
     - If region is invalid, inform the user: "Invalid region ID. Please provide a valid region ID from the available regions list."

4. **Check Instance Operating System Type**
   - Before creating a diagnosis report, query instance information to confirm the OS type:
     ```bash
     aliyun ecs describe-instances  --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-ecs-gpu-diagnosis --RegionId ${REGION_ID} --InstanceIds '["${INSTANCE_ID}"]'
     ```
   - Extract the `Instances.Instance[0].OSType` field from the response
   - **If `OSType` is "linux"**: Continue with the subsequent diagnosis process
   - **If `OSType` is not "linux"**: Notify the user and terminate the process:
     ```
     The current instance ${INSTANCE_ID} has operating system ${OSType}.
     This Skill currently only supports Linux operating system instances, other operating systems are not supported.
     No further diagnosis process is needed.
     ```

### Execute Diagnosis

1. **Create Diagnostic Report**
   MUST Use the following command to initiate GPU diagnosis. Using alternatives such as RunCommand, nvidia-smi, DescribeInvocationResults, etc., for GPU diagnostics is prohibited.

   ```bash
   aliyun ecs create-diagnostic-report \
     --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-ecs-gpu-diagnosis \
     --RegionId '${REGION_ID}' \
     --ResourceId '${INSTANCE_ID}' \
     --MetricSetId 'dms-instanceGPUdevice' \
     --output cols=ReportId
   ```

   Extract `ReportId` from the output and save it for subsequent queries.

2. **Poll Diagnostic Results**

   MUST Use the following command to query the diagnosis report status:

   ```bash
   aliyun ecs describe-diagnostic-reports \
     --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-ecs-gpu-diagnosis \
     --RegionId '${REGION_ID}' \
     --ReportIds.1 '${REPORT_ID}'
   ```

   Handle based on the returned `Status` field:

   - **Status = "Finished"**: Diagnosis complete, parse the `Issues` field content
     - If `Issues` is empty or does not exist, report "GPU diagnosis normal, no anomalies detected"
     - If `Issues` contains content, extract each Issue's `IssueId`, `MetricId`, `Severity`, and `MetricCategory`, and output diagnosis results and recommended actions according to the IssueId mapping table below
   - **Status = "InProgress"**: Diagnosis in progress, wait 5 seconds before querying again
   - **Status = "Failed"**: Diagnosis failed, report the failure status to the user

   Set timeout mechanism: poll up to 60 times (approximately 5 minutes), if still not complete, prompt the user to query manually later.

### Output Description

After diagnosis is complete, the output should include:
- Instance ID and region
- Diagnostic report ID
- GPU device status summary
- Discovered Issues (if any)
- Recommended remediation measures (inferred from Issues content)

### Diagnostic Result Analysis

The `Issues` returned in the diagnosis report is an array, where each Issue contains `IssueId`, `MetricId`, `Severity`, and `MetricCategory` fields. Output diagnosis description and handling measures according to the IssueId mapping table below:

| IssueId | Diagnostic Description | Exception Handling Measures |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| GuestOS.GPU.MemoryEccCheckError | Detect GPU Double Bit Error conditions | Prompt user to restart instance based on error count |
| GuestOS.GPU.InfoRomCorrupted | Detect GPU infoROM firmware information | O&M notification will be sent to user |
| GuestOS.GPU.DriverVersionMismatch | Detect driver anomalies caused by Kernel upgrades | User needs to uninstall and reinstall driver |
| GuestOS.GPU.FabricmanagerCheck | Detect Fabricmanager component running status | User needs to install or start Fabricmanager component service |
| GuestOS.GPU.PowerCableError | Detect GPU power cable and power supply status | O&M notification will be sent to user |
| GuestOS.GPU.DeviceLost | Detect GPU card loss conditions | O&M notification will be sent to user |
| GuestOS.GPU.DriverNotInstalled | Detect GPU driver installation status | User needs to install driver |
| GuestOS.GPU.NVXidError | Detect GPU Xid error anomalies | Prompt user to restart instance based on different XID errors |
| GuestOS.GPU.RmInitAdapterError | Detect GPU card initialization anomalies, manifested as driver card loss | O&M notification will be sent to user |
| GuestOS.GPU.NVLinkError | Check GPU NVlink status | O&M notification will be sent to user |

**Output Format Example**:

```
Diagnosis Complete! Instance: i-bp1xxxxxxxxx (cn-shanghai)
Report ID: dr-xxxxxxxx

1 anomaly found:

[1] GuestOS.GPU.DriverNotInstalled
    Severity: Warn
    Diagnostic Description: Detect GPU driver installation status
    Handling Measures: User needs to install driver

Diagnostic Recommendations:
- Please install the corresponding version of NVIDIA GPU driver
- Installation Guide: https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/108460.html
```

**Special Reminder**: When the exception handling measure is "O&M notification will be sent to user", append the following reminder to the output:
```
⚠️ Important Reminder:
- Alibaba Cloud will send you O&M event notifications
- Please go to the ECS console to view event details
- Pay attention to whether you receive O&M events and handle them as required
```

If `Issues` is an empty array or does not exist, output:
```
Diagnosis Complete! Instance: i-bp1xxxxxxxxx (cn-shanghai)
Report ID: dr-xxxxxxxx

GPU diagnosis normal, no anomalies detected.
```

### Edge Case Handling

- **Instance does not exist**: CLI will return an error, capture and inform the user that the instance ID may be incorrect
- **Region error**: Prompt user to confirm the region where the instance is located
- **Non-GPU specification**: If the instance is not a GPU specification, diagnosis may have no results, prompt user to confirm instance type
- **Insufficient permissions**: If permission error is returned, prompt user to check AccessKey permissions
- **Network timeout**: Set command execution timeout (recommended 30 seconds), retry after timeout or prompt user to check network

### Example Workflow

```
User: Help me diagnose this GPU server i-bp1xxxxxxxxx

Agent:
1. Check CLI is installed
2. Ask for region (user did not provide)
3. User replies: cn-shanghai
4. Check instance OS type is Linux
5. Execute CreateDiagnosticReport, get ReportId: dr-xxxxxxxx
6. Poll DescribeDiagnosticReports
7. Status=InProgress, wait 5 seconds...
8. Query again, Status=Finished
9. Output Issues content to user
```
