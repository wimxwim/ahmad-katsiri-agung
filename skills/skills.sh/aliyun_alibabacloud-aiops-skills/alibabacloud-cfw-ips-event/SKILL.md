# IPS Alert Event Analysis

> **Skill Scope Notes:**
> - This skill is designed to use Aliyun CLI `cloudfw` commands as its primary data source.
> - It does not depend on local log files, SIEM exports, or direct host access.
> - It does not require SSH or direct connections to server IPs.
> - For IP-focused investigations, prefer `DescribeRiskEventGroup` with `--SrcIP` or `--DstIP`.

## Scenario Description

Query and analyze IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) security events and alerts detected by Alibaba Cloud Firewall, helping quickly locate threats and provide remediation recommendations.

**Architecture**: `Cloud Firewall Service → IPS Engine → Event Detection + Attack Analysis + Protection Configuration`

**Capability Level**: Query (read-only)

**Data Source**: All data is obtained **exclusively** through Aliyun CLI commands (`aliyun cloudfw ...`). No log files, no databases, no server access, no SIEM — just CLI commands. **Do NOT search the workspace for files. Do NOT ask the user for anything. Just run the commands.**

**Core Capabilities**:
1. **Alert Overview** — IPS alert statistics including attack counts, block counts, and severity distribution
2. **Alert Event Details** — Detailed list of IPS alert events with source/destination, attack type, and handling status
3. **Top Attacked Assets** — Ranking of most attacked assets
4. **Attack Type Analysis** — Distribution of attack types and applications
5. **IPS Configuration Status** — Current IPS run mode, rule switches, and rule library version
6. **Remediation Recommendations** — Prioritized security recommendations based on alert data

---

## Prerequisites

> **Pre-check: Aliyun CLI >= 3.3.3 required**
> Run `aliyun version` to verify >= 3.3.3. If not installed or version too low,
> run `curl -fsSL https://aliyuncli.alicdn.com/setup.sh | bash` to install/update,
> or see `references/cli-installation-guide.md` for installation instructions.

> **Pre-check: Aliyun CLI plugin update required**
> [MUST] run `aliyun configure set --auto-plugin-install true` to enable automatic plugin installation.
> [MUST] run `aliyun plugin update` to ensure that any existing plugins are always up-to-date.

**[MUST] CLI User-Agent** — Every `aliyun` CLI command invocation must include:
`--user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event`

At the **start** of the Core Workflow (before any CLI invocation):
**[MUST] Enable AI-Mode** — AI-mode is required for Agent Skill execution.
Run the following commands before any CLI invocation:
```bash
aliyun configure ai-mode enable
aliyun configure ai-mode set-user-agent --user-agent "AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event"
```
**[MUST] Disable AI-Mode at EVERY exit point** — Before delivering the final response for ANY reason, always disable AI-mode first. This applies to ALL exit paths: workflow success, workflow failure, error/exception, user cancellation, session end, or any other scenario where no further CLI commands will be executed.
AI-mode is only used for Agent Skill invocation scenarios and MUST NOT remain enabled after the skill stops running.
```bash
aliyun configure ai-mode disable
```

---

## Authentication

> **Pre-check: Alibaba Cloud Credentials Required**
>
> **Security Rules:**
> - **NEVER** read, echo, print, cat, or display AK/SK values under any circumstances
> - **NEVER** ask the user to input AK/SK directly in the conversation or command line
> - **NEVER** use `aliyun configure set` with literal credential values
> - **ONLY** use `aliyun configure list` to check credential status
>
> ```bash
> aliyun configure list
> ```
>
> Check the output for a valid profile (AK, STS, or OAuth identity).
>
> **If no valid profile exists, STOP here.**
> 1. Obtain credentials from [Alibaba Cloud Console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/manage/ak)
> 2. Configure credentials **outside of this session** (via `aliyun configure` in terminal or environment variables in shell profile)
> 3. Return and re-run after `aliyun configure list` shows a valid profile

---

## RAM Policy

> **[MUST] RAM Permission Pre-check:** Before executing any commands, verify the current user has the required permissions.
> 1. Use `ram-permission-diagnose` skill to get current user's permissions
> 2. Compare against `references/ram-policies.md`
> 3. Abort and prompt user if any permission is missing

Minimum required permissions — see [references/ram-policies.md](references/ram-policies.md) for full policy JSON.

Alternatively, attach the system policy: **AliyunYundunCloudFirewallReadOnlyAccess**

---

## Parameter Confirmation

> **IMPORTANT: Parameter Confirmation** — Before executing any command or API call,
> check if the user has already provided necessary parameters in their request.
> - If the user's request **explicitly mentions** a parameter value (e.g., "check IPS alerts for the last 7 days" means use 7-day time range), use that value directly **without asking for confirmation**.
> - For optional parameters with sensible defaults (PageSize, CurrentPage, time ranges), use the defaults without asking unless the user indicates otherwise.
> - Do NOT re-ask for parameters that the user has clearly stated.

| Parameter Name | Required/Optional | Description | Default Value |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| RegionId | Required | Alibaba Cloud region for Cloud Firewall. Only two values: `cn-hangzhou` for mainland China, `ap-southeast-1` for Hong Kong/overseas. | `cn-hangzhou` (use directly without asking; only use `ap-southeast-1` if user explicitly mentions Hong Kong/overseas/international) |
| StartTime | Required for most APIs | Start time for alert queries (Unix timestamp in seconds) | 24 hours ago for "today", 7 days ago for "recently"/"this week" (use without asking) |
| EndTime | Required for most APIs | End time for alert queries (Unix timestamp in seconds) | Current time (use without asking) |
| PageSize | Optional | Number of items per page for paginated APIs | 50 (use without asking) |
| CurrentPage | Optional | Page number for paginated APIs | 1 (use without asking) |

## Input Validation (MUST)

Treat all Agent-provided inputs as untrusted. Validate before building CLI commands.

Validation rules:
- `RegionId`: must be exactly one of `cn-hangzhou` or `ap-southeast-1`.
- `StartTime` / `EndTime`: must be 10-digit Unix seconds (`^[0-9]{10}$`), and `StartTime < EndTime`.
- `CurrentPage`: positive integer (`>=1`).
- `PageSize`: integer in range `1-100`.
- `SrcIP` / `DstIP`: must be valid IPv4 format only (`a.b.c.d`, each octet `0-255`).

Safe command construction rules:
- Never concatenate raw user text into shell commands.
- Only pass validated values into fixed CLI flag templates.
- If any validation fails, stop execution and return a clear validation error.

## Error Handling and Workflow Resilience

> **CRITICAL: Continue on failure.** If any individual API call fails, do NOT stop the entire workflow.
> Log the error for that step, then proceed to the next step. Present whatever data was successfully collected.

### Retry Logic

For each API call:
1. If the call fails with a **transient error** (network timeout, throttling `Throttling.User`, `ServiceUnavailable`, HTTP 500/502/503), retry up to **2 times** with a 3-second delay between retries.
2. If the call fails with a **permanent error** (e.g., `InvalidParameter`, `Forbidden`, `InvalidAccessKeyId`), do NOT retry. Record the error and move on.
3. After all retries are exhausted, record "[Step X] Failed: {error message}" and continue to the next step.

### Timeout Policy (MUST)

Before any API call, explicitly set CLI timeouts:

```bash
export ALIBABA_CLOUD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=10
export ALIBABA_CLOUD_READ_TIMEOUT=30
```

- `ALIBABA_CLOUD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=10`: fast fail for connect timeout.
- `ALIBABA_CLOUD_READ_TIMEOUT=30`: prevent long-running hangs per request.
- Timeout errors are treated as transient errors and follow retry logic.

### No Alert Events

If Step 1 (`DescribeRiskEventStatistic`) returns all zeros:
1. Inform the user: "No IPS alert events detected in the specified time range."
2. Still proceed with Step 6 and Step 7 to report IPS configuration status.

### Step Independence

The workflow steps have these dependencies:
- **Step 1 (Statistics)** should run first to provide context.
- **Steps 2-7 are independent of each other** — failure in any one step should NOT prevent other steps from executing.

### Partial Results

When presenting the final summary report:
- For steps that succeeded, show the collected data normally.
- For steps that failed, show "N/A (error: {brief error})" in the corresponding section.
- Always present the summary report even if some steps failed — partial data is better than no data.

---

## Core Workflow

All API calls use the Aliyun CLI `cloudfw` plugin.
Request/response schemas are maintained only in [references/api-analysis.md](references/api-analysis.md). Do not duplicate field-by-field descriptions in this file.

**User-Agent**: All commands must include `--user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event`
**Region**: Specified via `--region {RegionId}` global flag

> **CRITICAL: This skill is read-only (query only).** All commands below are safe, read-only queries that do not modify any cloud resources.
> Before executing, confirm the execution plan with the user: briefly list which steps will be executed and the target region. Proceed only after user confirmation.
> Do NOT ask the user which specific APIs to call or what data sources to use — those are determined by the workflow below.
> The intent routing table below is for **optimization only** — if the user's intent is unclear, plan to execute ALL steps (Step 1-7) by default.

### Intent Routing (Auto-determined, Confirm Before Execution)

Automatically determine execution scope based on user wording. Present the execution plan to the user for confirmation before running commands:

| User Intent | Execution Steps |
|-------------|----------------|
| Full alert analysis ("what IPS alerts today", "recent security events") | Execute all Steps 1-7 |
| Attacked asset investigation ("which assets were attacked most") | Execute Step 1 + Step 3 |
| Specific source IP alerts ("what alerts did this IP trigger") | Execute Step 2 (with `--SrcIP` filter) |
| Specific target asset/server alerts ("check attacks on x.x.x.x", "server 10.0.1.88 security alerts") | Execute Step 1 + Step 2 (with `--DstIP` filter) + Step 6 + Step 7 |
| Attack trend/types ("are attacks increasing recently") | Execute Step 1 + Step 4 + Step 5 |
| IPS configuration check ("what mode is IPS in", "rule library version") | Execute Step 6 + Step 7 |

**Default behavior**: If user intent cannot be clearly determined, plan to execute all Steps 1-7 and confirm with user before proceeding.

### Time Parameters

Some APIs require `StartTime` and `EndTime` parameters (Unix timestamp in seconds).

**How to get timestamps**: Run `date +%s` to get the current timestamp, `date -d '1 day ago' +%s` for 24 hours ago, `date -d '7 days ago' +%s` for 7 days ago. Then use the returned numeric values directly in CLI commands.

> **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use bash variable substitution like `$(date +%s)` inside CLI commands — some execution environments block `$(...)`. Instead, run `date` commands separately first, note the returned values, then use them as literal numbers in the `--StartTime` and `--EndTime` parameters.

Default time ranges:
- User says "today" → `StartTime` = 24 hours ago
- User says "recently"/"this week" → `StartTime` = 7 days ago
- No time range specified → default to 7 days ago
- `EndTime` → always current timestamp

### Step 1: IPS Alert Statistics Overview

Retrieve overall alert statistics to understand the current security posture.

```bash
aliyun cloudfw describe-risk-event-statistic \
  --StartTime {StartTime} \
  --EndTime {EndTime} \
  --region {RegionId} \
  --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event
```

### Step 2: IPS Alert Event Details

Retrieve grouped alert event list. This is the core data for analysis.

```bash
aliyun cloudfw describe-risk-event-group \
  --CurrentPage 1 \
  --PageSize 50 \
  --StartTime {StartTime} \
  --EndTime {EndTime} \
  --DataType 1 \
  --region {RegionId} \
  --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event
```

Optional filter parameters (auto-added based on user intent, no confirmation needed):
- By direction: `--Direction in` or `--Direction out`
- By source IP: `--SrcIP x.x.x.x` (query "attacks initiated by a specific IP")
- By target IP: `--DstIP x.x.x.x` (query "attacks on a specific server/IP", **supports private IPs like 10.x.x.x**)
- By vulnerability level: `--VulLevel 3` (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high)

> **Key**: When a user mentions a specific server or IP being attacked, use the `--DstIP` filter to query all attack records for that IP — no need to access the server itself.

Pagination: Check `TotalCount`. If it exceeds 50, increment `CurrentPage`.

### Step 3: Top Attacked Assets Ranking

Identify which assets are attack hotspots.

```bash
aliyun cloudfw describe-risk-event-top-attack-asset \
  --StartTime {StartTime} \
  --EndTime {EndTime} \
  --region {RegionId} \
  --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event
```

### Step 4: Top Attack Types Ranking

Understand the main threat types being faced.

```bash
aliyun cloudfw describe-risk-event-top-attack-type \
  --StartTime {StartTime} \
  --EndTime {EndTime} \
  --Direction in \
  --region {RegionId} \
  --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event
```

If outbound attack types are also needed, make another call with `--Direction out`.

Note: This API requires the `Direction` parameter, otherwise it will return an error.

### Step 5: Top Attacked Applications Ranking

Understand which application-layer targets are being attacked.

```bash
aliyun cloudfw describe-risk-event-top-attack-app \
  --StartTime {StartTime} \
  --EndTime {EndTime} \
  --region {RegionId} \
  --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event
```

### Step 6: IPS Protection Configuration Status

Check the current IPS run mode and protection capabilities.

```bash
aliyun cloudfw describe-default-ipsconfig \
  --region {RegionId} \
  --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event
```

### Step 7: IPS Rule Library Version

```bash
aliyun cloudfw describe-signature-lib-version \
  --region {RegionId} \
  --user-agent AlibabaCloud-Agent-Skills/alibabacloud-cfw-ips-event
```

## Analysis & Report

After collecting data, generate a report in the following structure. Center the analysis around alert events, covering three dimensions: "who is attacking", "what is being attacked", and "how effective is the response". Only show sections with actual data; if an API call failed, note it and continue.

### 1. IPS Alert Posture Overview

Combine Step 1 statistics and Step 6 IPS configuration to display the current security posture:

**Alert Statistics (Time Range: x):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Attack Events | x |
| Blocked | x |
| Observed/Alerted | x |
| Untreated | x |
| High / Medium / Low Severity | x / x / x |

**IPS Configuration Status:**

| Configuration Item | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Run Mode | Observe/Block |
| Basic Protection | Enabled/Disabled |
| Virtual Patches | Enabled/Disabled |
| Threat Intelligence | Enabled/Disabled |
| AI Engine | Enabled/Disabled |
| Rule Library Version | x (update time) |

If IPS is in observe mode and there are high-severity events, prominently flag: "IPS is currently in observe mode — high-severity attacks are NOT being blocked".

### 2. High-Severity Alert Events (Immediate Action Required)

From Step 2, filter events with VulLevel=3 (high) or VulLevel=2 (medium with high event count), sorted by event count in descending order:

| Event Name | Attack Type | Source IP | Source Location | Target IP | Target Asset | Event Count | Handling Status | First Seen | Last Seen |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------------|-----------|----------|

Handling status explanation:
- **Observed** (RuleResult=1): IPS detected but did not block — requires manual confirmation on whether blocking is needed
- **Blocked** (RuleResult=2): Automatically blocked by IPS

### 3. Attack Hotspot Analysis

#### Top Attacked Assets

Combine Step 3 data to display attack status by asset:

| Rank | Target IP | Resource Name | Resource Type | Region | Attack Count | Blocked | Block Rate |
|------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------|-------------|---------|------------|

Focus on assets with low block rates — this means many attacks are only being observed, not blocked.

#### Attack Type Distribution

Combine Step 4 data:

| Attack Type | Attack Count | Blocked | Block Rate |
|------------|-------------|---------|------------|

#### Attack Application Distribution

Combine Step 5 data:

| Application | Attack Count | Blocked | Block Rate |
|------------|-------------|---------|------------|

### 4. Attack Source Analysis

Summarize source IP dimensions from Step 2 event data:

| Source IP | Source Country/City | Attack Count | Primary Attack Type | Target Asset Count | Handling Status |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|

Flag cases where the same source IP attacks multiple assets — this typically indicates organized scanning or attacks.

### 5. Remediation Recommendations

Generate specific recommendations based on actual data, sorted by priority. Each recommendation includes: **Risk Description**, **Impact Scope**, **Recommended Action**.

#### P0 — Critical (Immediate Action)
- High-severity events in "observe" mode, not blocked → Switch IPS to block mode, or manually block the attacking source IP
- Same source IP attacking multiple assets in volume → Add that IP to Cloud Firewall ACL blacklist
- IPS in observe mode with active high-severity attacks → Switch to block mode

#### P1 — High (Within 24 Hours)
- Medium-severity events recurring and not blocked → Check target asset vulnerabilities and remediate
- Basic protection/virtual patches not enabled → Recommend enabling to enhance protection
- Attacked assets with low block rate → Check IPS rule coverage

#### P2 — Medium (This Week)
- Multiple attack types targeting the same asset → Conduct security hardening review for that asset
- Threat intelligence/AI engine rules not enabled → Recommend enabling
- Rule library version outdated → Update to the latest version

#### P3 — Low (Periodic Review)
- Low-severity events persisting → Include in periodic review, assess whether they are false positives
- Optimize IPS whitelist to reduce business false positives

> **Note**: For any step that failed, show "N/A (error: {brief error})" for that section's data fields, and list all errors in the bottom section.

## API and Command Tables

Use [references/related-apis.md](references/related-apis.md) as the single source of truth for API tables and command mappings.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Query in order** — Start with alert statistics (Step 1) to understand the overall security posture. If all values are zero, report that no alerts were detected in the time range.
2. **Continue on failure** — If any step (2-7) fails, log the error and continue with the remaining steps. Always produce a report with whatever data was collected.
3. **Use pagination** — For alert event lists (Step 2), use `CurrentPage` and `PageSize`. Default to PageSize=50. If `TotalCount` exceeds `PageSize`, iterate through all pages.
4. **Time range selection** — Default to last 24 hours for "today", last 7 days for "recently"/"this week". Use Unix timestamps in seconds. Calculate with: `date +%s` for current time, `date -d '1 day ago' +%s` for 24 hours ago, `date -d '7 days ago' +%s` for 7 days ago. Run these commands separately, then use the returned values as literal numbers in `--StartTime` and `--EndTime`. Do NOT use `$(...)` substitution inside CLI commands.
5. **Region awareness** — Cloud Firewall only has two regions: `cn-hangzhou` (mainland China) and `ap-southeast-1` (Hong Kong/overseas). Default to `cn-hangzhou` unless user specifies otherwise.
6. **Direction parameter** — Step 4 (`DescribeRiskEventTopAttackType`) requires the `Direction` parameter. Default to `in` (inbound). Query `out` separately if needed.
7. **Rate limiting** — Space API calls to avoid throttling. If you receive a `Throttling.User` error, wait 3 seconds and retry.
8. **Security** — NEVER expose, log, echo, or display AK/SK values.
9. **Retry on transient errors** — For network timeouts or 5xx errors, retry up to 2 times with a 3-second delay.
10. **Validate all inputs first** — Reject invalid `RegionId`, timestamp, pagination, and IP values before command execution.
11. **Set explicit timeout env vars** — Always set `ALIBABA_CLOUD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=10` and `ALIBABA_CLOUD_READ_TIMEOUT=30` before workflow commands.
