# Three.js Performance Optimization

Performance patterns for Three.js games, backed by measured before/after numbers on Three.js r183 (headless Chromium via Playwright, Apple M1 Pro, software WebGL).

## Reference Files

- `instancing-static.md` — InstancedMesh for large static repeated objects (19,600 → 1 draw call)
- `instancing-moving.md` — Flat state buffer + batched InstancedMesh writes for moving entities (8,000 entities)
- `templates/` — Baseline vs optimized reference implementations for each pattern

## When to Use This Skill

- Scene has 100+ repeated objects sharing geometry/material
- Draw calls exceed 500 and frame time is unstable
- Thousands of moving entities need per-frame transform updates
- Profile shows scene-graph traversal as a bottleneck

## When NOT to Use

- Object count is low (<50 unique meshes) — simpler code wins
- Every object needs unique materials/shaders that defeat batching
- Geometry differs enough that instancing provides no batching benefit

## Pattern 1: Instancing Large Static Object Sets

**Problem**: Forests, debris, decorations as individual Meshes = unnecessary draw calls.

**Solution**: One `InstancedMesh` per shared geometry+material combo.

**Evidence**: ~19,365 → 2 draw calls. Render CPU p95: 28.5ms → 0.5ms (~57× faster). Build: 39.4ms → 3.9ms. See `instancing-static.md`.

```js
// Anti-pattern: one Mesh per prop
for (let i = 0; i < 19600; i++) {
  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  mesh.position.set(x, 0, z);
  scene.add(mesh); // 19,600 draw calls
}

// Correct: one InstancedMesh
const im = new THREE.InstancedMesh(geometry, material, 19600);
const mat = new THREE.Matrix4();
for (let i = 0; i < 19600; i++) {
  mat.makeTranslation(x, 0, z);
  im.setMatrixAt(i, mat);
}
im.instanceMatrix.needsUpdate = true;
scene.add(im); // 1 draw call
```

## Pattern 2: Moving Entity Update Loops

**Problem**: Thousands of moving actors as individual Meshes = scene-graph churn + transform propagation.

**Solution**: Flat entity state buffer + batched `InstancedMesh.setMatrixAt()` writes.

**Evidence**: 8,000 → 1 draw calls. Render CPU p95: 9.9ms → 0.5ms (~20× faster). Update loop p95: 1.4ms → 0.3ms. See `instancing-moving.md`.

```js
// Anti-pattern: per-entity Mesh position writes
meshes.forEach((mesh, i) => {
  mesh.position.x = computeX(i, tick);
  mesh.position.y = computeY(i, tick);
});

// Correct: batched instance matrix writes
const mat = new THREE.Matrix4();
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  mat.makeTranslation(computeX(i, tick), computeY(i, tick), computeZ(i, tick));
  instancedMesh.setMatrixAt(i, mat);
}
instancedMesh.instanceMatrix.needsUpdate = true;
```

## Decision Tree

```
Is the object repeated 50+ times with same geometry+material?
├── YES → Is it static (no per-frame movement)?
│   ├── YES → Pattern 1: Static InstancedMesh (instancing-static.md)
│   └── NO  → Pattern 2: Moving InstancedMesh with batched writes (instancing-moving.md)
└── NO  → Standard Mesh is fine. Focus on material/geometry reuse.
```

## Measured Results

Headless Chromium 147 via Playwright, Three.js r183, Apple M1 Pro, 30 warmup + 180 sample frames, median of 3 runs.

| Scenario | Metric | Baseline | Optimized | Improvement |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Static World (19.6k cubes) | Draw calls | ~19,365 | 2 | ~9,682× |
| Static World (19.6k cubes) | Render CPU p95 | 28.5ms | 0.5ms | ~57× |
| Static World (19.6k cubes) | Build | 39.4ms | 3.9ms | ~10× |
| Moving Entities (8k wave-field) | Draw calls | 8,000 | 1 | 8,000× |
| Moving Entities (8k wave-field) | Render CPU p95 | 9.9ms | 0.5ms | ~20× |
| Moving Entities (8k wave-field) | Update loop p95 | 1.4ms | 0.3ms | ~4.7× |

### Methodology notes

- **CPU-side metrics are the trustworthy signal.** Draw calls, render CPU p95, update loop, and build time reliably show the 1–2 order-of-magnitude win.
- **FPS and frame-time p95 are unreliable in headless Chromium.** Playwright's bundled Chromium uses SwiftShader (software WebGL), which bottlenecks on fragment shading of ~90 MB of visible geometry regardless of draw-call count. On real hardware WebGL, the FPS gap would be substantially larger — baseline would drop to single-digit FPS under real fill, and optimized would hit vsync cleanly.
- **A benchmark passes** if draw calls decreased and render CPU p95 did not regress.
