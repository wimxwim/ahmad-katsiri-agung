# dt-alerting

Configure and understand the full alerting lifecycle in Dynatrace — from anomaly
detector setup through Grail event storage, problem grouping, and workflow
notification delivery.

## The Alerting Lifecycle

## When to Use This Skill

- **Detector setup** — "How do I create an anomaly detector?", "What kind of
  detector should I use?", "What is the difference between adaptive and seasonal?"
- **Alert event history** — "Query all alert events for this service", "Show me
  which metrics triggered alerts last week"
- **Problem denoising** — "Why did these two alerts merge into one problem?",
  "How does Davis group alerts?"
- **Notification setup** — "How do I send a Slack message when a problem opens?",
  "Set up a ServiceNow ticket on critical problems"
- **Best practices** — "How do I avoid alert storms?", "Which sensitivity setting
  should I use?"
- **Over-alerting analysis** — "Why am I getting too many alerts?", "How do I
  reduce alert fatigue?", "Which detector is firing the most?", "How do I tune
  sensitivity or thresholds to avoid noise?"
- **Notification routing** — "How do I route alerts to the right team?", "Set up
  scalable problem filters in workflows", "Send Slack notifications only to the
  team responsible for the affected service"

## Agent Instructions

**First step for any alerting setup request** — Before recommending a specific
detector or model, load `references/anomaly-detectors.md` and use its category
and model decision guide to identify which detector category (DQL-based, Edge,
Pipeline, Synthetic, External) and which model (Static, Adaptive, Seasonal)
best fits the user's use-case. Only proceed with configuration guidance once
the right detector type has been established.

**Consolidate, don't multiply** — When a user asks to alert on multiple
entities of the same kind (e.g. "alert on services A, B, and C"), always
recommend a **single combined detector** rather than one detector per entity.
Use `by: { <dimension> }` in the DQL `timeseries` call to split results per
entity, and a single `filter:` clause to scope to the relevant entities.
Pair the combined detector with a **single `dt.alert_group` tag** shared
across all alert conditions and the corresponding workflow notification filter.
This keeps the number of detector configs small, ensures consistent routing,
and makes the workflow notification channel reusable for future entities added
to the same group.

Example for three services — one detector, one workflow:

```dql
timeseries avg(dt.service.request.response_time),
  by: { dt.smartscape.service },
  filter: { in(dt.smartscape.service, {toSmartscapeId("SERVICE-0000000000000001"), toSmartscapeId("SERVICE-0000000000000002"), toSmartscapeId("SERVICE-0000000000000003")}) }
```

Set `dt.alert_group: "checkout-team"` in the detector's event properties, then
filter the notification workflow on `matchesPhrase(dt.alert_group, "checkout-team")`.
If a new service must be covered, add it to the single `filter:` list — no new
detector or workflow rule needed.

> **Analyzing existing problems** — If the user wants to query or investigate
> active/closed problems (root cause, impact, trending), load `dt-obs-problems`
> instead. This skill covers *configuration and flow*, not problem query analytics.

> **Detector health monitoring** — If the user asks whether detectors are

> ANOMALY_DETECTOR_STATUS_EVENT). This skill covers *setup*, not operational health.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Dynatrace environment with Settings v2 write permissions for
  detector configuration
- For querying alert history: DQL permissions on `dt.davis.events`
- Load `dt-dql-essentials` before writing DQL queries

## Knowledge Base Structure

| # | Reference | Content |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | [anomaly-detectors.md](references/anomaly-detectors.md) | Detector types, model selection, configuration, best practices |
| 2 | [davis-events.md](references/davis-events.md) | Davis event storage in Grail, key fields, DQL query patterns |
| 3 | [workflow-notifications.md](references/workflow-notifications.md) | Problem-triggered workflows, filtering, notification channels |

## Key Concepts

### Alert Source Categories

Five fundamental categories of anomaly detectors, distinguished by where detection
runs and how the alert event reaches Dynatrace:

| # | Category | Detection runs on | Latency | Alert logic owner |
|---|----------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **DQL-based** | Grail (server-side, scheduled) | Minutes | Dynatrace |
| 2 | **Edge** | OneAgent on the monitored host/process | Seconds | Dynatrace (OneAgent) |
| 3 | **Pipeline** | OpenPipeline ingest path (in-stream) | Near-zero | Dynatrace (pipeline rule) |
| 4 | **Synthetic** | Synthetic checker node (worldwide) | Seconds | Dynatrace (synthetic node) |
| 5 | **External** | Customer / external tool | Caller-defined | Customer |

See `references/anomaly-detectors.md` for the full breakdown of each category,
including trade-offs and configuration entry points.

### Detector Models at a Glance

| Model | Threshold | Best for |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Static** | Fixed value you define | Known hard limits (e.g. error rate > 5%) |
| **Adaptive baseline** | Learned from recent history | Metrics with no fixed limit but clear normal behavior |
| **Seasonal baseline** | Learned with time-of-day / day-of-week awareness | Traffic, request rate, or any metric with recurring patterns |

### Davis Events vs. Problems

| Concept | Table | Scope |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Davis event** | `fetch dt.davis.events` | One record per detector trigger per entity |
| **Problem** | `fetch dt.davis.problems` | One record per correlated group of events sharing root-cause and impact |

A single problem typically contains multiple events. Querying problems gives
the operational view; querying events gives the raw alert history.

### Problem Denoising

For questions about why alerts merged into a problem or how Davis groups
events, load `dt-obs-problems` — the merge logic and rules are documented in
`dt-obs-problems/references/problem-merging.md`. This skill covers alert
*configuration and flow* only.

## Quick Start

### Check What Alerts Fired in the Last 24 Hours

```dql
fetch dt.davis.events, from: -24h
| filter event.status == "ACTIVE"
| summarize alert_count = count(), by: {event.name, event.category, dt.smartscape_source.id}
| sort alert_count desc
| limit 20
```

### Check Alert Volume by Category

```dql
fetch dt.davis.events, from: -24h
| summarize count = count(), by: {event.category, event.status}
| sort count desc
```

### See All Active Problems (→ load dt-obs-problems for full query patterns)

```dql
fetch dt.davis.problems, from: -24h
| filter not(dt.davis.is_duplicate) and event.status == "ACTIVE"
| fields event.start, display_id, event.name, event.category
| sort event.start desc
| limit 20
```

## Best Practices

1. **Match the model to the metric's behavior** — Use static for hard SLO
   boundaries, adaptive for metrics without a natural fixed limit, seasonal for
   anything that follows business hours or weekly patterns.
2. **Scope detectors narrowly** — An entity selector that covers only relevant
   entities reduces noise and makes problems more actionable.
3. **Tune sensitivity before going to production** — Start with LOW sensitivity
   and move to MEDIUM or HIGH only after observing false-positive rates.
4. **Let Davis denoise before notifying** — Trigger workflow notifications on
   *problems*, not individual alert events. A problem groups correlated alerts
   so you notify once per incident, not once per metric.
5. **Filter notifications by severity level** — Route `event.severity <= 2` problems to
   on-call channels immediately; route `event.severity >= 3` problems to lower-
   urgency channels. Either set severity in the detector config or assign in a pipeline rule or workflow.
6. **Use `dt.alert_group` event property for routing** — Assign `dt.alert_group` to route alerts to the right team. Either set a static value in the detector config, use dynamic assignment through DQL query result mapping or assign in a pipeline rule.
7. **Combine same-condition alerts into one detector and one workflow** — When
   alerting on multiple entities with the same metric and threshold, merge them
   into a single DQL-based detector using `by: { <dimension> }` and a combined
   `filter:` clause. Assign the same `dt.alert_group` value to every condition
   in that detector and point the workflow notification channel at that single
   group. One detector + one workflow per logical alert group scales better than
   N detectors + N notification rules, and adding a new entity is a one-line
   filter change rather than a full detector/workflow addition.
