# Infrastructure Hosts Skill

Monitor and manage host and process infrastructure including CPU, memory, disk, network, and technology inventory.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user needs to:

- **Inventory:** "Show me all Linux hosts in AWS us-east-1"
- **Monitor:** "What hosts have high CPU usage?"
- **Troubleshoot:** "Which processes are consuming the most memory?"
- **Discover:** "What databases are running in production?"
- **Plan:** "Track Kubernetes version distribution for upgrade planning"
- **Cost:** "Calculate infrastructure costs by cost center"
- **Security:** "Find all processes listening on port 22"
- **Compliance:** "Identify hosts running EOL Java versions"
- **Quality:** "Check data completeness for AWS hosts"
- **Optimize:** "Find rightsizing candidates based on utilization"

---
> **Cross-source join required:** If the query must combine host data with logs or other
> telemetry sources (e.g. "show logs from Linux hosts with their IP addresses") → also read
> `dt-dql-essentials/references/smartscape-topology-navigation.md` before writing the query.
---

## Core Concepts

### Entities
- **HOST** - Physical or virtual machines (cloud or on-premise)
- **PROCESS** - Running processes and process groups
- **CONTAINER** - Kubernetes containers
- **NETWORK_INTERFACE** - Host network interfaces
- **DISK** - Host disk volumes

### Metrics Categories
1. **Host Metrics** - `dt.host.cpu.*`, `dt.host.memory.*`, `dt.host.disk.*`, `dt.host.net.*`
2. **Process Metrics** - `dt.process.cpu.*`, `dt.process.memory.*`, `dt.process.io.*`, `dt.process.network.*`
3. **Inventory** - OS type, cloud provider, technology stack, versions
4. **Cost** - `dt.cost.costcenter`, `dt.cost.product`
5. **Quality** - Metadata completeness, version compliance

### Alert Thresholds
- **CPU/Memory/Disk:** 80% warning, 90% critical
- **Network:** >70% high, >85% saturated
- **Disk Latency:** >20ms bottleneck
- **Network Errors:** Drop rate >1%, error rate >0.1%
- **Swap:** >30% warning, >50% critical

## Key Workflows

### 1. Host Discovery and Classification

Discover hosts, classify by OS/cloud, inventory resources.

```dql
smartscapeNodes "HOST"
| fieldsAdd os.type, cloud.provider, host.logical.cpu.cores, host.physical.memory
| summarize host_count = count(), by: {os.type, cloud.provider}
| sort host_count desc
```

**OS Types:** `LINUX`, `WINDOWS`, `AIX`, `SOLARIS`, `ZOS`

→ For cloud-specific attributes, see [references/inventory-discovery.md](#cloud-specific-attributes)

### 2. Resource Utilization Monitoring

Monitor CPU, memory, disk, network across hosts.

```dql
timeseries {
  cpu = avg(dt.host.cpu.usage),
  memory = avg(dt.host.memory.usage),
  disk = avg(dt.host.disk.used.percent)
}, by: {dt.smartscape.host}
| fieldsAdd host_name = getNodeName(dt.smartscape.host)
| filter arrayAvg(cpu) > 80 or arrayAvg(memory) > 80
| sort arrayAvg(cpu) desc
```

**High utilization threshold:** 80% warning, 90% critical

**Key CPU Metrics:**
- `dt.host.cpu.usage` — Total CPU utilization (0-100%)
- `dt.host.cpu.idle` — CPU idle time (inverse of usage; useful for anomaly detection)
- `dt.host.cpu.user` — CPU time in user mode
- `dt.host.cpu.system` — CPU time in kernel mode
- `dt.host.cpu.iowait` — CPU waiting for I/O (Linux only)

→ For detailed CPU analysis, see [references/host-metrics.md](references/host-metrics.md#cpu-monitoring)  
→ For memory breakdown, see [references/host-metrics.md](references/host-metrics.md#memory-monitoring)

#### Disk Free Space — Find Hosts with Most/Least Free Disk

```dql
timeseries disk_used_pct = avg(dt.host.disk.used.percent), by: {dt.smartscape.host}
| fieldsAdd host_name = getNodeName(dt.smartscape.host)
| fieldsAdd avg_disk_used = arrayAvg(disk_used_pct),
    free_pct = 100 - arrayAvg(disk_used_pct)
| sort free_pct desc
| limit 10
```

### 3. Process Resource Analysis

Identify top resource consumers at process level.

```dql
timeseries {
  cpu = avg(dt.process.cpu.usage),
  memory = avg(dt.process.memory.usage)
}, by: {dt.smartscape.process}
| fieldsAdd process_name = getNodeName(dt.smartscape.process)
| filter arrayAvg(cpu) > 50
| sort arrayAvg(cpu) desc
| limit 20
```

→ For process I/O analysis, see [references/process-monitoring.md](references/process-monitoring.md#process-io)  
→ For process network metrics, see [references/process-monitoring.md](references/process-monitoring.md#process-network)

### 4. Technology Stack Inventory

Discover and track software technologies and versions.

```dql
smartscapeNodes "PROCESS"
| fieldsAdd process.software_technologies
| expand tech = process.software_technologies
| fieldsAdd tech_type = tech[type], tech_version = tech[version]
| summarize process_count = count(), by: {tech_type, tech_version}
| sort process_count desc
```

**Common Technologies:** Java, Node.js, Python, .NET, databases, web servers, messaging systems

→ For version compliance checks, see [references/inventory-discovery.md](references/inventory-discovery.md#technology-inventory)

### 5. Service Discovery via Ports

Map listening ports to services for security and inventory.

```dql
smartscapeNodes "PROCESS"
| fieldsAdd process.listen_ports, dt.process_group.detected_name
| filter isNotNull(process.listen_ports) and arraySize(process.listen_ports) > 0
| expand listen_port = process.listen_ports
| summarize process_count = count(), by: {listen_port, dt.process_group.detected_name}
| sort toLong(listen_port) asc
| limit 50
```

**Well-known ports:** 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH), 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL)

→ For comprehensive port mapping, see [references/inventory-discovery.md](references/inventory-discovery.md#port-discovery)

### 6. Container and Kubernetes Monitoring

Track container distribution and K8s workload types.

```dql
smartscapeNodes "CONTAINER"
| fieldsAdd k8s.cluster.name, k8s.namespace.name, k8s.workload.kind
| summarize container_count = count(), by: {k8s.cluster.name, k8s.workload.kind}
| sort k8s.cluster.name, container_count desc
```

**Workload Types:** `deployment`, `daemonset`, `statefulset`, `job`, `cronjob`

**Note:** Container image names/versions NOT available in smartscape.

→ For K8s version tracking, see [references/container-monitoring.md](references/container-monitoring.md#kubernetes-versions)  
→ For container lifecycle, see [references/container-monitoring.md](references/container-monitoring.md#container-inventory)

### 7. Cost Attribution and Chargeback

Calculate infrastructure costs by cost center.

```dql
smartscapeNodes "HOST"
| fieldsAdd dt.cost.costcenter, host.logical.cpu.cores, host.physical.memory
| filter isNotNull(dt.cost.costcenter)
| fieldsAdd memory_gb = toDouble(host.physical.memory) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024
| summarize 
    host_count = count(),
    total_cores = sum(toLong(host.logical.cpu.cores)),
    total_memory_gb = sum(memory_gb),
    by: {dt.cost.costcenter}
| sort total_cores desc
```

→ For product-level cost tracking, see [references/inventory-discovery.md](references/inventory-discovery.md#cost-attribution)

### 8. Infrastructure Health Correlation

Correlate host and process metrics for cross-layer analysis.

```dql
timeseries {
  host_cpu = avg(dt.host.cpu.usage),
  host_memory = avg(dt.host.memory.usage),
  process_cpu = avg(dt.process.cpu.usage)
}, by: {dt.smartscape.host, dt.smartscape.process}
| fieldsAdd
    host_name = getNodeName(dt.smartscape.host),
    process_name = getNodeName(dt.smartscape.process)
| filter arrayAvg(host_cpu) > 70
| sort arrayAvg(host_cpu) desc
```

**Health scoring:** Critical if any resource >90%, warning if >80%

## Response Construction

When the user asks for data retrieval or a DQL query (e.g., "show me top hosts by
CPU"), **include the DQL query in the response** alongside the results. Users want to
see and reuse the query — it is the deliverable, not just a means to get results.

When the user asks for analysis (anomaly detection, forecasting, seasonality), the
analysis results are the deliverable. Focus on presenting findings clearly:
- **Prioritize metric-level findings** over data collection artifacts. If an analysis
  tool reports data gaps alongside actual anomalies, lead with the metric behavior
  the user asked about and mention gaps only as supplementary context.
- **Include host names** (not just IDs) using `getNodeName(dt.smartscape.host)` or the
  `get-entity-name` tool.
- **State the timeframe** analyzed and the tools/parameters used.

---

## Analytical Workflows

Host metric queries often serve as inputs to analytical tools (anomaly detection,
forecasting, seasonality analysis). This skill helps construct the right DQL query;
the actual analysis is performed by dedicated tools.

### Anomaly Detection and Pattern Analysis

When users ask about "unusual behavior", "anomalies", "spikes", or "sudden changes"
in host metrics, the workflow is:

1. **Construct the timeseries query** using this skill's patterns
2. **Pass it to the appropriate analysis tool** (anomaly detector, novelty detection)

**Choosing between detectors:**
- **`adaptive-anomaly-detector`** — use when the user asks about *magnitude*: "spikes",
  "abrupt changes", "values that went above normal", "sudden jumps". It answers "did this
  metric cross an unexpected threshold?" and reports alert durations and peak values.
- **`timeseries-novelty-detection`** — use when the user asks about *behavioral change*:
  "unusual patterns", "something changed", "trends", "new behavior". It answers "did the
  shape of the signal change?" without implying a specific threshold was crossed.

**Response format for anomaly results:** Include both the host **name** (resolved via
`getNodeName(dt.smartscape.host)` or `get-entity-name`) and the host **entity ID** alongside timestamps and values.
Entity IDs alone are opaque to users; names alone prevent follow-up queries.

**Novelty type selection rule:** When using novelty detection, set
`analysisNoveltyType` to only `[SPIKE, CHANGE_IN_VALUES, TREND_IN_VALUES]` by default.
**EXCLUDE** `GAP_WITH_MISSING_VALUES` and `CHANGE_IN_MISSING_VALUES` unless the user
explicitly asks about data gaps or monitoring coverage. Data gaps are infrastructure
issues, not metric behavior anomalies — reporting them when the user asks about CPU
or memory patterns is incorrect.

Queries for analysis tools should use simple `timeseries` format with a single
aggregated metric and appropriate time range:

```dql
timeseries avg(dt.host.cpu.idle), by: {dt.smartscape.host}
```

```dql
timeseries avg(dt.host.memory.usage), by: {dt.smartscape.host}
```

Avoid adding filters or field transformations that reduce the data — the analysis
tools work best with complete timeseries data.


### Forecasting

When users ask to "predict", "forecast", or "estimate future" host metrics:

1. **Construct the timeseries query** with sufficient historical data (e.g., 7d for
   short-term, 30d for longer predictions)
2. **Pass to the forecasting tool** with the desired forecast horizon

The **forecast horizon** (how far ahead to predict) and the **historical window** (how much
past data the model trains on) are independent. A request like "forecast the next 2 hours"
sets the horizon to 2h — it says nothing about the lookback. Always use at least 7 days of
historical data regardless of how short the forecast horizon is. Too few training data points
cause the forecast model to fail and fall back to raw historical values.

```dql
timeseries avg(dt.host.cpu.usage), by: {dt.smartscape.host}
```

### Seasonality Detection

When users ask about "seasonality", "weekly patterns", or "recurring behavior":

1. **Use a longer time range** (at least 14d for weekly, 30d+ for monthly)
2. **Pass to the seasonal baseline anomaly detector**

**Response format for seasonal analysis:** When presenting results, include:
- Whether seasonal anomalies were detected (yes/no)
- The analysis timeframe and parameters used
- For each affected host: host name (not just ID), timestamps of violations, violation
  counts, baseline values vs actual values, and upper/lower bounds
- Organize results by host if multiple hosts are involved

### Scope Boundary — Service-Level vs Host-Level Metrics

This skill covers **host and process infrastructure metrics only**. If the user asks
about service-level metrics (request rate, response time, error rate, service calls per
minute, throughput), use `dt-obs-services` instead — even when the question involves
forecasting or anomaly detection of those metrics.

**Redirect these to `dt-obs-services`:** "service calls per minute", "request rate",
"response time by service", "error rate by endpoint", "service throughput forecast".

## Common Query Patterns

### Pattern 1: Smartscape Discovery
Use `smartscapeNodes` to discover and classify entities.
```dql-template
smartscapeNodes "HOST"
| fieldsAdd <attributes>
| filter <conditions>
| summarize <aggregations>
```

### Pattern 2: Timeseries Performance
Use `timeseries` to analyze metrics over time.
```dql-template
timeseries metric = avg(dt.host.<metric>), by: {dt.smartscape.host}
| fieldsAdd <calculations>
| filter <thresholds>
```

### Pattern 3: Cross-Layer Correlation
Correlate host and process metrics.
```dql
timeseries {
  host_cpu = avg(dt.host.cpu.usage),
  process_cpu = avg(dt.process.cpu.usage)
}, by: {dt.smartscape.host, dt.smartscape.process}
```

### Pattern 4: Entity Enrichment with Lookup
Enrich data with entity attributes. After `lookup`, reference fields with `lookup.` prefix.
```dql
timeseries cpu = avg(dt.host.cpu.usage), by: {dt.smartscape.host}
| lookup [
    smartscapeNodes HOST
    | fields id, cpuCores, memoryTotal
  ], sourceField:dt.smartscape.host, lookupField:id
| fieldsAdd cores = lookup.cpuCores, mem_gb = lookup.memoryTotal / 1024 / 1024 / 1024
```

## Tags and Metadata

### Important Notes
- Generic `tags` field is NOT populated in smartscape queries
- Use specific tag fields: `tags:azure[*]`, `tags:environment`
- Use custom metadata: `host.custom.metadata[*]`

### Available Tags
- **Azure Tags:** `tags:azure[dt_owner_team]`, `tags:azure[dt_cloudcost_capability]`
- **Environment:** `tags:environment`
- **Custom Metadata:** `host.custom.metadata[OperatorVersion]`, `host.custom.metadata[Cluster]`
- **Cost:** `dt.cost.costcenter`, `dt.cost.product`

→ For complete tag reference, see [references/inventory-discovery.md](#tags-and-metadata)

---

## Cloud-Specific Attributes

### AWS
- `cloud.provider == "aws"`
- `aws.region`, `aws.availability_zone`, `aws.account.id`
- `aws.resource.id`, `aws.resource.name`
- `aws.state` (running, stopped, terminated)

### Azure
- `cloud.provider == "azure"`
- `azure.location`, `azure.subscription`, `azure.resource.group`
- `azure.status`, `azure.provisioning_state`
- `azure.resource.sku.name` (VM size)

### Kubernetes
- `k8s.cluster.name`, `k8s.cluster.uid`
- `k8s.namespace.name`, `k8s.node.name`, `k8s.pod.name`
- `k8s.workload.name`, `k8s.workload.kind`

→ For multi-cloud analysis, see [references/inventory-discovery.md](references/inventory-discovery.md#multi-cloud-hosts)

---

## Best Practices

1. Use percentiles (p95, p99) for latency; `max()` for limits; `avg()` for trends
2. Set multi-level thresholds (warning 80%, critical 90%)
3. Filter early in the pipeline; limit results with `| limit N`
4. Aggregate before enrichment (lookup)
5. Use `getNodeName(dt.smartscape.host)` for human-readable host names; `getNodeName(dt.smartscape.process)` for processes
6. Convert bytes to GB: `/ 1024 / 1024 / 1024`; round with `round(value, decimals: 1)`

**Time windows:** Real-time: 5-15 min | Trends: 1-7 days | Capacity planning: 30-90 days

### Limitations
- `dt.host.cpu.iowait` available on Linux only
- Generic `tags` field NOT populated in smartscape (use specific tag namespaces)
- Container image names NOT available in smartscape

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| No hosts returned from `smartscapeNodes "HOST"` | Missing time range or OneAgent not deployed | Verify OneAgent is installed; add a time range to the query |
| `tags` field always empty | Generic `tags` not populated in smartscape | Use specific tag namespaces: `tags:azure[*]`, `tags:environment`, `dt.cost.costcenter` |
| Memory values in bytes are unreadable | Raw metric unit is bytes | Divide by `1024 / 1024 / 1024` and use `round(value, decimals: 1)` |
| `dt.host.cpu.iowait` returns no data | Metric is Linux-only | Check `os.type`; iowait is unavailable on Windows, AIX, Solaris |
| Container image names missing | Not available in smartscape | Use `k8s.object` parsing for image details; see dt-obs-kubernetes skill |
| `process.software_technologies` is empty | Process not monitored by deep injection | Verify OneAgent deep monitoring is enabled for the process group |
