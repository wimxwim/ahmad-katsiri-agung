# OKX Growth Competition — Trading Competition

Agentic Wallet exclusive trading competitions. Full lifecycle split across focused references:

- **Participation** (discover / register / trade / registered wallet / export guard) — `references/participation.md`
- **Details** (rules / prize pool / four reward sections) — `references/details.md`
- **Rank** (leaderboard / my own rank with CASE 1/2/3 templates) — `references/rank.md`
- **Claim** (reward status check / atomic claim / contact collection) — `references/claim.md`
- **CLI reference** (commands, parameters, return schemas) — `references/cli-reference.md`

This SKILL.md holds the **global rules** (facts, identity invariants, routing, output rules, time formatting, status codes, error handling) that ALL references depend on. Always read this file first; then jump into the matching reference for the user's intent.

## Facts about every Agentic Wallet competition

Treat the following as **factual ground truth** when the user asks about how a competition works. The two chain-related fields play **distinct, non-overlapping roles** — never conflate them:

- `chainId` — single id. **The claim / reward chain ONLY** (rewards are paid on this chain; its contract address lives here). It is NOT a trading chain unless it also appears in `participateChainIds`.
- `participateChainIds` — array of ids returned by **both `list` and `detail`** endpoints. **The trading chain set.** Trades on any chain in this list count toward the same competition standing.

**Trading-chain set = `participateChainIds`. Claim chain = `chainId`.** These are two separate concepts; the display rules below NEVER union them.

1. **Chain id → display name** mapping. Currently supported competition chains: `1 → Ethereum`, `196 → X Layer`, `501 → Solana`.
2. Never tell a user "your chain doesn't count" without first checking `participateChainIds`.
3. `myRankInfo.userTotal = 0` means the user has not yet hit the qualifying threshold or the backend metric pipeline has not picked up their trades yet — it does **NOT** mean the user's chain is unsupported.
4. `competition_rank` takes a single optional `wallet`. Omit it for self-rank — the tool sends your `accountId` (covers every chain in `participateChainIds` in one call; no chain pick). Pass an explicit address ONLY when querying someone else's rank; the address chain family (EVM `0x...` else Solana) must match the activity's primary chain or the tool rejects the call (no silent wrong-chain queries).

## Identity resolution invariant

The query identity for `competition_rank` and `competition_user_status` is **mutually exclusive**: backend accepts EITHER `accountId` (self) OR `walletAddress` (cross-user) — never both. The answer to "which identity did you use?" is **deterministic from the call shape**.

| Call shape | Identity sent |
|---|---|
| `competition_user_status` (any) | `accountId` — covers every chain in `participateChainIds` in one call |
| `competition_rank` without `wallet` | `accountId` |
| `competition_rank` with `wallet=<addr>` | `walletAddress` — tool validates addr's chain family (EVM `0x...` else Solana) matches activity's `chainId`; mismatch → rejected |
| `competition_claim` (pre-check) | `accountId` |

For multi-activity `competition_user_status` (no `activity_name`), the same `accountId` is reused across all activities — backend joins by accountId.

## Mandatory reading order

**Before producing ANY user-facing message about a competition, you MUST first locate the matching section in the right reference file below and follow its fixed template structure.** Do NOT improvise the format. Do NOT shorten the templates. Do NOT drop sections or merge them. Templates are product-mandated copy (Participation / Skill Quality wording, disclaimer) and must not be paraphrased.

The template **structure is fixed**; the **language follows the user** — see the `## Output Language` rule below. When the user writes Chinese, translate the template strings to natural Chinese. When the user writes English, use English as written. Placeholders (including chain display names from `{supportedChains}`) stay as-is.

Quick router (user intent → reference file + section):

| User intent | Reference file | Section |
|---|---|---|
| "list competitions / show available competitions" | `references/participation.md` | Step 1 — Discover |
| "show details / show rules / show prize pool" | `references/details.md` | Step 2 — View Details |
| "register / join" | `references/participation.md` | Step 3 — Join |
| "trade for me" | `references/participation.md` | Step 4 — Trade (delegates to okx-dex-swap) |
| "leaderboard / full board / who is winning" | `references/rank.md` | Check leaderboard (full board) |
| "my rank / what's my ranking / am I in the prize zone" | `references/rank.md` | Check user's own rank (across ALL leaderboards) |
| "show registered wallet" | `references/participation.md` | Query Registered Wallet |
| "export wallet" | `references/participation.md` | Wallet Export Guard |
| "check my status / did I win" | `references/claim.md` | Check Participation Status |
| "claim reward / claim my prize" | `references/claim.md` | Step 6 — Claim Reward |
| Top-tier winner contact follow-up (`needContact: true` after claim) | `references/claim.md` | Contact collection (top-tier winners only) |

If the user's intent does not clearly map to one of the above, ask which they meant before responding — do **not** invent a freeform format.

## Pre-flight

> Read `../okx-agentic-wallet/_shared/preflight.md`. If missing, read `_shared/preflight.md`.

**Cross-skill routing on common errors**:
- `not logged in` → walk the user through the `okx-agentic-wallet` login flow (email → OTP), then retry the original action.
- Backend status codes (`--status` filter / `status` / `joinStatus` / `rewardStatus`) and error code messages (`11002` / `11003` / `11008` / `1860402` / `address limit reached` / `Sui-chain` / region-blocked / `not eligible`): see `references/cli-reference.md`.

## Command Index

All MCP tools mirror the CLI; MCP variants accept `activity_name` (server-resolves the id) and auto-resolve `accountId` / wallet addresses from the active session. Full flag tables and return shapes: `references/cli-reference.md`.

| # | Command | Auth | Description |
|---|---------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `onchainos competition list [--status 0\|1\|2] [--page-size N] [--page-num N]` | None | List competitions (default `status=0`, active only) |
| 2 | `onchainos competition detail --activity-id <id>` | None | Rules, prize pool, chain, timeline |
| 3 | `onchainos competition rank --activity-id <id> [--wallet <addr>] --sort-type <type> [--limit N]` | None | Leaderboard + user rank. See `references/rank.md` for self/cross-user semantics and `sort-type` discovery. |
| 4 | `onchainos competition user-status [--activity-id <id>]` | Wallet login | Participation & reward status (omit `--activity-id` for all activities) |
| 5 | `onchainos competition join --activity-id <id> --evm-wallet <addr> --sol-wallet <addr> --chain-index <chain_id>` | Wallet login | Register the active account for the competition |
| 6 | `onchainos competition claim --activity-id <id> --evm-wallet <addr> --sol-wallet <addr>` | Wallet login | Atomic claim — signs + broadcasts inside the call. See `references/claim.md`. |
| 7 | `onchainos competition submit-contact --activity-id <id> --contact-type <Telegram\|WeChat\|Email\|Twitter> --contact-value <text>` | Wallet login | Record contact for a top-tier winner; only after a claim with `needContact: true`. See `references/claim.md`. |

`--status` (request filter): `0`=active, `1`=ended, `2`=all
`activityStatus` (response field): **`3`=active, `4`=ended** — different from the request filter

## Output Rules

> **Internal-only IDs vs user-facing display.** Internal numeric IDs (`activityId`, `chainIndex`, `accountId`) are returned in tool responses on purpose — they are needed to chain calls between tools (e.g. after `competition_join`, you may need to call `competition_detail` with the activity id to fill the success template). **Keep them in the data layer; never render them in user-visible messages.**

**Never include any internal id in a message produced for the user — under ANY circumstance, in ANY format.** Identify activities to the user EXCLUSIVELY by `activityName` (or `shortName` if name is unavailable).

**Forbidden user-visible patterns** (do NOT produce output like this):
- `Agentic Trading Contest (#107)`
- `#106 (agenticwallettest1)`
- Any column, row, or inline reference exposing an activity ID (e.g. `competition 107`, an `ID` column, a labeled `Activity ID` row) — same rule, regardless of label, shape, or language.

**Correct user-visible pattern**:
- `Agentic Trading Contest`
- When disambiguating two activities with the same name, append `chainName` (e.g. `Agentic Trading Contest (Solana)`), never the ID.

**Behind the scenes (allowed and expected)**:
- Reading `activityId` from a `competition_user_status` / `competition_join` response and passing it to `competition_detail` to fetch the data needed by a fixed template.
- Any tool-to-tool chaining via numeric ids — as long as the final user-facing message omits them.

When the user asks to act on a specific activity (e.g. "claim Agentic Trading Contest"), the MCP tools `competition_claim` / `competition_join` accept `activity_name` and resolve the id server-side, so you can also use names directly without doing your own lookup.

## Output Language

**Render every fixed template in the user's conversation language.** The template structure (sections, ordering, numbered items, table column count, placeholder positions, the `{supportedChains}` placeholder, and the `[Disclaimer: ...]` block) is fixed and must NOT change. Only the natural-language text inside is translated to the user's language naturally.

**Placeholders are never translated.** `{supportedChains}`, `{chainName}`, `{rewardUnit}`, `{txHash}`, `{accountName}`, etc. are filled with API values verbatim — do not localize them. Chain display names (e.g. `Solana`, `X Layer`, `Base`) come from the canonical id → name mapping and stay as-is in every language.

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Final check before sending — covers the reference-file MUSTs that are easy to skip after a long response. (Rules already covered in earlier sections — internal IDs, `participateChainIds`, `*Formatted`, language/template fidelity — are not repeated here; verify them by following the rules at their home sections.)

- [ ] On a successful registration response → the `[Disclaimer: Digital asset trading involves risk. ...]` line is present on its own line at the end. (→ `participation.md` → Successful registration)
- [ ] On a claim runtime failure (signing / broadcast / network) → the 3-bullet failure-suggestion block is appended. On a pre-check rejection (rewardStatus 0/2/3/4, code 11002, code 11008) → the suggestion block is **OMITTED**. (→ `claim.md` → Fixed failure-suggestion block)
- [ ] Before invoking `competition_claim` → the pre-claim preview line (`You are about to claim {rewardAmount} {rewardUnit} on {chainName}. Reply "confirm" to proceed.`) was rendered and the user replied with an explicit confirmation. (→ `claim.md` → Pre-claim preview)
