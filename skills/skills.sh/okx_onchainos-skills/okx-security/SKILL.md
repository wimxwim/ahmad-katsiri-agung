# Onchain OS Security

5 commands for token risk analysis, DApp phishing detection, transaction pre-execution security, signature safety, and approval management.

## Pre-flight Checks

> Read `../okx-agentic-wallet/_shared/preflight.md`. If that file does not exist, read `_shared/preflight.md` instead.

## Fail-safe Principle (CRITICAL)

### Scan completed — risk detected

If a security scan **completes successfully** and returns `action: "block"` or `action: "warn"`, follow the Risk Action Priority Rule below. The Agent MUST NOT override risk verdicts.

### Scan failed — infrastructure error

If a security scan **fails to complete** (network error, API timeout, rate limiting, malformed response), the Agent MUST:
- Report the error clearly to the user.
- **Ask the user** whether to retry the scan or proceed without scan results.
- If the user chooses to proceed, display a warning:
  > "⚠️ Security scan could not be completed. Proceeding without verification — please ensure you trust this operation."
- Log the skipped scan for auditability.

> A security scan that fails to complete is NOT a "pass". Always inform the user and let them make an explicit decision.

## Risk Action Priority Rule

### tx-scan / sig-scan (transaction & signature scanning)

`block` > `warn` > safe (empty). The top-level `action` field reflects the highest priority from `riskItemDetail`.

| `action` value | Risk Level | Agent Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| (empty/null) | Low risk | Safe to proceed |
| `warn` | Medium risk | Show risk details, ask for explicit user confirmation |
| `block` | High risk | Do NOT proceed, show risk details, recommend cancel |

- Risk scan result is still valid even if simulation fails (`simulator.revertReason` may contain the revert reason).
- If `warnings` field is populated, the scan completed but some data may be incomplete. Still present available risk information.
- An empty/null `action` in a **successful** API response means "no risk detected". But if the API call **failed**, the absence of `action` does NOT mean safe — apply the fail-safe principle.

### token-scan (token risk label scanning)

Token-scan returns a **`riskLevel`** field (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) that represents the overall token risk, computed server-side from all boolean labels, tax thresholds, and additional signals (off-chain intelligence, ML models). The Agent uses this field directly and applies different actions for **buy** vs. **sell** operations.

| `riskLevel` | Buy Action | Sell Action |
|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | `block` — refuse to buy | `warn` — display risk, allow sell |
| **HIGH** | `warn` + **pause** — require explicit yes/no | `warn` — display risk, allow sell |
| **MEDIUM** | `warn` — info notice, continue | `warn` — info notice, continue |
| **LOW** | safe — proceed | safe — proceed |

> Full label catalog, tax threshold rules, and display format are defined in `references/risk-token-detection.md`. **Always load that reference before executing `token-scan`.**

Key principles:
- **`riskLevel` is authoritative**: The API returns the overall risk level server-side. The Agent reads `riskLevel` directly — no client-side computation from individual labels is needed.
- **Buy is stricter than sell**: `CRITICAL` blocks buy but only warns on sell (to allow stop-loss exit).
- **`HIGH` buy requires explicit user confirmation** (yes/no) — do not auto-continue.
- Individual label levels are **not displayed** to the user — only the overall `riskLevel` is shown, with triggered labels listed without level prefixes.
- If `isChainSupported: false`, skip detection with a warning; do not block.
- If API fails, warn but do not block. In swap context, token-scan failures auto-continue with a warning to avoid blocking time-sensitive trades — this overrides the general fail-safe's ask-user behavior.

> Security commands do not require wallet login. They work with any address.

## Chain Name Support

The CLI accepts human-readable chain names and resolves them automatically.

| Chain | Name | chainIndex |
|---|---|---|
| XLayer | `xlayer` | `196` |
| Ethereum | `ethereum` or `eth` | `1` |
| Solana | `solana` or `sol` | `501` |
| BSC | `bsc` or `bnb` | `56` |
| Polygon | `polygon` or `matic` | `137` |
| Arbitrum | `arbitrum` or `arb` | `42161` |
| Base | `base` | `8453` |
| Avalanche | `avalanche` or `avax` | `43114` |
| Optimism | `optimism` or `op` | `10` |
| zkSync Era | `zksync` | `324` |
| Linea | `linea` | `59144` |
| Scroll | `scroll` | `534352` |

**Address format note**: EVM addresses (`0x...`) work across Ethereum/BSC/Polygon/Arbitrum/Base etc. Solana addresses (Base58) and Bitcoin addresses (UTXO) have different formats. Do NOT mix formats across chain types.

## Command Index

| # | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `onchainos security token-scan` | Token risk / honeypot detection (all chains) |
| 2 | `onchainos security dapp-scan` | DApp / URL phishing detection (chain-agnostic) |
| 3 | `onchainos security tx-scan` | Transaction pre-execution security (EVM + Solana) |
| 4 | `onchainos security sig-scan` | Message signature security (EVM only) |
| 5 | `onchainos security approvals` | Token approval / Permit2 authorization query (EVM only) |

## Reference Loading Rules (MANDATORY)

Before executing ANY security command, you **MUST** read the corresponding reference document from `skills/okx-security/references/`. Do NOT rely on prior knowledge — always load the reference first.

| User intent | Read this file FIRST |
|---|---|
| Token safety, honeypot, is this token safe, 代币安全, 蜜罐检测, 貔貅盘 | `references/risk-token-detection.md` |
| DApp/URL phishing, is this site safe, 钓鱼网站 | `references/risk-domain-detection.md` |
| Transaction safety, tx pre-execution, signature safety, approve safety, 交易安全, 签名安全 | `references/risk-transaction-detection.md` |
| Approvals, allowance, Permit2, revoke, 授权管理, 授权查询, 风险授权 | `references/risk-approval-monitoring.md` |

> When a workflow involves multiple commands (e.g., token-scan then tx-scan), load each reference before executing that command.

## Integration with Other Skills

Security scanning is often a prerequisite for other wallet operations:
- Before `wallet send` with a contract token: run `token-scan` to verify token safety
- Before `wallet contract-call` with approve calldata: run `tx-scan` to check spender
- Before interacting with any DApp URL: run `dapp-scan`
- Before signing any EIP-712 message: run `sig-scan`

Use `okx-agentic-wallet` skill for the subsequent send/contract-call operations.
