description: This skill should be used when analyzing technical debt in a codebase, documenting code quality issues, creating technical debt registers, or assessing code maintainability. Use this for identifying code smells, architectural issues, dependency problems, missing documentation, security vulnerabilities, and creating comprehensive technical debt documentation.

# Technical Debt Analyzer

Systematically identify, analyze, and document technical debt.

## When to Use

**Use for:**

- Analyzing code quality issues
- Creating technical debt registers
- Assessing code maintainability
- Identifying dependency problems
- Documenting security vulnerabilities
- Planning refactoring efforts

**Don't use when:**

- Writing new code → use `generic-feature-developer`
- Code review → use `generic-code-reviewer`
- Writing tests → use `test-specialist`

## Quick Analysis Commands

```bash
# Find large files (>500 lines)
find src -name "*.ts" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '$1 > 500' | sort -rn

# Find TODO/FIXME markers
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" src/

# Check for console.log in production code
grep -rn "console.log" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"

# Find TypeScript 'any' usage
grep -rn ": any" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"

# Check outdated dependencies
npm outdated

# Security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Unused exports (requires ts-unused-exports)
npx ts-unused-exports tsconfig.json
```

## Debt Categories

| Category      | Examples                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Code Quality  | Large files, complex functions, TODO/FIXME markers     |
| Architectural | Tight coupling, missing abstractions, circular deps    |
| Test          | Missing coverage, fragile tests, slow execution        |
| Documentation | Missing README, outdated docs, no ADRs                 |
| Dependency    | Outdated packages, security vulnerabilities            |
| Performance   | N+1 queries, memory leaks, large bundles               |
| Security      | Missing validation, exposed secrets, XSS/SQL injection |

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Automated Detection

**Code Smells to Check:**

- Large files (>500 lines)
- Complex functions (cyclomatic complexity >10)
- Debt markers (TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX)
- Console statements in production code
- `any` types in TypeScript
- Long parameter lists (>5 params)
- Deep nesting (>4 levels)

**Dependency Issues:**

- Deprecated packages
- Duplicate functionality
- Loose version constraints
- Known vulnerabilities

### 2. Severity Assessment

| Severity | Criteria                              | Action          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Critical | Security vulns, data loss risk        | Immediate fix   |
| High     | Performance problems, blocking issues | Current sprint  |
| Medium   | Code quality, missing docs            | This quarter    |
| Low      | Minor smells, optimizations           | When convenient |

### 3. Priority Matrix

| Impact / Effort | Low       | Medium    | High      |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| High Impact     | Do First  | Do Second | Plan & Do |
| Medium Impact   | Do Second | Plan & Do | Consider  |
| Low Impact      | Quick Win | Consider  | Avoid     |

## Debt Register Format

```markdown
## DEBT-001: Description

**Category:** Code Quality | **Severity:** High
**Location:** src/services/UserService.ts

**Description:** Brief description of the issue

**Impact:**

- Business: How it affects delivery
- Technical: Why it's problematic
- Risk: What could go wrong

**Proposed Solution:** What to do about it
**Effort:** Days/hours estimate
**Target:** Sprint/quarter
```

## Prevention Strategies

### Automated Guards

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "complexity": ["error", 10],
    "max-lines-per-function": ["error", 50],
    "max-params": ["error", 5],
    "max-depth": ["error", 4]
  }
}
```

### Maintenance Schedule

| Frequency | Tasks                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Weekly    | Review TODO/FIXME, update register |
| Monthly   | Dependency updates, debt review    |
| Quarterly | Full analysis, architecture review |

## Self-Critique Checklist

After completing debt analysis:

- [ ] All automated checks run
- [ ] Manual review of critical paths done
- [ ] Severity assessments justified
- [ ] Proposed solutions are actionable
- [ ] Priority matrix applied consistently
- [ ] Register entries are complete
