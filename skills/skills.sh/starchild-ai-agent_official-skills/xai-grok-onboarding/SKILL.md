# 🟢 xAI OAuth Onboarding

Use any active **xAI account** — X Premium, X Premium+, SuperGrok, or SuperGrok Heavy — for `grok-4.3`, `grok-build-0.1`, `grok-4.20-*` and multi-agent models. No separate API key needed.

This is **standard OAuth 2.0** (RFC 8628 Device Authorization Grant), not a vendor-custom flow.

## Tier → model access

The JWT issued by `auth.x.ai` carries a `tier` claim; higher tiers unlock more models from `/v1/models`. Observed mapping (xAI does not publish this officially):

| Tier | Subscription | Approx. model access |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | X Premium ($8/mo) | grok-4.3 baseline |
| 2 | X Premium+ ($16/mo) | + grok-4.20-0309 variants |
| 3 | SuperGrok ($30/mo) | + reasoning models |
| 4 | SuperGrok Heavy ($300/mo) | + grok-build-0.1 + multi-agent |

`status()` reports the user's tier so they know which models will be available.

This is a **script-mode skill** — no tools registered. Read this file, then call the exports from a `bash` block.

- `config/context/references/model-onboarding.md` — overall model-selection landscape

## Backend compatibility

This skill depends on the `core.xai_grok` Python package inside the platform image (shipped 2026-05-22). On older images the skill loads cleanly but every public function returns:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "xai_oauth_backend_unavailable",
  "detail": "ModuleNotFoundError: core.xai_grok not found in any of: [/app, /data/workspace/starchild-clawd]",
  "hint": "Update the platform image OR fall back to byok-custom-model with an xAI API key."
}
```

If you see this response, do NOT retry — the platform itself needs an update. Either wait for the image refresh or guide the user to `byok-custom-model` with an API key from console.x.ai.

## When to use this skill

✅ **Use** when the user EXPLICITLY says one of:
- "Sign in with my Grok / SuperGrok account"
- "Use my SuperGrok / X Premium subscription"
- "Connect SuperGrok Heavy"
- "Login with xAI / Grok"
- "Use my Grok Heavy subscription"

❌ **Do NOT use** for:
- "Add Grok via API key" / "I have an xAI API key" → use `byok-custom-model` (the xAI template)
- Other vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Qwen, etc.) → use `byok-custom-model`
- "Add the Grok model" without subscription mention → ASK the user which path they want (subscription OAuth vs. API key BYOK)

The two paths are mutually exclusive billing-wise. Subscription OAuth uses the user's monthly quota; BYOK API key uses console.x.ai pay-per-token credits.

---

## Critical preflight — account gate awareness

xAI has a known backend gate that **denies OAuth grants for some accounts even with an active SuperGrok subscription**. This is upstream xAI behavior, not a client bug. Symptoms:

- Verification page loads, but clicking "Approve" returns `access_denied` from the token endpoint
- Hermes Agent has documented the same in [issue #26847](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/26847)

If `poll()` returns `AccountAccessDenied`:
1. Verify the user's SuperGrok subscription is active (grok.com / settings)
2. Suggest they try the verification URL in their already-logged-in browser (not a fresh incognito)
3. If still denied → fall back to BYOK API key path (`byok-custom-model` skill, xAI template, key from https://console.x.ai)

Do NOT silently retry — the gate is deterministic per account, retrying wastes time.

---

## Flow

The flow has 4 user-visible steps. Drive it like this:

### 1. start() — generate the verification URL

```bash
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/data/workspace/skills/xai-grok-onboarding')
from exports import start
print(json.dumps(start(), indent=2))
EOF
```

Returns `verification_url_with_code` — tell the user to open it in their browser, log in (if needed), and click Approve.

⚠️ **Wait for explicit user confirmation before calling poll().** Polling too eagerly burns tokens for a "still pending" state.

### 2. poll() — confirm approval (after the user says "done")

```bash
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json, sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/data/workspace/skills/xai-grok-onboarding')
from exports import poll
print(json.dumps(poll(), indent=2))
EOF
```

Three terminal outcomes:
- `status="connected"` → success; show the user `default_model_id` to switch to
- `status="pending"` → user hasn't approved yet; ask them to confirm before re-polling
- `ok=false` with `access_denied` → see "account gate" section above
- `ok=false` with `expired` → device code timed out (15 min); call `start()` again

### 3. After successful connect — tell the user

When `poll()` returns `status='connected'`, the **first thing you must do** is tell the user:

> "Connection successful. Please refresh your browser page — once it reloads, the new `xai-grok/*` models will appear in the model picker."

The web frontend caches the model list client-side and does **not** auto-refresh after an OAuth connect completes. Without a manual page refresh the user will not see their newly available models and will think the connection failed. Always include this instruction in your reply — do not assume the picker updates on its own.

After the refresh, the default model is `xai-grok/grok-4.3`. Other available models depend on the subscription tier (SuperGrok Heavy unlocks `grok-build-0.1`).

To switch: `/model xai-grok/grok-4.3` or use the picker.

## Function reference

| Function | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `status()` | — | Current credential state + available models + expiry |
| `start()` | — | Device code prompt: `{verification_url_with_code, user_code, expires_in_seconds}` |
| `poll(pending_id=None)` | optional `pending_id` | `{status: connected/pending}` + credential info |
| `logout()` | — | Delete credential + flush agent cache |
| `refresh()` | — | Force-refresh access token (debug; normally automatic) |
| `models(force=False)` | — | List available models from the OAuth endpoint |

`force=True` on `models` bypasses the cache TTL.

All functions return a dict with `ok: True` on success or `ok: False, error: "..."` on failure.

---

## After connecting

Models surface with the `xai-grok/` prefix:
- `xai-grok/grok-4.3` — primary chat model (default)
- `xai-grok/grok-build-0.1` — Grok Build coding model (SuperGrok Heavy tier only)
- `xai-grok/grok-4.20-0309-reasoning` — reasoning variant
- `xai-grok/grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning` — faster, no reasoning
- `xai-grok/grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309` — multi-agent variant (uses /v1/responses internally)

User switches via `/model xai-grok/grok-4.3` or the model picker UI.

### Lane routing (transparent)

The provider auto-routes based on model id:
- Multi-agent models → `https://api.x.ai/v1/responses` (Responses API)
- All other Grok models → `https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible)

Users do not need to know which dialect each model speaks — passing the standard `messages=[...]` shape works for both. For multi-agent, an optional `thinking={"effort": "low"|"medium"|"high"}` controls how many agents collaborate.

Subsequent chat calls hit `https://api.x.ai/v1` directly using the OAuth bearer — bypasses the platform proxy. **Subscription usage limits apply** (not the platform credit balance). Image / video models (`grok-imagine-*`) are filtered out of the chat picker but accessible via image generation tools.

## xAI's OAuth allowlist — biggest cause of "frontend rejected my login"

**Critical context (verified from independent implementations, 2026-05):** xAI's backend maintains an internal allowlist on the OAuth API surface and frequently returns `HTTP 403` to OAuth tokens even when the user's subscription is active and the device-code flow itself succeeded. This is documented by Hermes Agent ([their xAI OAuth troubleshooting](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/xai-grok-oauth#http-403-after-a-successful-login-tier--entitlement)) and confirmed by independent OpenCode plugin authors. **It is not a bug in our adapter — switching to PKCE flow does not bypass it (both grant types hit the same allowlist).**

### Subscription tier ↔ OAuth availability (observed, not guaranteed)

| Subscription | Price | OAuth typical outcome |
|---|---|---|
| X Premium (X.com only) | $8 /mo | ❌ Often rejected — not enough entitlement |
| X Premium+ (linked X account) | $16 /mo | ✅ Usually works — xAI auto-links via X account |
| SuperGrok (grok.com direct) | $30 /mo | ⚠️ Mixed — some users blocked, some pass |
| SuperGrok Heavy | $300 /mo | ✅ Reliably works |

### Preflight before starting the flow

If the user has a **standalone X Premium** subscription (not Premium+) or a **SuperGrok base** subscription and is hitting frontend rejection, tell them to do this first, in order:

1. Go to https://grok.com → Settings → Account → **"Connect your X Account"** (links the two identities so xAI can verify subscription status)
2. Make sure the linked X account is the one carrying the Premium / Premium+ tag
3. Sign out + sign back in at https://accounts.x.ai once after linking (refreshes the entitlement)
4. Retry the device-code flow

A large share of reported "OAuth login fails / device code never accepted" cases trace back to **missing X account link** — xAI's backend can't verify the Premium status without the link, and the front door silently rejects the device code.

### When OAuth still fails after preflight → recommend BYOK

The standard fix in the community (Hermes, OpenCode plugin, etc.) is **stop fighting OAuth, switch to API key**:

- The `XAI_API_KEY` path uses a different xAI backend (console.x.ai pay-per-token) that is **not subject to the OAuth allowlist**.
- Tell the user to grab a key at https://console.x.ai and then route them to the `byok-custom-model` skill with the xAI template. Setup is two minutes.
- Trade-off: BYOK bills per-token from a separate wallet instead of using the subscription quota — explain that clearly so the user picks consciously.

### What we do NOT do

- ❌ Spoof referrer / pretend to be another known client (Hermes, grok-cli, etc.) — bypassing entitlement is against ToS and xAI may tighten the allowlist further
- ❌ Retry the device-code flow on `access_denied` — it will keep failing; recommend preflight or BYOK instead
- ❌ Tell the user it's a Starchild bug — it's an xAI account-gating decision we cannot override

---

## Limits & BYOK fallback

xAI does **not** publish exact daily caps or RPM the way OpenAI does. Practical reality for OAuth-backed Grok usage:

- **No published hard numbers.** Limits are fair-use based — xAI throttles temporarily if you generate massive volume in a short window.
- **Tier matters.** Heavy ($300/mo) gives the highest consumer ceiling — significantly above SuperGrok ($30) or X Premium+. Standard text/chat rarely hits the cap for normal-to-heavy daily use.
- **Image / video / voice have tighter quotas.** E.g. Heavy users get roughly ~80+ video generations per 12 hours, but these can still throttle during peak load.
- **Soft ceiling signal:** if the user starts seeing `429` or "rate limit exceeded" messages from xAI, they've hit the fair-use ceiling for that feature. Wait it out (limits reset on a rolling window, not a fixed daily clock) or switch billing modes.

### When to suggest switching to BYOK

If the user wants **predictable, spend-based** high-volume access — or if they're hitting limits often — they can switch to a regular xAI API key:

1. Get a key at https://console.x.ai (pay-per-token, separate from subscription)
2. Use `byok-custom-model` skill with the xAI template
3. BYOK models appear alongside OAuth models in the picker — switch per turn

Both paths can coexist; the user picks per request. OAuth = subscription quota (good default). BYOK = clearer rate limits + per-token billing (good for heavy automation or when you want cost transparency).

### Error → action table

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `429` / "rate limit exceeded" on chat | OAuth fair-use ceiling hit | Wait for soft reset, or switch this request to BYOK |
| `403` / `access_denied` at OAuth time | xAI account gated | Use BYOK (see preflight section above) |
| Repeated `401` after `refresh()` | Token revoked / subscription canceled | `logout()` + restart, or switch to BYOK |
| `503` / 5xx upstream | xAI infra issue | Retry shortly. BYOK uses the same upstream, won't help |

---

## Reauth

Tokens auto-refresh via `refresh_token` (6h access token TTL — relatively generous vs Codex's 1h). If a 401 surfaces:
1. `refresh()` — try the manual refresh path
2. If still failing, `logout()` + restart from `start()`

---

## Critical rules

- **Never paste user_code into the verification URL field for the user.** The URL `accounts.x.ai/oauth2/device?user_code=XXXX` already embeds the code — just open it.
- **Never start the flow without explicit user request.** "I want to use Grok" needs a follow-up question about subscription vs. API key; "use my SuperGrok subscription" is enough.
- **Wait for user confirmation between `start` and `poll`.** Auto-polling wastes API calls and produces stale "pending" responses.
- **On `access_denied`, do NOT retry blindly.** Explain the gate, suggest BYOK fallback.
- **Never log or echo the access_token / refresh_token.** They're persistent credentials. The exports never include them in return values either.
