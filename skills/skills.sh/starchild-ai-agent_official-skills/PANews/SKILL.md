# PANews

PANews is one of China's leading crypto and blockchain media outlets. This skill provides structured access to PANews coverage — breaking news, daily briefings, trending rankings, article search, columns, series, events, editorial picks, and Polymarket smart money leaderboards.

## Common User Phrases

- "What are the biggest crypto stories today?"
- "Can you find coverage about Bitcoin, Solana, or this project?"
- "Show me the latest Polymarket smart money boards."
- "Who is on top of the newest small sharp board?"
- "What changed in the latest smart money board cycle?"

## General principles

- Do not predict price movements or give investment advice
- Content strictly from PANews - do not add information PANews has not reported
- Polymarket smart money board requests are read-only public leaderboard reads, not PANews editorial article coverage
- For publishing content, use the panews-creator skill

## Execution guidance

- Use judgment for open-ended discovery tasks such as briefings, topic research, and trend summaries. Multiple valid paths are acceptable if the result stays grounded in PANews coverage.
- Be more specific for fragile tasks:
  - Article URL or ID provided: resolve the article directly instead of broadening into generic search.
  - Rankings, events, calendar items, and platform picks: use the most direct matching workflow instead of combining unrelated workflows first.
  - Weak or missing PANews coverage: say so directly rather than filling gaps with outside knowledge.
  - Polymarket smart money board tasks: use the dedicated leaderboard workflows instead of article search.
  - Board requests: stay grounded in returned leaderboard fields and highlights; do not infer unsupported market or trader behavior.

## Language

PANews article, ranking, topic, series, column, event, and calendar commands support `--lang`, accepting standard locale strings (e.g. `zh`, `en`, `zh-TW`, `en-US`, `ja-JP`), automatically mapped to the nearest supported language. If omitted, the system locale is auto-detected. Match `--lang` to the user's question language.

Polymarket smart money leaderboard endpoints currently expose fixed public fields and should not be assumed to localize with `--lang`. If the returned board data is in Chinese, translate or summarize it for the user rather than claiming the API itself localized it.

## Scripts

- `scripts/cli.mjs`: unified entrypoint for PANews reader commands

```bash
node {Skills Directory}/panews/scripts/cli.mjs <command> [options]
```

When unsure about parameters, check with `--help` first:

```bash
node {Skills Directory}/panews/scripts/cli.mjs --help
node {Skills Directory}/panews/scripts/cli.mjs <command> --help
```
