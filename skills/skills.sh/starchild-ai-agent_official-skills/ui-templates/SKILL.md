# UI Templates — Human-Designed Template Library

> 380 pre-built HTML/CSS/JS templates from 9 professional template libraries.
> All templates are human-designed with real design quality — NOT AI-generated.

## 1. How to Find Templates

### Step 1 — Determine the Category

Match the user's request to one or more categories from §4 Category Reference.
Be **precise** — match the user's actual stated need, not a generalized assumption.

- "I want a restaurant website" → `restaurant`
- "Build me a portfolio" → `portfolio`
- "I need a blog" → `blog`
- "Make a landing page for my app" → `app` or `landing`
- Unclear or general request → read 2-3 candidate category catalogs and compare

### Step 2 — Read the Category Catalog

Each category has a JSON catalog file: `catalogs/{category}.json` (relative to this skill directory).

```
read_file("skills/ui-templates/catalogs/{category}.json")
```

If no specific category matches, use `catalogs/multipurpose.json`.
For broad requests, read multiple catalogs (e.g., both `personal` and `portfolio`).

### Step 3 — Match Templates Using Catalog Metadata

Each catalog entry contains rich metadata for intelligent selection:

| Field | Type | How to Use |
|-------|------|------------|
| `matchSignals` | string[] | **Primary matching** — keyword array. Match against user's request keywords. |
| `description` | string | 150-700 char detailed visual/structural description. Use to evaluate fit and to present to user. |
| `colorScheme` | `"dark"` / `"light"` / `"mixed"` | Match user's style preference. |
| `visualStyle` | string | One-line visual atmosphere summary. Use to present to user. |
| `layout` | string | `"single-page"` / `"multi-page"` / `"sidebar"` / `"fullscreen"` / `"grid"` / `"dashboard"` |
| `features` | string[] | Functional capabilities (e.g., `"responsive"`, `"search"`, `"accordion"`). |
| `sections` | string[] | Page section types (e.g., `"hero"`, `"pricing"`, `"contact"`). |
| `colorPalette` | object | Full color system with named roles. Use during customization. |
| `typography` | object | Font family, weights, sizes, spacing, style. Use during customization. |
| `source` | string | Template source — indicates quality tier (see §3). |

**Matching priority:**
1. `matchSignals` keyword overlap with user request
2. `features` and `sections` matching user's functional needs
3. `colorScheme` + `visualStyle` matching user's aesthetic preference
4. `source` quality tier (prefer higher tiers)

### Step 4 — Download and Use the Template

Templates are hosted on GCS. Each catalog entry has a `downloadUrl` field pointing to a `.zip` file.

```bash
# Download and extract the template
curl -sL "{downloadUrl}" -o /tmp/template.zip
mkdir -p output/website
unzip -o /tmp/template.zip -d output/website/
rm /tmp/template.zip
```

After extraction, use the `indexPath` field from the catalog entry to locate the `index.html` within the extracted directory.

## 2. Customization Guide

When customizing a template, focus on content replacement while preserving the human-designed structure:

1. **Page title & headings** — Update `<title>` and main headings
2. **Navigation** — Adjust nav links to match actual sections
3. **Body text** — Replace lorem ipsum with real content
4. **Images** — Keep template originals unless user provides their own
5. **Colors** — Use `colorPalette` to understand which CSS properties to modify for brand colors
6. **Fonts** — Keep the template's fonts (already well-chosen by human designers)
7. **Sections** — Add/remove/reorder sections to match user needs
8. **Responsive** — Most templates are already responsive. Check `breakpoints` field.

## 6. Important Notes

- **All 380 templates are usable** — every template has an `index.html` file. Use `indexPath` to find it under `ui-templates/`.
- **Category catalogs** — read `catalogs/{category}.json` for enriched metadata.
- **Keep the human design** — these templates look good because humans designed them. Don't over-modify the CSS structure.
- **Use colorPalette for customization** — when the user has brand colors, use `colorPalette` to understand which CSS colors to replace.
- **Responsive** — most templates are already responsive. Check `breakpoints` for responsive behavior.
