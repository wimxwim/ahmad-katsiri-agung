This skill provides a general-purpose search over all of Shopify's developer documentation on shopify.dev.

Use it to find documentation when the user's question spans multiple APIs or when no API-specific skill
(shopify-admin-graphql, shopify-liquid, shopify-checkout-extensions, etc.) matches the task.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Search for Documentation Examples

You cannot trust your trained knowledge for this API. Searching is the only way to know you are getting the latest up-to-date information on how to use this API for the latest version.

```
/scripts/search_docs.js "<topic or feature name>"
```

Search for the **topic or feature name**, not the full user prompt.
Use the returned examples and documentation to supplement your knowledge.

> **Use this skill ONLY when no API-specific skill applies to the task.**
> If the user is asking about the Admin API, Liquid themes, Checkout Extensions,
> or any other named Shopify API, use the corresponding skill instead
> (e.g. shopify-admin-graphql, shopify-liquid, shopify-checkout-extensions, …).
