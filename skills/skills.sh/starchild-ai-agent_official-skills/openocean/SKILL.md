# OpenOcean Skill (Starchild Adapter)

Use this skill when user asks to:
- get OpenOcean quote
- execute swap via OpenOcean route
- run OpenOcean trade through Starchild wallet

## Runtime Mode

Script-only. Does not register tools.

Imports:
`from skills.openocean.exports import openocean_gas_price, openocean_quote, openocean_swap`

## Functions

- `openocean_gas_price(chain='ethereum')`
- `openocean_quote(chain, in_token, out_token, amount_wei, slippage='1')`
- `openocean_swap(chain, in_token, out_token, amount_wei, slippage='1', verify_timeout_seconds=90, poll_interval_seconds=5)`

## Current Scope

- Ethereum mainnet execution path tested (ETH -> ERC20 and ERC20 -> ETH)
- Uses Starchild wallet runtime (`/agent/transfer`) to broadcast
- Built-in ERC20 approval flow (checks allowance and sends approve when needed)
- Verifies result by balance delta (works when tx hash is delayed)

## Safety Checklist

1. First call `openocean_quote` and show output.
2. Confirm amount and slippage with user.
3. Execute with small amount first.
4. Require verification result (`verified_by_balance_delta=true`) before claiming success.
