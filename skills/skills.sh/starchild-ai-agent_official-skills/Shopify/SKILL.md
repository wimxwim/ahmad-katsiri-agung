# agent-skills

> **Note:** This repo is generated upstream — we do not accept contributions or pull requests here.

A collection of agent skills verified to work with Shopify's development ecosystem. Skills are installable via the `npx skill` CLI and provide Claude Code with API-specific context, documentation search, and code validation for each Shopify surface.

## What are agent skills?

Agent skills are portable instruction sets that extend Claude Code's knowledge for a specific domain. Each skill includes:

- **`SKILL.md`** — instructions and context loaded into Claude's context window
- **`scripts/search_docs.js`** — searches shopify.dev documentation relevant to the skill
- **`scripts/validate.js`** — validates generated code against the API's schema or component library
- **`config.json`** — skill metadata and tool definitions
- **`assets/`** — compressed GraphQL schemas and other offline references
