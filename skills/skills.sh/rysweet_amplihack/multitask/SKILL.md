# Multitask Skill

## Purpose

Execute multiple independent development tasks in parallel. Each workstream runs in an isolated `/tmp` clone with its own Recipe Runner process following code-enforced workflow steps.

**Key Advantage**: Uses Recipe Runner YAML recipes instead of prompt-based markdown workflows. Python controls step execution, making it impossible to skip steps.

## Quick Start

### Inline Tasks

```
/multitask
- #123 (feat/add-auth): Implement user authentication
- #124 (feat/add-logging): Add structured logging
- #125 (feat/update-api): Update API endpoints
```

### JSON Config

Create `workstreams.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "issue": 123,
    "branch": "feat/add-auth",
    "description": "User authentication",
    "task": "Implement JWT-based authentication with login/logout endpoints",
    "recipe": "default-workflow"
  },
  {
    "issue": 124,
    "branch": "feat/add-logging",
    "description": "Structured logging",
    "task": "Add structured JSON logging across all API endpoints"
  }
]
```

Then: `/multitask workstreams.json`

## How It Works

```
User provides task list
        |
        v
For each task:
  1. Clone branch to /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/ws-{issue}/
  2. Write launcher.py (Recipe Runner with CLISubprocessAdapter)
  3. Write run.sh (sets session tree vars, runs launcher.py)
  4. Launch subprocess via Popen
        |
        v
Monitor all workstreams (60s intervals)
        |
        v
Report: PR numbers, success/failure, runtime
```

### Why Recipe Runner?

| Aspect             | Classic (markdown)       | Recipe Runner (YAML)                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Step ordering      | Prompt-based (skippable) | Code-enforced (Python loop)             |
| Template variables | None                     | `{{task_description}}`, `{{repo_path}}` |
| Error handling     | Implicit                 | Fail-fast per step                      |
| Progress tracking  | Opaque                   | Step-by-step status                     |

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **`/tmp` clones** (not worktrees): Worktree symlinks confuse nested Claude sessions. Clean clones avoid this.
2. **`--subprocess-safe`**: Classic mode passes this flag to skip staging/env updates, preventing concurrent write races on `~/.amplihack/.claude/` (issue #2567).
3. **Recipe Runner adapter**: `CLISubprocessAdapter` shells out to `claude -p` for each agent step within the recipe (no `amplihack` wrapper, so no staging race).
4. **Child env cleanup**: The shared `build_child_env()` utility strips blocking env vars and propagates session tree context.

## Execution Modes

### Recipe Mode (Default)

Each workstream runs `amplihack recipe run` via a launcher script:

```bash
amplihack recipe run amplifier-bundle/recipes/default-workflow.yaml \
  -c task_description="TASK_DESCRIPTION_HERE" \
  -c repo_path="."
```



### Classic Mode

Falls back to single-session prompt-based execution with `--subprocess-safe`
to avoid concurrent staging races (see issue #2567):

```bash
amplihack claude --subprocess-safe -- -p "@TASK.md Execute autonomously following DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md."
```

The `--subprocess-safe` flag skips all staging/env updates so parallel
workstreams don't race on `~/.amplihack/.claude/`. The parent `amplihack`
process has already staged the framework files.

Use `--mode classic` when Recipe Runner is unavailable or for tasks that benefit from full session context.

## Available Recipes

Any recipe in `amplifier-bundle/recipes/` can be used per-workstream:

| Recipe                   | Steps | Best For                              |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| `default-workflow`       | 52    | Features, bugs, refactoring (default) |
| `investigation-workflow` | 23    | Research, codebase analysis           |
| `verification-workflow`  | 5     | Trivial changes, config updates       |
| `auto-workflow`          | 9     | Autonomous iteration until complete   |

Specify per-task: `"recipe": "investigation-workflow"` in JSON config.

## Monitoring

```bash
# Watch all logs
tail -f /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/log-*.txt

# Check specific workstream
tail -f /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/log-123.txt

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep launcher.py

# Final report
cat /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/REPORT.md
```

## When to Read Supporting Files

| Need                                   | File                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Full API, config options, architecture | `reference.md`         |
| Timeout policies & lifecycle states    | `TIMEOUT_LIFECYCLE.md` |
| Real-world usage examples              | `examples.md`          |
| Python orchestrator source             | `orchestrator.py`      |

## Disk Management & Cleanup

### Understanding Disk Usage

Each workstream creates a full git clone (~1.5GB). With 10 parallel workstreams, this is ~15GB of temporary disk usage.

**Locations:**

- `/tmp/amplihack-workstreams/ws-{issue}/` - Each workstream's working directory
- `/tmp/amplihack-workstreams/log-{issue}.txt` - Log files (kept separately)
- `/tmp/amplihack-workstreams/REPORT.md` - Final execution report

### When to Clean Up

**✅ SAFE to delete:**

- PR has been merged to main
- You've finished debugging/inspecting the workstream
- You need disk space for new workstreams
- All PRs from a multitask session are complete

**❌ NOT safe to delete:**

- PR is still under review
- PR has merge conflicts you need to resolve manually
- You might need to inspect the working directory for debugging
- Workstream failed and you haven't diagnosed the issue

### Manual Cleanup Commands

```bash
# Check disk usage first
du -sh /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/*

# Clean up specific workstream (after PR merged)
rm -rf /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/ws-123

# Clean up all workstreams (after all PRs merged)
rm -rf /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/ws-*

# Keep log files, delete only working directories
find /tmp/amplihack-workstreams -type d -name "ws-*" -exec rm -rf {} +

# Check available disk space
df -h /tmp
```

### Automatic Cleanup (Helper Command)

After merging PRs, use the cleanup helper to automatically remove merged workstreams:

```bash
# Clean up all workstreams with merged PRs
python .claude/skills/multitask/orchestrator.py --cleanup workstreams.json

# Dry run (show what would be deleted)
python .claude/skills/multitask/orchestrator.py --cleanup --dry-run workstreams.json
```

The cleanup helper:

- Checks each workstream's PR status using `gh` CLI
- Only deletes workstreams with `MERGED` status
- Preserves log files for historical reference
- Reports disk space freed

### Disk Space Monitoring

The orchestrator automatically checks disk space before launching workstreams:

```
⚠️  WARNING: Only 8.2GB free in /tmp
Each workstream requires ~1.5GB. Consider cleaning up:
  rm -rf /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/ws-*
Continue anyway? (y/N):
```

**Rule of thumb:** Keep at least 20GB free for comfortable multi-workstream development.

### Preventing Disk Issues

1. **Before large multitask runs** (10+ workstreams):

   ```bash
   df -h /tmp  # Check available space
   rm -rf /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/ws-*  # Clean old workstreams
   ```

2. **After merging PRs**:

   ```bash
   python orchestrator.py --cleanup workstreams.json
   ```

3. **Monitor during execution**:
   ```bash
   watch -n 60 'du -sh /tmp/amplihack-workstreams && df -h /tmp'
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**Empty log files**: Process started but exited immediately. Check if `amplihack` package is importable in the clone's environment.

**Recipe not found**: Ensure `amplifier-bundle/recipes/` exists in the cloned branch. The recipe discovery checks this directory first.

**Fallback**: If recipe mode fails, retry with `--mode classic` to use the prompt-based approach.

**Disk full during execution**: The orchestrator warns if <10GB free. If disk fills mid-execution, manually clean up: `rm -rf /tmp/amplihack-workstreams/ws-*` (after stopping running workstreams).
