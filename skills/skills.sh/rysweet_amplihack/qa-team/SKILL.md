# QA Team Skill

## Purpose [LEVEL 1]

This skill helps you create **agentic outside-in tests** that verify application behavior from an external user's perspective without any knowledge of internal implementation. Using the gadugi-agentic-test framework, you write declarative YAML scenarios that AI agents execute, observe, and validate.

**Key Principle**: Tests describe WHAT should happen, not HOW it's implemented. Agents figure out the execution details.

## When to Use This Skill [LEVEL 1]

### Perfect For

- **Smoke Tests**: Quick validation that critical user flows work
- **Behavior-Driven Testing**: Verify features from user perspective
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Same test logic for CLI, TUI, Web, Electron
- **Refactoring Safety**: Tests remain valid when implementation changes
- **AI-Powered Testing**: Let agents handle complex interactions
- **Documentation as Tests**: YAML scenarios double as executable specs

### Use This Skill When

- Starting a new project and defining expected behaviors
- Refactoring code and need tests that won't break with internal changes
- Testing user-facing applications (CLI tools, TUIs, web apps, desktop apps)
- Writing acceptance criteria that can be automatically verified
- Need tests that non-developers can read and understand
- Want to catch regressions in critical user workflows
- Testing complex multi-step interactions

### Don't Use This Skill When

- Need unit tests for internal functions (use test-gap-analyzer instead)
- Testing performance or load characteristics
- Need precise timing or concurrency control
- Testing non-interactive batch processes
- Implementation details matter more than behavior

## Core Concepts [LEVEL 1]

### Outside-In Testing Philosophy

**Traditional Inside-Out Testing**:

```python
# Tightly coupled to implementation
def test_calculator_add():
    calc = Calculator()
    result = calc.add(2, 3)
    assert result == 5
    assert calc.history == [(2, 3, 5)]  # Knows internal state
```

**Agentic Outside-In Testing**:

```yaml
# Implementation-agnostic behavior verification
scenario:
  name: "Calculator Addition"
  steps:
    - action: launch
      target: "./calculator"
    - action: send_input
      value: "add 2 3"
    - action: verify_output
      contains: "Result: 5"
```

**Benefits**:

- Tests survive refactoring (internal changes don't break tests)
- Readable by non-developers (YAML is declarative)
- Platform-agnostic (same structure for CLI/TUI/Web/Electron)
- AI agents handle complexity (navigation, timing, screenshots)

### The Gadugi Agentic Test Framework [LEVEL 2]

Gadugi-agentic-test is a Python framework that:

1. **Parses YAML test scenarios** with declarative steps
2. **Dispatches to specialized agents** (CLI, TUI, Web, Electron agents)
3. **Executes actions** (launch, input, click, wait, verify)
4. **Collects evidence** (screenshots, logs, output captures)
5. **Validates outcomes** against expected results
6. **Generates reports** with evidence trails

**Architecture**:

```
YAML Scenario → Scenario Loader → Agent Dispatcher → Execution Engine
                                          ↓
                     [CLI Agent, TUI Agent, Web Agent, Electron Agent]
                                          ↓
                           Observers → Comprehension Agent
                                          ↓
                                   Evidence Report
```

### Progressive Disclosure Levels [LEVEL 1]

This skill teaches testing in four levels:

- **Level 1: Fundamentals** - Basic single-action tests, simple verification
- **Level 2: Intermediate** - Multi-step flows, conditional logic, error handling
- **Level 3: Advanced** - Custom agents, visual regression, performance validation
- **Level 4: Parity & Shadowing** - Side-by-side A/B comparison, remote observable runs, rollout divergence logging

Each example is marked with its level. Start at Level 1 and progress as needed.

## Side-by-Side Parity and A/B Validation [LEVEL 2]

QA Team is the renamed primary skill for what used to be `outside-in-testing`. Use it for standard outside-in scenarios **and** for parity loops where you must compare a legacy implementation to a replacement, or compare approach A to approach B, as an external user would observe them.

### Use QA Team for parity work when

- migrating Python to Rust, old CLI to new CLI, or v1 to v2 behavior
- validating a rewrite before switching defaults
- comparing branch A vs branch B using the same user scenarios
- running observable side-by-side sessions in paired virtual TTYs
- logging rollout divergences in shadow mode without failing the run

### Recommended parity loop

1. Define shared user-facing scenarios first.
2. Run both implementations in isolated sandboxes.
3. Compare stdout, stderr, exit code, JSON outputs, and filesystem side effects.
4. Re-run in `--observable` mode when you need paired tmux panes for debugging.
5. Use `--ssh-target <host>` when parity must happen on a remote environment such as `azlin`.
6. Use `--shadow-mode --shadow-log <file>` during rollout to log divergences without blocking execution.

### Command pattern to reuse

If the repo already has a parity harness, extend it instead of inventing a second one. A good baseline is:

```bash
python tests/parity/validate_cli_parity.py \
  --scenario tests/parity/scenarios/feature.yaml \
  --python-repo /path/to/legacy-repo \
  --rust-binary /path/to/new-binary \
  --observable
```

For remote parity:

```bash
python tests/parity/validate_cli_parity.py \
  --ssh-target azlin \
  --scenario tests/parity/scenarios/feature.yaml \
  --python-repo /remote/path/to/legacy-repo \
  --rust-binary /remote/path/to/new-binary
```

For rollout shadow logging:

```bash
python tests/parity/validate_cli_parity.py \
  --scenario tests/parity/scenarios/feature.yaml \
  --python-repo /path/to/legacy-repo \
  --rust-binary /path/to/new-binary \
  --shadow-mode \
  --shadow-log /tmp/feature-shadow.jsonl
```

## Quick Start [LEVEL 1]

### Installation

**Prerequisites (for native module compilation):**

```bash
# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3

# Windows: Install Visual Studio Build Tools with "Desktop development with C++"
```

**Install the framework:**

The gadugi-agentic-test framework is not published to npm. Install it from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rysweet/gadugi-agentic-test.git
cd gadugi-agentic-test

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Verify the build succeeded
node dist/cli.js --version
```

> **Tip**: If you want CLI-style access from anywhere, you can add an alias:
>
> ```bash
> alias gadugi-test="node /path/to/gadugi-agentic-test/dist/cli.js"
> ```

### Your First Test (CLI Example)

Create `test-hello.yaml`:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Hello World CLI Test"
  description: "Verify CLI prints greeting"
  type: cli

  prerequisites:
    - "./hello-world executable exists"

  steps:
    - action: launch
      target: "./hello-world"

    - action: verify_output
      contains: "Hello, World!"

    - action: verify_exit_code
      expected: 0
```

Run the test:

```bash
node dist/cli.js run -s test-hello -d ./
```

Output:

```
✓ Scenario: Hello World CLI Test
  ✓ Step 1: Launched ./hello-world
  ✓ Step 2: Output contains "Hello, World!"
  ✓ Step 3: Exit code is 0

PASSED (3/3 steps successful)
Evidence saved to: ./evidence/test-hello-20250116-093045/
```

### Understanding the YAML Structure [LEVEL 1]

Every test scenario has this structure:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Descriptive test name"
  description: "What this test verifies"
  type: cli | tui | web | electron

  # Optional metadata
  tags: [smoke, critical, auth]
  timeout: 30s

  # What must be true before test runs
  prerequisites:
    - "Condition 1"
    - "Condition 2"

  # The test steps (executed sequentially)
  steps:
    - action: action_name
      parameter1: value1
      parameter2: value2

    - action: verify_something
      expected: value

  # Optional cleanup

```

## Test Scenario Anatomy [LEVEL 2]

### Metadata Section

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Clear descriptive name"
  description: "Detailed explanation of what this test verifies"
  type: cli | tui | web | electron

  # Optional fields
  tags: [smoke, regression, auth, payment]
  priority: high | medium | low
  timeout: 60s # Overall scenario timeout
  retry_on_failure: 2 # Retry count

  # Environment requirements
  environment:
    variables:
      API_URL: "http://localhost:8080"
      DEBUG: "true"
    files:
      - "./config.json must exist"
```

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites are conditions that must be true before the test runs. The framework validates these before execution.

```yaml
prerequisites:
  - "./application binary exists"
  - "Port 8080 is available"
  - "Database is running"
  - "User account test@example.com exists"
  - "File ./test-data.json exists"
```

If prerequisites fail, the test is skipped (not failed).

### Steps

Steps execute sequentially. Each step has:

- **action**: Required - the action to perform
- **Parameters**: Action-specific parameters
- **description**: Optional - human-readable explanation
- **timeout**: Optional - step-specific timeout
- **continue_on_failure**: Optional - don't fail scenario if step fails

```yaml
steps:
  # Simple action
  - action: launch
    target: "./app"

  # Action with multiple parameters
  - action: verify_output
    contains: "Success"
    timeout: 5s
    description: "App should print success message"

  # Continue even if this fails
  - action: click
    selector: ".optional-button"
    continue_on_failure: true
```

### Verification Actions [LEVEL 1]

Verification actions check expected outcomes. They fail the test if expectations aren't met.

**Common Verifications**:

```yaml
# CLI: Check output contains text
- action: verify_output
  contains: "Expected text"

# CLI: Check output matches regex
- action: verify_output
  matches: "Result: \\d+"

# CLI: Check exit code
- action: verify_exit_code
  expected: 0

# Web/TUI: Check element exists
- action: verify_element
  selector: ".success-message"

# Web/TUI: Check element contains text
- action: verify_element
  selector: "h1"
  contains: "Welcome"

# Web: Check URL
- action: verify_url
  equals: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"

# Web: Check element count
- action: verify_element
  selector: ".list-item"
  count: 5

# Electron: Check window state
- action: verify_window
  title: "My App"
  visible: true
  focused: true
```

### Cleanup Section

Cleanup runs after all steps complete (success or failure). Use for teardown actions.

```yaml
cleanup:
  - action: stop_application
    force: true

  - action: delete_file
    path: "./temp-test-data.json"

  - action: reset_database
    connection: "test_db"
```

## Advanced Patterns [LEVEL 2]

### Conditional Logic

Execute steps based on conditions:

```yaml
steps:
  - action: launch
    target: "./app"

  - action: verify_output
    contains: "Login required"
    id: login_check

  # Only run if login_check passed
  - action: send_input
    value: "login admin password123\n"
    condition: login_check.passed
```

### Variables and Templating [LEVEL 2]

Define variables and use them throughout the scenario:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Test with Variables"
  type: cli

  variables:
    username: "testuser"
    api_url: "http://localhost:8080"

  steps:
    - action: launch
      target: "./app"
      args: ["--api", "${api_url}"]

    - action: send_input
      value: "login ${username}\n"

    - action: verify_output
      contains: "Welcome, ${username}!"
```

### Loops and Repetition [LEVEL 2]

Repeat actions multiple times:

```yaml
steps:
  - action: launch
    target: "./app"

  # Repeat action N times
  - action: send_keypress
    value: "down"
    times: 5

  # Loop over list
  - action: send_input
    value: "${item}\n"
    for_each:
      - "apple"
      - "banana"
      - "cherry"
```

### Error Handling [LEVEL 2]

Handle expected errors gracefully:

```yaml
steps:
  - action: send_input
    value: "invalid command\n"

  # Verify error message appears
  - action: verify_output
    contains: "Error: Unknown command"
    expected_failure: true

  # App should still be running
  - action: verify_running
    expected: true
```

### Multi-Step Workflows [LEVEL 2]

Complex scenarios with multiple phases:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "E-commerce Purchase Flow"
  type: web

  steps:
    # Phase 1: Authentication
    - action: navigate
      url: "http://localhost:3000/login"

    - action: type
      selector: "#username"
      value: "test@example.com"

    - action: type
      selector: "#password"
      value: "password123"

    - action: click
      selector: "button[type=submit]"

    - action: wait_for_url
      contains: "/dashboard"

    # Phase 2: Product Selection
    - action: navigate
      url: "http://localhost:3000/products"

    - action: click
      text: "Add to Cart"
      nth: 1

    - action: verify_element
      selector: ".cart-badge"
      contains: "1"

    # Phase 3: Checkout
    - action: click
      selector: ".cart-icon"

    - action: click
      text: "Proceed to Checkout"

    - action: fill_form
      fields:
        "#shipping-address": "123 Test St"
        "#city": "Testville"
        "#zip": "12345"

    - action: click
      selector: "#place-order"

    - action: wait_for_element
      selector: ".order-confirmation"
      timeout: 10s

    - action: verify_element
      selector: ".order-number"
      exists: true
```

## Level 3: Advanced Topics [LEVEL 3]

### Custom Comprehension Agents

The framework uses AI agents to interpret application output and determine if tests pass. You can customize these agents for domain-specific logic.

**Default Comprehension Agent**:

- Observes raw output (text, HTML, screenshots)
- Applies general reasoning to verify expectations
- Returns pass/fail with explanation

**Custom Comprehension Agent** (see `examples/custom-agents/custom-comprehension-agent.yaml`):

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Financial Dashboard Test with Custom Agent"
  type: web

  # Define custom comprehension logic
  comprehension_agent:
    model: "gpt-4"
    system_prompt: |
      You are a financial data validator. When verifying dashboard content:
      1. All monetary values must use proper formatting ($1,234.56)
      2. Percentages must include % symbol
      3. Dates must be in MM/DD/YYYY format
      4. Negative values must be red
      5. Chart data must be logically consistent

      Be strict about formatting and data consistency.

    examples:
      - input: "Total Revenue: 45000"
        output: "FAIL - Missing currency symbol and comma separator"
      - input: "Total Revenue: $45,000.00"
        output: "PASS - Correctly formatted"

  steps:
    - action: navigate
      url: "http://localhost:3000/financial-dashboard"

    - action: verify_element
      selector: ".revenue-widget"
      use_custom_comprehension: true
      description: "Revenue should be properly formatted"
```

### Visual Regression Testing [LEVEL 3]

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Visual Regression - Homepage"
  type: web

  steps:
    - action: navigate
      url: "http://localhost:3000"

    - action: wait_for_element
      selector: ".page-loaded"

    - action: screenshot
      save_as: "homepage.png"

    - action: visual_compare
      screenshot: "homepage.png"

  steps:
    - action: navigate
      url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard"
      measure_timing: true

    - action: verify_performance

```bash
gadugi-test run test-scenario.yaml
```

**Multiple tests**:

```bash
gadugi-test run tests/*.yaml
```

**With options**:

```bash
gadugi-test run test.yaml \
  --verbose \
  --evidence-dir ./test-evidence \
  --retry 2 \
  --timeout 60s
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/agentic-tests.yml`):

```yaml
name: Agentic Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install gadugi-agentic-test
        run: npm install -g @gadugi/agentic-test

      - name: Run tests
        run: gadugi-test run tests/agentic/*.yaml

      - name: Upload evidence
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: test-evidence
          path: ./evidence/
```

### Evidence Collection

The framework automatically collects evidence for debugging:

```

```

## Best Practices [LEVEL 2]

### 1. Start Simple, Add Complexity

Begin with basic smoke tests, then add detail:

```yaml
# Level 1: Basic smoke test
steps:
  - action: launch
    target: "./app"
  - action: verify_output
    contains: "Ready"

# Level 2: Add interaction
steps:
  - action: launch
    target: "./app"
  - action: send_input
    value: "command\n"
  - action: verify_output
    contains: "Success"

# Level 3: Add error handling and edge cases
steps:
  - action: launch
    target: "./app"
  - action: send_input
    value: "invalid\n"
  - action: verify_output
    contains: "Error"
  - action: send_input
    value: "command\n"
  - action: verify_output
    contains: "Success"
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Names and Descriptions

```yaml
# Bad
scenario:
  name: "Test 1"
  steps:
    - action: click
      selector: "button"

# Good
scenario:
  name: "User Login Flow - Valid Credentials"
  description: "Verifies user can log in with valid email and password"
  steps:
    - action: click
      selector: "button[type=submit]"
      description: "Submit login form"
```

### 3. Verify Critical Paths Only

Don't test every tiny detail. Focus on user-facing behavior:

```yaml
# Bad - Tests implementation details
- action: verify_element
  selector: ".internal-cache-status"
  contains: "initialized"

# Good - Tests user-visible behavior
- action: verify_element
  selector: ".welcome-message"
  contains: "Welcome back"
```

### 4. Use Prerequisites for Test Dependencies

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "User Profile Edit"

  prerequisites:
    - "User testuser@example.com exists"
    - "User is logged in"
    - "Database is seeded with test data"

  steps:
    # Test assumes prerequisites are met
    - action: navigate
      url: "/profile"
```

### 5. Keep Tests Independent

Each test should set up its own state and clean up:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Create Document"

  steps:
    # Create test user (don't assume exists)
    - action: api_call
      endpoint: "/api/users"
      method: POST
      data: { email: "test@example.com" }

    # Run test
    - action: navigate
      url: "/documents/new"
    # ... test steps ...

  cleanup:
    # Remove test user
    - action: api_call
      endpoint: "/api/users/test@example.com"
      method: DELETE
```

### 6. Use Tags for Organization

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Critical Payment Flow"
  tags: [smoke, critical, payment, e2e]
  # Run with: gadugi-test run --tags critical
```

### 7. Add Timeouts Strategically

```yaml
steps:
  # Quick operations - short timeout
  - action: click
    selector: "button"
    timeout: 2s

  # Network operations - longer timeout
  - action: wait_for_element
    selector: ".data-loaded"
    timeout: 10s

  # Complex operations - generous timeout
  - action: verify_element
    selector: ".report-generated"
    timeout: 60s
```

## Testing Strategies [LEVEL 2]

### Smoke Tests

Minimal tests that verify critical functionality works:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Smoke Test - Application Starts"
  tags: [smoke]

  steps:
    - action: launch
      target: "./app"
    - action: verify_output
      contains: "Ready"
      timeout: 5s
```

Run before every commit: `gadugi-test run --tags smoke`

### Happy Path Tests

Test the ideal user journey:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Happy Path - User Registration"

  steps:
    - action: navigate
      url: "/register"
    - action: type
      selector: "#email"
      value: "newuser@example.com"
    - action: type
      selector: "#password"
      value: "SecurePass123!"
    - action: click
      selector: "button[type=submit]"
    - action: wait_for_url
      contains: "/welcome"
```

### Error Path Tests

Verify error handling:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Error Path - Invalid Login"

  steps:
    - action: navigate
      url: "/login"
    - action: type
      selector: "#email"
      value: "invalid@example.com"
    - action: type
      selector: "#password"
      value: "wrongpassword"
    - action: click
      selector: "button[type=submit]"
    - action: verify_element
      selector: ".error-message"
      contains: "Invalid credentials"
```

### Regression Tests

Prevent bugs from reappearing:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: "Regression - Issue #123 Password Reset"
  tags: [regression, bug-123]
  description: "Verifies password reset email is sent (was broken in v1.2)"

  steps:
    - action: navigate
      url: "/forgot-password"
    - action: type
      selector: "#email"
      value: "user@example.com"
    - action: click
      selector: "button[type=submit]"
    - action: verify_element
      selector: ".success-message"
      contains: "Reset email sent"
```

## Philosophy Alignment [LEVEL 2]

This skill follows amplihack's core principles:

### Ruthless Simplicity

- **YAML over code**: Declarative tests are simpler than programmatic tests
- **No implementation details**: Tests describe WHAT, not HOW
- **Minimal boilerplate**: Each test is focused and concise

### Modular Design (Bricks & Studs)

- **Self-contained scenarios**: Each YAML file is independent
- **Clear contracts**: Steps have well-defined inputs/outputs
- **Composable actions**: Reuse actions across different test types

### Zero-BS Implementation

- **No stubs**: Every example in this skill is a complete, runnable test
- **Working defaults**: Tests run with minimal configuration
- **Clear errors**: Framework provides actionable error messages

### Outside-In Thinking

- **User perspective**: Tests verify behavior users care about
- **Implementation agnostic**: Refactoring doesn't break tests
- **Behavior-driven**: Focus on outcomes, not internals

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions [LEVEL 2]

### Pitfall 1: Over-Specifying

**Problem**: Test breaks when UI changes slightly

```yaml
# Bad - Too specific
- action: verify_element
  selector: "div.container > div.row > div.col-md-6 > span.text-primary.font-bold"
  contains: "Welcome"
```

**Solution**: Use flexible selectors

```yaml
# Good - Focused on behavior
- action: verify_element
  selector: ".welcome-message"
  contains: "Welcome"
```

### Pitfall 2: Missing Waits

**Problem**: Test fails intermittently due to timing

```yaml
# Bad - No wait for async operation
- action: click
  selector: ".load-data-button"
- action: verify_element
  selector: ".data-table" # May not exist yet!
```

**Solution**: Always wait for dynamic content

```yaml
# Good - Wait for element to appear
- action: click
  selector: ".load-data-button"
- action: wait_for_element
  selector: ".data-table"
  timeout: 10s
- action: verify_element
  selector: ".data-table"
```

### Pitfall 3: Testing Implementation Details

**Problem**: Test coupled to internal state

```yaml
# Bad - Tests internal cache state
- action: verify_output
  contains: "Cache hit ratio: 85%"
```

**Solution**: Test user-visible behavior

```yaml
# Good - Tests response time
- action: verify_response_time
  less_than: 100ms
  description: "Fast response indicates caching works"
```

### Pitfall 4: Flaky Assertions

**Problem**: Assertions depend on exact timing or formatting

```yaml
# Bad - Exact timestamp match will fail
- action: verify_output
  contains: "Created at: 2025-11-16 09:30:45"
```

**Solution**: Use flexible patterns

```yaml
# Good - Match pattern, not exact value
- action: verify_output
  matches: "Created at: \\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}"
```

### Pitfall 5: Not Cleaning Up

**Problem**: Tests leave artifacts that affect future runs

```yaml
# Bad - No cleanup
steps:
  - action: create_file
    path: "./test-data.json"
  - action: launch
    target: "./app"
```

**Solution**: Always use cleanup section

```yaml
# Good - Cleanup ensures clean slate
steps:
  - action: create_file
    path: "./test-data.json"
  - action: launch
    target: "./app"

cleanup:
  - action: delete_file
    path: "./test-data.json"
```

claude "Use philosophy-guardian to review new test files"

# 4. Include in PR
git add tests/agentic/
git commit -m "Add outside-in tests for auth flow"
```

## Troubleshooting [LEVEL 2]

### Test Times Out

**Symptom**: Test exceeds timeout and fails

**Causes**:

- Application takes longer to start than expected
- Network requests are slow
- Element never appears (incorrect selector)

**Solutions**:

```yaml
# Increase timeout
- action: wait_for_element
  selector: ".slow-loading-element"
  timeout: 30s # Increase from default

# Add intermediate verification
- action: launch
  target: "./app"
- action: wait_for_output
  contains: "Initializing..."
  timeout: 5s
- action: wait_for_output
  contains: "Ready"
  timeout: 20s
```

### Element Not Found

**Symptom**: `verify_element` or `click` fails with "element not found"

**Causes**:

- Incorrect CSS selector
- Element not yet rendered (timing issue)
- Element in iframe or shadow DOM

**Solutions**:

```yaml
# Add wait before interaction
- action: wait_for_element
  selector: ".target-element"
  timeout: 10s
- action: click
  selector: ".target-element"

# Use more specific selector
- action: click
  selector: "button[data-testid='submit-button']"

# Handle iframe
- action: switch_to_iframe
  selector: "iframe#payment-frame"
- action: click
  selector: ".pay-now-button"
```

### Test Passes Locally, Fails in CI

**Symptom**: Test works on dev machine but fails in CI environment

**Causes**:

- Different screen size (web/Electron)
- Missing dependencies
- Timing differences (slower CI machines)
- Environment variable differences

**Solutions**:

```yaml
# Set explicit viewport size (web/Electron)
scenario:
  environment:
    viewport:
      width: 1920
      height: 1080

# Add longer timeouts in CI
- action: wait_for_element
  selector: ".element"
  timeout: 30s  # Generous for CI

# Verify prerequisites
prerequisites:
  - "Chrome browser installed"
  - "Environment variable API_KEY is set"
```

### Output Doesn't Match Expected

**Symptom**: `verify_output` fails even though output looks correct

**Causes**:

- Extra whitespace or newlines
- ANSI color codes in output
- Case sensitivity

**Solutions**:

```yaml
# Use flexible matching
- action: verify_output
  matches: "Result:\\s+Success" # Allow flexible whitespace

# Strip ANSI codes
- action: verify_output
  contains: "Success"
  strip_ansi: true

# Case-insensitive match
- action: verify_output
  contains: "success"
  case_sensitive: false
```

## Level 4: Shadow Environment Integration [LEVEL 4]

Run your outside-in tests in **isolated shadow environments** to validate changes before pushing. This combines the behavioral testing power of gadugi-agentic-test with the clean-state isolation of shadow environments.

### Why Use Shadow Environments for Testing

1. **Clean State**: Fresh container, no host pollution
2. **Local Changes**: Test uncommitted code exactly as-is
3. **Multi-Repo**: Coordinate changes across multiple repos
4. **CI Parity**: What shadow sees ≈ what CI will see

### Shadow Testing Workflow

For complete shadow environment documentation, see the **shadow-testing** skill. Here's how to integrate it with outside-in tests:

#### Pattern 1: CLI Tests in Shadow (Amplifier)

```python
# Create shadow with your local library changes
shadow.create(local_sources=["~/repos/my-lib:org/my-lib"])

# Run outside-in test scenarios inside shadow
shadow.exec(shadow_id, "gadugi-test run test-scenario.yaml")

# Extract evidence
shadow.extract(shadow_id, "/evidence", "./test-evidence")

# Cleanup
shadow.destroy(shadow_id)
```

#### Pattern 2: CLI Tests in Shadow (Standalone)

```bash
# Create shadow with local changes
amplifier-shadow create --local ~/repos/my-lib:org/my-lib --name test

# Run your test scenarios
amplifier-shadow exec test "gadugi-test run test-scenario.yaml"

# Extract results
amplifier-shadow extract test /evidence ./test-evidence

# Cleanup
amplifier-shadow destroy test
```

#### Pattern 3: Multi-Repo Integration Test

```yaml
# test-multi-repo.yaml
scenario:
  name: "Multi-Repo Integration Test"
  type: cli

  prerequisites:
    - "Shadow environment with core-lib and cli-tool"

  steps:
    - action: launch
      target: "cli-tool"

    - action: send_input
      value: "process --lib core-lib\n"

    - action: verify_output
      contains: "Success: Using core-lib"
```

```bash
# Setup shadow with both repos
amplifier-shadow create \
  --local ~/repos/core-lib:org/core-lib \
  --local ~/repos/cli-tool:org/cli-tool \
  --name multi-test

# Run test that exercises both
amplifier-shadow exec multi-test "gadugi-test run test-multi-repo.yaml"
```

#### Pattern 4: Web App Testing in Shadow

```yaml
# test-web-app.yaml
scenario:
  name: "Web App with Local Library"
  type: web

  steps:
    - action: navigate
      url: "http://localhost:3000"

    - action: click
      selector: "button.process"

    - action: verify_element
      selector: ".result"
      contains: "Processed with v2.0" # Your local version
```

```bash
# Shadow with library changes
amplifier-shadow create --local ~/repos/my-lib:org/my-lib --name web-test

# Start web app inside shadow (uses your local lib)
amplifier-shadow exec web-test "
  cd /workspace &&
  git clone https://github.com/org/web-app &&
  cd web-app &&
  npm install &&  # Pulls your local my-lib via git URL rewriting
  npm start &
"

# Wait for app to start, then run tests
amplifier-shadow exec web-test "sleep 5 && gadugi-test run test-web-app.yaml"
```

### Verification Best Practices

When running tests in shadow, always verify your local sources are being used:

```bash
# After shadow.create, check snapshot commits
shadow.status(shadow_id)
# Shows: snapshot_commits: {"org/my-lib": "abc1234..."}

# When your test installs dependencies, verify commit matches
# Look in test output for: my-lib @ git+...@abc1234
```

### Complete Example: Library Change Validation

```yaml
# test-library-change.yaml - Outside-in test
scenario:
  name: "Validate Library Breaking Change"
  type: cli
  description: "Test that dependent app still works with new library API"

  steps:
    - action: launch
      target: "/workspace/org/dependent-app/cli.py"

    - action: send_input
      value: "process data.json\n"

    - action: verify_output
      contains: "Processed successfully"
      description: "New library API should still work"

    - action: verify_exit_code
      expected: 0
```

```bash
# Complete workflow
# 1. Create shadow with your breaking change
amplifier-shadow create --local ~/repos/my-lib:org/my-lib --name breaking-test

# 2. Install dependent app (pulls your local lib)
amplifier-shadow exec breaking-test "
  cd /workspace &&
  git clone https://github.com/org/dependent-app &&
  cd dependent-app &&
  pip install -e . &&  # This installs git+https://github.com/org/my-lib (your local version)
  echo 'Ready to test'
"

# 3. Run outside-in test
amplifier-shadow exec breaking-test "gadugi-test run test-library-change.yaml"

# If test passes, your breaking change is compatible!
# If test fails, you've caught the issue before pushing
```

### When to Use Shadow Integration

Use shadow + outside-in tests when:

- ✅ Testing library changes with dependent projects
- ✅ Validating multi-repo coordinated changes
- ✅ Need clean-state validation before pushing
- ✅ Want to catch integration issues early
- ✅ Testing that setup/install procedures work

Don't use shadow for:

- ❌ Simple unit tests (too much overhead)
- ❌ Tests of already-committed code (shadow adds no value)
- ❌ Performance testing (container overhead skews results)

## Level 4: A/B Comparison Harness & Self-Improving Audit [LEVEL 4]

Reusable tools for running any two CLI implementations side-by-side and
quantifying their behavioral differences. Works for any scenario where you
need to compare two things:

- **Migration parity**: Python→Rust, v1→v2, monolith→microservice
- **A/B testing**: Compare two approaches to the same CLI
- **Feature flag validation**: Same binary, different configs
- **Version regression**: Compare release N with release N+1
- **Canary validation**: Compare canary build against stable

### Tools

Located in `.claude/scenarios/ab-comparison/`:

| File                       | Purpose                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ab_comparison_harness.py` | Run two CLIs side-by-side in isolated sandboxes                |
| `ab_audit_cycle.py`        | Self-improving loop: identify → categorize → fix → re-validate |
| `SCENARIO_FORMAT.md`       | YAML scenario format specification                             |
| `example_scenario.yaml`    | Example scenario for a calculator CLI                          |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Compare any two CLI implementations
python .claude/scenarios/ab-comparison/ab_comparison_harness.py \
    --a "python -m myapp.cli" \
    --b "./target/debug/myapp" \
    --scenario tests/scenarios/*.yaml

# A/B with feature flag
python .claude/scenarios/ab-comparison/ab_comparison_harness.py \
    --a "myapp --feature-flag=off" \
    --b "myapp --feature-flag=on" \
    --scenario tests/scenarios/regression.yaml

# Shadow mode: log divergences without failing (for production rollout)
python .claude/scenarios/ab-comparison/ab_comparison_harness.py \
    --a "myapp-stable" \
    --b "myapp-canary" \
    --scenario tests/scenarios/*.yaml \
    --shadow-mode \
    --shadow-log /tmp/canary-divergences.jsonl

# Self-improving audit cycle (iterate until convergence)
python .claude/scenarios/ab-comparison/ab_audit_cycle.py \
    --a "python -m myapp.cli" \
    --b "./target/debug/myapp" \
    --scenarios-dir tests/scenarios/

# Legacy flags (--legacy/--candidate) also work
python .claude/scenarios/ab-comparison/ab_comparison_harness.py \
    --legacy "python -m myapp.cli" \
    --candidate "./target/debug/myapp" \
    --scenario tests/scenarios/*.yaml
```

### Scenario Format (Summary)

```yaml
cases:
  - name: "unique-test-name"
    category: "install" # For audit grouping
    argv: ["subcommand", "--flag"] # Same args for both sides
    timeout: 15 # Seconds
    env:
      PATH: "${SANDBOX_ROOT}/bin:${PATH}" # Template variables
    setup: | # Bash script run in both sandboxes
      mkdir -p bin
      echo '#!/bin/bash' > bin/stub && chmod +x bin/stub
    compare:
      - exit_code # Integer match
      - stdout # Text or JSON-semantic
      - stderr # Text match
      - "fs:path/to/file" # File/dir hash comparison
      - "jsonfs:path/to/file.json" # JSON semantic comparison
```

See `SCENARIO_FORMAT.md` for the full specification.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Isolated sandboxes**: Each side gets its own HOME, TMPDIR, PATH. No
   collisions between the two runs, or with the host.

2. **JSON-semantic comparison**: `stdout` comparison parses both sides as JSON
   if possible, ignoring key ordering. Falls back to exact text if not JSON.

3. **Stub binary pattern**: Test launcher behavior by providing fake binaries
   that capture their args and env vars to files, then compare those files.

4. **Timeout resilience**: Captures partial output on timeout (exit code 124)
   instead of crashing the harness. Critical for testing commands that may
   hang in sandboxed environments.

5. **Shadow mode**: Logs divergences to append-only JSONL without failing the
   run. Use during rollout to monitor real workloads.

6. **Audit categorization**: Groups divergences by keyword inference and
   generates prioritized fix workstream specs.

### Self-Improvement Cycle Pattern

```
┌─────────────┐
│  IDENTIFY   │  Run all scenarios, collect divergences
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ CATEGORIZE  │  Group by area: install (5), launch (3), recipe (1)
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  SPECIFY    │  Generate fix specs: [CRITICAL] fix-install, [HIGH] fix-launch
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│    FIX      │  Agent/human fixes code
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ RE-VALIDATE │  Run audit again → check progress (5→2 divergences)
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
    Converged? ──no──→ back to FIX
       │
      yes
       ▼
     DONE
```

**Remember**: Outside-in tests verify WHAT your application does, not HOW it does it. Focus on user-visible behavior, and your tests will remain stable across refactorings while providing meaningful validation of critical workflows.

Start at Level 1 with simple smoke tests, and progressively add complexity only when needed. The framework's AI agents handle the hard parts - you just describe what should happen.
