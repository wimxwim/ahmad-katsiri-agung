# LSP Auto-Configuration Skill

**Manual control and troubleshooting for Language Server Protocol (LSP) configuration.**

## Important: LSP is Configured Automatically

**You probably don't need this skill!** LSP is configured automatically when you run `amplihack claude`.

**When amplihack launches Claude Code, it automatically:**

- Detects programming languages in your project
- Sets `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` environment variable
- Installs required LSP plugins via Claude Code plugin marketplace
- Configures project-specific settings in `.env`

**You'll see:** `📡 LSP: Detected 3 language(s): python, javascript...` when amplihack starts Claude Code.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use `/lsp-setup` only when you need to:**

- **Check Status**: Verify LSP configuration is working (`/lsp-setup --status-only`)
- **Troubleshoot Issues**: Diagnose why code intelligence isn't working
- **Force Reconfiguration**: Rebuild LSP config after manual changes (`/lsp-setup --force`)
- **Add New Languages**: Configure LSP for newly added languages

**Don't use this skill if:** LSP is already working! The automatic setup handles 99% of cases.

## Overview

The LSP Setup skill provides manual control over the same LSP auto-configuration that happens automatically at launch. It supports 16 popular programming languages out of the box and gives you direct access to configuration, status checking, and troubleshooting.

## What LSP Provides to You

When LSP is properly configured, Claude Code gains powerful code intelligence capabilities that enhance the AI's understanding of your codebase:

### Real-Time Code Intelligence

**Type Information** - Claude can see the exact types of variables, functions, and classes:

```python
# Claude can hover over 'user' and see: Type: User (class from models.py)
user = get_current_user()
```

**Go to Definition** - Claude can jump to where symbols are defined:

```python
# Claude can navigate from 'authenticate()' call to its definition in auth.py
result = authenticate(credentials)
```

**Code Diagnostics** - Claude receives real-time error detection from LSP servers:

```python
# Pyright reports: "Set" is not accessed
from typing import List, Set  # Claude sees this warning
```

### How Claude Uses LSP

**Better Code Understanding** - Instead of guessing types and behavior, Claude gets precise information from LSP servers about:

- Function signatures and return types
- Class hierarchies and inheritance
- Import paths and module structure
- Errors and warnings before runtime

**Smarter Suggestions** - With LSP data, Claude provides:

- Accurate refactoring recommendations
- Type-safe code completions
- Precise error fixes
- Context-aware code generation

**Example Workflow**:

```
You: "Fix the type error in user_service.py"

Without LSP: Claude reads the file, guesses at types, may miss subtle issues

With LSP: Claude receives diagnostic:
  Line 42: Expected type 'User | None', got 'str'
  → Claude provides exact fix based on actual type information
```

### What You'll Notice

After `/lsp-setup` configures your project:

1. **More Accurate Responses** - Claude's code suggestions match your actual types and APIs
2. **Faster Debugging** - Claude sees the same errors your IDE would show
3. **Better Refactoring** - Claude can safely rename variables across files using LSP references
4. **Improved Navigation** - Claude can find definitions, usages, and implementations precisely

### Important Note

LSP enhances Claude's capabilities _behind the scenes_. You don't interact with LSP directly - it makes Claude smarter about your code automatically.

## When to Use This Skill

Use `/lsp-setup` when you:

- Start working on a new project in Claude Code
- Add a new programming language to an existing project
- Experience missing or incorrect code intelligence features
- Want to verify your LSP configuration is correct
- Need to troubleshoot LSP server connection issues

## How It Works

### LSP Architecture - Three Layers

Claude Code's LSP system uses a three-layer architecture that must all be configured for LSP features to work:

**Layer 1: System LSP Binaries** (User-installed)

- LSP server executables installed on your system via npm, brew, rustup, etc.
- Example: `npm install -g pyright` installs the Pyright LSP server binary
- These are the actual language analysis engines

**Layer 2: Claude Code LSP Plugins** (Installed via cclsp)

- Claude Code plugins that connect to Layer 1 binaries
- Installed using: `npx cclsp install <server-name>`
- The `cclsp` tool uses the `claude-code-lsps` plugin marketplace
- These act as bridges between Claude Code and LSP servers

**Layer 3: Project Configuration** (.env file)

- Project-specific settings: virtual environments, project roots, etc.
- Must include `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` to activate LSP features
- Stored in `.env` at project root

**Important**: `cclsp` and `claude-code-lsps` work together. `cclsp` is the installation tool, `claude-code-lsps` is the plugin marketplace it uses. They are complementary, not alternatives.

### The Skill's 4-Phase Process

The `/lsp-setup` skill automates the workflow from `npx cclsp@latest setup`:

#### Phase 1: Language Detection

Scans your project directory to identify programming languages based on file extensions and framework markers. Detects 16 languages including Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Go, Java, and more.

#### Phase 2: LSP Configuration

Generates the appropriate LSP server configuration for each detected language. Checks if:

1. System LSP binaries are installed (Layer 1)
2. Claude Code plugins are installed (Layer 2)

Provides installation guidance if either is missing. **NEVER auto-installs** - user has full control.

#### Phase 3: Project Configuration

Creates or updates `.env` file with project-specific LSP settings (Layer 3):

- Workspace-specific options (Python virtual environments, Node.js project roots, etc.)
- **ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1** (required for LSP features to activate)

#### Phase 4: Verification

Tests each LSP server connection and reports status. Provides actionable guidance for any configuration issues.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
/lsp-setup
```

Detects all languages in your project and configures LSP servers automatically.

### Check Status Only

```bash
/lsp-setup --status-only
```

Reports current LSP configuration and server availability without making changes.

### Force Reconfiguration

```bash
/lsp-setup --force
```

Regenerates LSP configuration even if valid configuration already exists.

### Specific Languages

```bash
/lsp-setup --languages python,typescript
```

Configures LSP servers only for specified languages.

### Manual Plugin Management

If you need to manage Claude Code LSP plugins directly, use the `cclsp` command:

```bash
# Install a plugin (Layer 2)
npx cclsp install pyright

# List installed plugins
npx cclsp list

# Remove a plugin
npx cclsp remove pyright

# Full setup workflow (what /lsp-setup automates)
npx cclsp@latest setup
```

The `/lsp-setup` skill automates the `npx cclsp@latest setup` workflow, adding intelligent language detection and project-specific configuration.

## How to Verify LSP is Working

After running `/lsp-setup`, here's how to confirm LSP is providing code intelligence to Claude:

### Method 1: Check for Diagnostics

**Ask Claude to analyze a file with intentional errors**:

```
You: "What issues do you see in src/main.py?"

If LSP is working: Claude will report specific diagnostics from Pyright
  → "Line 15: 'name' is not accessed"
  → "Line 23: Expected type 'int', got 'str'"

If LSP is NOT working: Claude only sees what's in the file content
  → Generic observations about code style
  → No specific type errors or warnings
```

### Method 2: Request Type Information

**Ask Claude about types in your code**:

```
You: "What's the type of the 'user' variable in auth.py line 42?"

If LSP is working: Claude provides exact type from LSP
  → "Type: User | None (from models.User)"

If LSP is NOT working: Claude guesses based on context
  → "It appears to be a User object based on the code"
```

### Method 3: Test Navigation

**Ask Claude to find definitions**:

```
You: "Where is the authenticate() function defined?"

If LSP is working: Claude uses LSP goToDefinition
  → "Defined in src/auth/service.py:156"

If LSP is NOT working: Claude searches file contents
  → "I found it by searching for 'def authenticate'"
```

### Method 4: Check Status Command

**Run the status check**:

```bash
/lsp-setup --status-only
```

**Expected Output (LSP Working)**:

```
[LSP Setup] Configuration Status:

✓ Python (pyright): Connected
  - System Binary: /usr/local/bin/pyright-langserver
  - Plugin: Installed and active
  - Project Config: .env configured with ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1

✓ TypeScript (vtsls): Connected
  - System Binary: /usr/local/bin/vtsls
  - Plugin: Installed and active
  - Project Config: .env configured with ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1

Overall Status: ✓ All LSP servers ready (2/2)
```

**Problem Output (LSP NOT Working)**:

```
[LSP Setup] Configuration Status:

✗ Python (pyright): Not Connected
  - System Binary: Not found
  - Plugin: Not installed
  - Project Config: Missing ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1

Issue: Run 'npm install -g pyright' and 'npx cclsp install pyright'
```

### What Success Looks Like

When LSP is working properly, you'll notice:

1. **Claude mentions specific line numbers** when discussing errors
2. **Claude provides exact types** instead of guessing
3. **Claude sees warnings/errors before code runs** (like your IDE does)
4. **Claude can navigate code structure** using LSP's understanding

### What Failure Looks Like

When LSP is NOT working, you'll notice:

1. **Claude only sees file contents** - no type information or diagnostics
2. **Claude makes educated guesses** about types and behavior
3. **Claude doesn't mention errors** until you run the code
4. **Claude searches text** instead of using semantic understanding

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: LSP server not found

**Symptom**: "rust-analyzer: Not found" during configuration

**Solution**: Install the LSP server using the provided installation command

```bash
$ rustup component add rust-analyzer
$ /lsp-setup --force  # Reconfigure after installation
```

### Issue: LSP server crashes on startup

**Symptom**: "pyright: Connection failed" during verification

**Solution**: Check LSP server logs and verify installation

```bash
# Check if server is properly installed
$ which pyright
/usr/local/bin/pyright

# Test server manually
$ pyright --version
pyright 1.1.332

# Check Claude Code LSP logs
$ cat ~/.claude-code/lsp-logs/pyright.log
```

### Issue: Wrong Python interpreter used

**Symptom**: Import errors despite packages being installed in virtual environment

**Solution**: Verify `.env` configuration points to correct Python interpreter

```bash
# Check current configuration
$ cat .env | grep PYTHON

# Should show:
LSP_PYTHON_INTERPRETER=/path/to/.venv/bin/python

# If incorrect, update manually or run:
$ /lsp-setup --force
```

### Issue: TypeScript project not detected

**Symptom**: No TypeScript LSP configuration despite `.ts` files present

**Solution**: Ensure `tsconfig.json` exists in project root

```bash
# Create minimal tsconfig.json
$ cat > tsconfig.json << EOF
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true
  }
}
EOF

$ /lsp-setup --force
```

### Issue: Multiple Python versions causing conflicts

**Symptom**: "Module not found" errors when LSP server uses wrong Python version

**Solution**: Explicitly set Python interpreter in `.env`

```bash
# Edit .env manually
LSP_PYTHON_INTERPRETER=/usr/bin/python3.11

# Or activate the correct virtual environment before running
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ /lsp-setup --force
```

## Configuration Files

### `.env` (Project Root)

The skill creates or updates `.env` with LSP-specific configuration:

```bash
# LSP Configuration - Auto-generated by /lsp-setup
ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1  # REQUIRED: Activates LSP features in Claude Code

# Project-specific settings (Layer 3)
LSP_PYTHON_INTERPRETER=/path/to/.venv/bin/python
LSP_NODE_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/frontend
LSP_RUST_WORKSPACE=/path/to/services
LSP_GO_MODULE=/path/to/go.mod

# Language Server Paths (auto-detected)
LSP_PYRIGHT_PATH=/usr/local/bin/pyright
LSP_VTSLS_PATH=/usr/local/bin/vtsls
LSP_RUST_ANALYZER_PATH=/usr/local/bin/rust-analyzer
```

**Critical**: `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` must be present for LSP features to work. Without it, LSP servers won't be activated.

### Claude Code LSP Configuration

The skill automatically updates Claude Code's LSP configuration. No manual editing required.

## Integration with Claude Code

Once configured, Claude Code automatically:

- Provides code completion based on project context
- Shows real-time diagnostics (errors, warnings)
- Enables "Go to Definition" navigation
- Offers inline documentation on hover
- Suggests intelligent refactorings

## Best Practices

1. **Run at project start**: Configure LSP servers when you first open a project
2. **Update after adding languages**: Rerun `/lsp-setup` when adding new language files
3. **Commit `.env`**: Include LSP configuration in version control for team consistency
4. **Verify after installation**: Use `--status-only` to check server availability
5. **Keep servers updated**: Regularly update LSP servers to latest versions

## Technical Details

**Skill Type**: Interactive command-driven workflow

**Dependencies**: None (pure skill, no external packages)

**Execution Time**: 2-10 seconds depending on project size

**Persistence**: Configuration stored in `.env` and Claude Code settings

**Supported Platforms**: macOS, Linux, WSL

## Execution Instructions (For Claude Code)

When this skill is activated via `/lsp-setup` or activation keywords, execute the following workflow:

### Phase 1: Language Detection

```python
from pathlib import Path
from lsp_setup import LanguageDetector

# Detect languages in current project
detector = LanguageDetector()
project_root = Path.cwd()
languages = detector.detect_languages(project_root)

# Report findings
print(f"Detected {len(languages)} language(s):")
for lang in languages:
    print(f"  - {lang.language}: {lang.file_count} files")
```

### Phase 2: Check Current Status

```python
from lsp_setup import StatusTracker

# Get current LSP setup status
language_names = [lang.language for lang in languages]
tracker = StatusTracker(project_root, language_names)
status = tracker.get_full_status()

# Show status
print(tracker.generate_user_guidance())
```

### Phase 3: Configure LSP (If Needed)

```python
from lsp_setup import LSPConfigurator

# Configure .env file
configurator = LSPConfigurator(project_root)

# Enable LSP
if not configurator.is_lsp_enabled():
    configurator.enable_lsp()
    print("✓ Enabled LSP in .env")
```

### Phase 4: Install Plugins (If Needed)

```python
from lsp_setup import PluginManager

# Install Claude Code plugins for detected languages
manager = PluginManager()

# Check prerequisites
if not manager.check_npx_available():
    print("⚠ npx not found. Install Node.js first:")
    print("  macOS: brew install node")
    print("  Linux: sudo apt install nodejs")
    exit(1)

# Install plugins for languages with missing Layer 2
for lang_name in language_names:
    layer_2_status = status["layer_2"][lang_name]
    if not layer_2_status["installed"]:
        print(f"Installing {lang_name} plugin...")
        success = manager.install_plugin(lang_name)
        if success:
            print(f"✓ {lang_name} plugin installed")
        else:
            print(f"✗ Failed to install {lang_name} plugin")
            print(f"  {layer_2_status.get('install_guide', 'See docs')}")
```

### Phase 5: Final Status Report

```python
# Recheck status after installation
final_status = tracker.get_full_status()

if final_status["overall_ready"]:
    print("\n✅ LSP setup complete! All layers configured.")
else:
    print("\n⚠ LSP partially configured. Next steps:")
    print(tracker.generate_user_guidance())
```

### Command-Line Arguments (Optional)

Support these arguments if provided by user:

- `--status-only`: Skip installation, just report current status
- `--force`: Reinstall all plugins even if already installed
- `--languages <lang1,lang2>`: Configure only specific languages
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be done without making changes
