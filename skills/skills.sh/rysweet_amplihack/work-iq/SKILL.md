# Work IQ Skill

Query your Microsoft 365 workspace using natural language. Search emails, meetings, Teams messages, and documents without leaving your development environment.

## Quick Start

### 0. Enable MCP Server (Required First)

The workiq MCP server is **disabled by default**. Enable it before use:

```
/mcp-manager
```

Select the `workiq` server and enable it, or manually set `"disabled": false` in `.mcp.json`.

### 1. Accept EULA (Required First)

```bash
npx @microsoft/workiq accept-eula
```

### 2. Configure MCP

Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workiq": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@microsoft/workiq", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Authenticate

First query triggers M365 authentication - a browser window opens for sign-in.

### 4. Start Querying

```
"What meetings do I have tomorrow?"
"Find emails from Sarah about the budget"
"Show Teams messages about the deployment"
```

## Core Capabilities

### Email Intelligence

- Find emails by sender, recipient, subject, or content
- Filter by date ranges
- Search across inbox, sent items, and archives

**Example:** `"What did John say about the proposal?"`

### Calendar & Meetings

- View upcoming meetings
- Search past meetings by title or attendees
- Check your schedule

**Example:** `"What's on my calendar this week?"`

### Teams Messages

- Search conversations across channels
- Find messages by sender or content
- Locate shared files

**Example:** `"Summarize today's messages in Engineering channel"`

### Document Search

- Query SharePoint and OneDrive content
- Search by file type, author, or content
- Find recently modified documents

**Example:** `"Find my recent PowerPoint presentations"`
