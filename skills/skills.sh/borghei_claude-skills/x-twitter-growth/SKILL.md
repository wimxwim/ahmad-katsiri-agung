# X/Twitter Growth Skill

## Overview

Production-ready X/Twitter growth toolkit for analyzing tweet performance patterns, structuring optimal threads, and tracking engagement metrics. Designed for creators, marketers, and brand accounts looking to grow audience and engagement systematically through data-driven content decisions.

## Clarify First

Before generating, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Deliverable** — content performance audit, thread building, or growth review — selects which tool runs
- [ ] **Data or source content** — exported tweet/analytics CSV (for audits) or the long-form draft (for threads) — required input for the chosen tool
- [ ] **Niche & audience** — the one topic and who you're growing — shapes the hook and content pillars
- [ ] **Growth goal** — followers, engagement, or replies — sets which benchmark and CTA to optimize for

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze tweet performance patterns from exported data
python scripts/tweet_analyzer.py tweets.csv

# Structure long-form content into optimal Twitter threads
python scripts/thread_builder.py content.txt --target-tweets 8

# Track follower growth, engagement rates, and best posting times
python scripts/growth_tracker.py analytics.csv --period monthly
```

## Tools Overview

| Tool | Purpose | Input | Output |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| `tweet_analyzer.py` | Performance pattern analysis | CSV with tweet data | Engagement patterns + insights |
| `thread_builder.py` | Thread structuring | Text file or JSON | Formatted thread + hooks |
| `growth_tracker.py` | Growth & engagement tracking | CSV with analytics data | Growth report + best times |

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Content Performance Audit

1. Export tweet data from X Analytics or third-party tool as CSV
2. Run `tweet_analyzer.py` to identify top-performing patterns
3. Identify which content types, formats, and topics drive engagement
4. Use insights to refine content strategy and posting schedule
5. Re-audit monthly to track improvement

### Workflow 2: Thread Creation Pipeline

1. Draft long-form content in text or markdown format
2. Run `thread_builder.py` to split into optimal thread structure
3. Review hook tweet (tweet 1) for maximum engagement potential
4. Add call-to-action and engagement hooks per recommendations
5. Schedule using identified best posting times from `growth_tracker.py`

### Workflow 3: Monthly Growth Review

1. Export analytics data for the period
2. Run `growth_tracker.py --period monthly` for growth metrics
3. Run `tweet_analyzer.py` on the same period for content insights
4. Compare engagement rates to prior period
5. Identify top 5 tweets and extract replicable patterns

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Tweet Data CSV Format
```csv
tweet_id,text,created_at,impressions,engagements,likes,retweets,replies,type,has_media
T001,"Here's what I learned...",2025-06-15 09:30:00,15000,850,320,95,45,thread_start,no
T002,"Check out this chart",2025-06-14 14:00:00,8500,420,180,35,22,single,yes
```

### Pattern: Thread Content Input

### Engagement Rate Benchmarks

| Metric | Low | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|-----|---------|------|-----------|
| Engagement Rate | < 1% | 1-3% | 3-6% | > 6% |
| Reply Rate | < 0.1% | 0.1-0.5% | 0.5-1% | > 1% |
| Retweet Rate | < 0.2% | 0.2-1% | 1-3% | > 3% |
| Thread Completion | < 20% | 20-40% | 40-60% | > 60% |
