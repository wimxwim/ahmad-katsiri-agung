## Clarify First

Before reviewing the contract, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Which side you represent** — customer/buyer vs vendor/provider flips which clauses are favorable and reverses the direction of every redline
- [ ] **Contract type** — SaaS, services, vendor/supply, or license — sets the standard-clause baseline and which missing clauses get flagged
- [ ] **Risk tolerance / playbook positions** — what your org treats as a deal-breaker — defines the RED vs YELLOW cutoff and the Must-Have vs Nice-to-Have tiering
- [ ] **Deal leverage / value** — calibrates which redlines are walkaway (Tier 1) vs tradeable concessions (Tier 3)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the review.

## Tools

### Contract Analyzer

Analyzes contract text files for clause types, missing standard clauses, and risk indicators.

```bash
# Analyze a contract file
python scripts/contract_analyzer.py contract.txt

# JSON output for pipeline integration
python scripts/contract_analyzer.py agreement.md --json

# Save analysis to file
python scripts/contract_analyzer.py contract.txt --output analysis.json --json
```

**What it detects:**
- Clause types: Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, IP, Data Protection, Term & Termination, Governing Law, Reps & Warranties, Force Majeure, Confidentiality, Payment Terms
- Missing standard clauses against a baseline checklist
- Risk indicators: uncapped liability, perpetual terms, unilateral indemnification, automatic renewal without opt-out, broad IP assignment, unlimited audit rights

**Risk Classification:**

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| RED | Deal-breaker risk | Must negotiate before signing |
| YELLOW | Material concern | Should negotiate, may accept with mitigation |
| GREEN | Standard or favorable | Acceptable as-is |

---

### Redline Generator

Takes contract analysis JSON and generates formatted redline suggestions with priority tiers.

```bash
# Generate redlines from analysis
python scripts/contract_analyzer.py contract.txt --json --output analysis.json
python scripts/redline_generator.py analysis.json

# JSON output
python scripts/redline_generator.py analysis.json --json

# Save redlines to file
python scripts/redline_generator.py analysis.json --output redlines.md
```

**Output includes:**
- Priority tier (Must-Have / Should-Have / Nice-to-Have)
- Preferred redline language
- Rationale for each change
- Fallback position if counterparty rejects
- Negotiation notes

**Priority Tiers:**

| Tier | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Must-Have | Deal-breakers; walk away if rejected |
| 2 | Should-Have | Strong preferences; push hard but negotiable |
| 3 | Nice-to-Have | Concession candidates; trade for Tier 1-2 wins |

- Representations & Warranties
- Force Majeure

### Negotiation Playbook
`references/negotiation_playbook.md`

Negotiation priority framework with:
- Tier 1 deal-breakers and walkaway criteria

## Workflows

### Standard Contract Review

1. **Ingest** -- Save contract as `.txt` or `.md` file
2. **Analyze** -- Run `contract_analyzer.py` with `--json` flag
3. **Review findings** -- Check RED items first, then YELLOW
4. **Generate redlines** -- Run `redline_generator.py` on analysis output
5. **Prioritize** -- Focus on Must-Have redlines, prepare fallbacks for Should-Have
6. **Send to counsel** -- Attach analysis and redlines for final review

### Rapid Risk Triage

1. Run `contract_analyzer.py` in text mode for quick scan
2. If any RED findings: escalate immediately to legal counsel
3. If YELLOW only: schedule review within 48 hours
4. If all GREEN: proceed with standard approval workflow

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `Error: File not found` | Contract file path is incorrect or file does not exist | Verify the file path; use absolute paths if relative paths fail |
| No clauses detected | Contract uses unusual formatting or non-standard clause headers | Ensure contract is plain text; strip PDF artifacts before analysis |
| All clauses marked GREEN | Contract is genuinely favorable, or text extraction missed key sections | Manually verify critical clauses (liability, indemnification, IP) are present in the input file |
| Redline generator produces empty output | Analysis JSON has no YELLOW or RED findings | Confirm analysis JSON is valid; re-run analyzer if contract was updated |
| False positive on uncapped liability | Liability section references a cap elsewhere in the document | Review the full Limitation of Liability section; the tool scans for cap keywords within each clause boundary |
| Missing clause false positive | Clause exists but uses non-standard heading (e.g., "Damages Cap" instead of "Limitation of Liability") | The analyzer checks multiple heading variants; add custom aliases if your organization uses unique terminology |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Contract review time reduced by 50%:** Automated clause identification and risk classification eliminates manual scanning.
- **Zero missed RED-severity clauses:** Every uncapped liability, unilateral indemnification, and broad IP assignment is flagged before human review.
- **Redline generation under 2 minutes:** From analysis JSON to prioritized redline document.
- **Consistent risk classification across reviewers:** GREEN/YELLOW/RED framework eliminates subjective assessments.
- **100% of contracts reviewed with structured output:** Every agreement gets a clause inventory and risk report before negotiation begins.
- **Negotiation success rate above 80% on Must-Have items:** Tier 1 redlines with prepared fallbacks improve negotiation outcomes.

---

## Scope & Limitations

**Covers:**
- Static text analysis of contract clauses using keyword and pattern matching
- Clause type identification across 10+ standard commercial contract categories
- Risk indicator detection: uncapped liability, perpetual terms, unilateral obligations, auto-renewal traps
- Missing clause detection against a standard commercial contract baseline
- Prioritized redline generation with fallback positions

**Does NOT cover:**
- **Legal advice** -- this tool supports review, it does not replace qualified legal counsel
- **Jurisdiction-specific compliance** -- use `ra-qm-team` skills for regulatory compliance (GDPR, SOC 2, etc.)
- **Contract execution or e-signature workflows** -- out of scope
- **Multi-document cross-reference** (e.g., checking SOW against MSA) -- analyze each document separately
- **Non-English contracts** -- pattern matching is English-language only

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Signing contracts with only GREEN findings and no human review | Automated analysis cannot catch context-dependent risks, ambiguous language, or business-specific concerns | Always have qualified counsel review before execution, even on all-GREEN contracts |
| Treating all RED findings as equal | Some RED items are structural deal-breakers while others may be resolvable with a single word change | Use the redline generator to assess effort and fallback positions for each RED finding |
| Skipping the redline fallback positions | Entering negotiation with only preferred positions leaves no room for strategic concession | Always prepare Must-Have fallbacks and identify Nice-to-Have items to trade away |
| Running analysis on poorly extracted text | PDF-to-text conversion artifacts break clause detection patterns | Clean the text file before analysis: remove headers, footers, page numbers, and formatting artifacts |

REDLINE SUGGESTIONS
===================

[MUST-HAVE] Limitation of Liability — Uncapped Liability
  Severity: RED
  Preferred: "Aggregate liability shall not exceed 12 months of fees paid."
  Rationale: Uncapped liability creates unlimited financial exposure.
  Fallback: "Aggregate liability shall not exceed 24 months of fees paid."

[SHOULD-HAVE] Indemnification — Unilateral Indemnification
  Severity: YELLOW
  Preferred: "Each party shall indemnify the other for breaches of this Agreement."
  Rationale: Mutual indemnification balances risk between parties.
  Fallback: "Indemnification obligations shall be subject to the liability cap."
```
