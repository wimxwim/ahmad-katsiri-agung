# ISMS Audit Expert

Internal and external ISMS audit management for ISO 27001 compliance verification, security control assessment, and certification support.

---

## Clarify First

Before planning or executing the audit, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Audit type** — internal annual, Stage 1, Stage 2, surveillance, or recertification (sets the scope and checklist depth)
- [ ] **Controls in scope** — which Annex A controls / SoA coverage for this engagement (drives the schedule and testing)
- [ ] **Risk ratings and prior findings** — per-control risk and outstanding nonconformities (picks audit frequency and sample size)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the audit plan.

## Audit Program Management

### Risk-Based Audit Schedule

| Risk Level | Audit Frequency | Examples |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Critical | Quarterly | Privileged access, vulnerability management, logging |
| High | Semi-annual | Access control, incident response, encryption |
| Medium | Annual | Policies, awareness training, physical security |
| Low | Annual | Documentation, asset inventory |

### Workflow: Annual Audit Planning

1. **Review prior audit results** -- analyze previous findings, open items, and risk assessment outputs from the most recent cycle.
2. **Identify high-risk controls** -- flag controls involved in recent security incidents or with outstanding nonconformities.
3. **Determine audit scope** -- define ISMS boundaries, confirm Statement of Applicability (SoA) coverage for the certification cycle.
4. **Assign auditors** -- ensure independence from audited areas; verify auditor competency (ISO 27001 Lead Auditor certification preferred).
5. **Create audit schedule** -- allocate resources, assign dates, and distribute across the year by risk priority.
6. **Obtain management approval** for the finalized audit plan.
7. **Validation checkpoint:** Audit plan covers all 93 Annex A controls within the certification cycle; schedule approved by management; auditor independence confirmed.

### Example: Annual Audit Plan Output

## Audit Execution

### Workflow: Pre-Audit Preparation

1. **Review ISMS documentation** -- policies, Statement of Applicability, risk assessment, and risk treatment plan.
2. **Analyze previous audit reports** -- note open findings and areas requiring follow-up.
3. **Prepare audit plan** -- define interview schedule, control sample, and evidence requirements.
4. **Notify auditees** -- communicate scope, timing, and documentation needed at least 2 weeks in advance.
5. **Prepare control-specific checklists** for all controls in scope.
6. **Validation checkpoint:** All documentation received and reviewed before the opening meeting.

### Workflow: Audit Conduct

1. **Opening Meeting** -- confirm scope, introduce audit team, agree on communication channels and logistics.
2. **Evidence Collection** -- interview control owners, review documentation and records, observe processes in operation, inspect technical configurations.
3. **Control Verification** -- test control design (does it address the risk?), test control operation (is it working as intended?), sample transactions and records, document all evidence.
4. **Closing Meeting** -- present preliminary findings, clarify factual inaccuracies, agree on finding classification, confirm corrective action timelines.
5. **Validation checkpoint:** All controls in scope assessed with documented evidence; findings classified and communicated.

### Evidence Collection Methods

| Method | Use Case | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Inquiry | Process understanding | Interview Security Manager about incident response |
| Observation | Operational verification | Watch visitor sign-in process at reception |
| Inspection | Documentation review | Check access approval records for last quarter |
| Re-performance | Control testing | Attempt login with weak password to verify policy enforcement |

---

## Control Assessment

### ISO 27002 Control Categories

**Organizational Controls (A.5):** Information security policies, roles and responsibilities, segregation of duties, contact with authorities, threat intelligence, information security in projects.

**People Controls (A.6):** Screening and background checks, employment terms, security awareness and training, disciplinary process, remote working security.

**Physical Controls (A.7):** Physical security perimeters, entry controls, securing offices and facilities, physical security monitoring, equipment protection.

**Technological Controls (A.8):** User endpoint devices, privileged access rights, access restriction, secure authentication, malware protection, vulnerability management, backup and recovery, logging and monitoring, network security, cryptography.

### Workflow: Control Testing

1. **Identify control objective** from the relevant ISO 27002 clause.
2. **Determine testing method** -- inquiry, observation, inspection, or re-performance based on control type.
3. **Define sample size** -- base on population size and risk level (e.g., 25 samples for quarterly access reviews, 5 for annual policy reviews).
4. **Execute test** and document results with specific evidence references.
5. **Evaluate control effectiveness** -- effective, partially effective, or ineffective.
6. **Validation checkpoint:** Evidence supports conclusion; finding documented if control is not fully effective.

### Example: Control Test Working Paper

```
CONTROL TEST WORKING PAPER

Control: A.8.2 - Privileged access rights
Objective: Privileged access is restricted and managed
Test date: 2026-03-10
Auditor: J. Smith

Test procedure:
  1. Obtained list of privileged accounts from IAM system (42 accounts)
  2. Selected sample of 10 accounts (25% sample rate)
  3. For each account, verified:
     - Documented business justification exists
     - Manager approval on file
     - Quarterly access review completed
     - No dormant accounts (last login within 90 days)

Results:
  - 8/10 accounts: All criteria met (PASS)
  - 1/10: Missing quarterly review for Q4 2025 (MINOR NC)
  - 1/10: No documented business justification (MINOR NC)

Conclusion: Control partially effective - minor nonconformity raised
Finding reference: ISMS-2026-007
```

## Finding Management

### Finding Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Major Nonconformity | Control failure creating significant risk | 30 days |
| Minor Nonconformity | Isolated deviation with limited impact | 90 days |
| Observation | Improvement opportunity | Next audit cycle |

### Finding Documentation Template

```
Finding ID: ISMS-2026-007
Control Reference: A.8.2 - Privileged access rights
Severity: Minor Nonconformity

Evidence:
- 1 of 10 sampled privileged accounts missing Q4 2025 review
- 1 of 10 sampled accounts lacks documented business justification
- Screenshots of IAM records and review log exported 2026-03-10

Risk Impact:
- Unreviewed privileged access increases insider threat exposure
- Non-justified accounts may represent unnecessary attack surface

Root Cause:
- Access review process relies on manual tracking; no automated reminder

Recommendation:
- Implement automated quarterly review reminders via IAM platform
- Require business justification field as mandatory in provisioning workflow
- Backfill missing reviews within 14 days
```

### Workflow: Corrective Action

1. **Auditee acknowledges** finding and severity classification.
2. **Root cause analysis** completed within 10 business days.
3. **Corrective action plan** submitted with target dates and responsible owners.
4. **Actions implemented** by responsible parties per the plan.
5. **Auditor verifies effectiveness** -- re-tests control with fresh evidence.
6. **Finding closed** with documented evidence of resolution.
7. **Validation checkpoint:** Root cause addressed; recurrence prevented; evidence of effective correction on file.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Audit plan does not cover all 93 Annex A controls within the certification cycle | Controls not inventoried against the 2022 four-theme structure or risk-based scheduling gaps | Use `isms_audit_scheduler.py` with a complete controls CSV covering all 93 controls; ensure the 3-year cycle allocates quarterly audits for critical controls and annual coverage for all others |
| Major nonconformity found during certification audit | Systemic control failure or complete absence of a required ISMS element | Conduct immediate root cause analysis; develop corrective action plan with 30-day target; re-test the control with fresh evidence; schedule verification audit with certification body |
| Auditor independence challenged by certification body | Internal auditors assigned to areas they manage or operate | Establish clear auditor independence policy; never assign auditors to areas they are responsible for; consider external consultants for high-risk control areas; document independence verification for each audit |
| Evidence collection incomplete for technological controls (A.8) | Technical configurations not captured, logs not retained, or screenshots not timestamped | Prepare control-specific evidence checklists before audit; request system administrators to export configurations; ensure log retention covers the audit period; timestamp all evidence artifacts |
| Finding closure rate below 90% target | Corrective actions not prioritized, unclear ownership, or insufficient follow-up | Assign specific owners with due dates for every finding; implement automated tracking with escalation at 50% and 75% of SLA; conduct monthly corrective action reviews |
| Surveillance audit identifies regression in previously passed controls | Controls degraded after initial certification due to staff changes, system updates, or process drift | Implement continuous compliance monitoring (not just annual checks); schedule monthly control spot-checks for high-risk areas; include control effectiveness in management review |
| Sample-based testing misses systemic issues | Sample size too small or selection biased toward known-good records | Calculate sample size based on population and risk level (minimum 25 for quarterly reviews); use random selection methods; increase sample for areas with prior findings |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Audit plan completion rate of 100%** -- all scheduled audits executed within the planned quarter, with no deferrals or cancellations without management approval
- **Zero major nonconformities at certification/surveillance audits** -- all systemic control failures identified and corrected during internal audits before external assessment
- **Finding closure rate above 90% within SLA** -- major nonconformities closed within 30 days, minor within 90 days, observations addressed by next audit cycle
- **All 93 Annex A controls audited within the 3-year certification cycle** -- with critical controls (A.8.2, A.8.5, A.8.8, A.8.15) audited quarterly and high-risk controls semi-annually
- **Audit evidence documented with specific references** -- every finding includes control reference, evidence type (inquiry/observation/inspection/re-performance), sample details, and conclusion
- **Auditor competency verified** -- all assigned auditors have ISO 27001 Lead Auditor certification or equivalent, with independence confirmed for each audit engagement

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- Risk-based annual audit planning and scheduling across all 93 ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls
- Audit execution workflows including pre-audit preparation, evidence collection, control testing, and closing meetings
- Finding management with severity classification (Major NC, Minor NC, Observation) and corrective action tracking
- Certification support for Stage 1 (documentation review) and Stage 2 (implementation effectiveness) audits
- Surveillance audit preparation and recertification planning
- Control-specific testing procedures for organizational, people, physical, and technological control themes
- Audit performance metrics and KPI tracking

**Out of Scope:**
- Actual certification body selection, engagement, or fee negotiation
- Technical penetration testing or vulnerability scanning -- use `infrastructure-compliance-auditor` for technical checks
- ISO 27001 ISMS implementation -- use `information-security-manager-iso27001` for implementation guidance
- SOC 2 or other framework-specific audit execution beyond ISO 27001 cross-reference
- Legal or contractual advice on audit findings or regulatory reporting obligations

**Important Notes:**
- ISO 27001:2013 certifications expired after October 2025; all audits must now conform to the 2022 edition with 93 controls across 4 themes
- 81% of organizations are pursuing ISO 27001 certification as of 2025 (up from 67% in 2024), reflecting heightened market demand for certified security programs
- Best practice is to embed ISMS audit findings into continuous improvement rather than treating audits as periodic compliance events

## Integration Points

| Skill | Integration | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `information-security-manager-iso27001` | ISMS implementation provides the controls and documentation that audits assess | When audit findings require control improvements or ISMS enhancements |
| `infrastructure-compliance-auditor` | Technical infrastructure checks provide audit evidence for Annex A technological controls | When audit requires evidence of A.8 technological control implementation |
| `soc2-compliance-expert` | SOC 2 audit evidence and Trust Services Criteria overlap with ISO 27001 controls | When organization maintains both ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliance programs |
| `capa-officer` | Audit findings requiring formal corrective action feed into CAPA process | When major nonconformities require structured root cause analysis and corrective action |
