# Signup Flow CRO

Production-grade signup and registration optimization framework covering authentication strategy, field reduction methodology, multi-step flow architecture, SSO implementation, progressive profiling, credit card requirement analysis, post-submit experience design, and mobile-specific registration patterns. For post-signup onboarding, use onboarding-cro. For lead capture forms (not account creation), use form-cro.

## Clarify First

Before optimizing the signup flow, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Flow type** — free trial, freemium, paid, or waitlist (determines friction tolerance and minimum field set)
- [ ] **B2B or B2C** — B2B tolerates more fields; B2C needs minimal friction (sets SSO priority and field count)
- [ ] **Current fields + completion rate + drop-off** — baseline and the friction point to cut (each removed field ~+10%)
- [ ] **Data truly needed before first product use** — separates must-have fields from those to defer or enrich (the "Before First Use" test)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the audit.

## Initial Assessment

### Required Context

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Flow type? (free trial, freemium, paid, waitlist) | Determines friction tolerance |
| B2B or B2C? | B2B tolerates more fields, B2C needs minimal friction |
| How many steps/screens currently? | Baseline for optimization |
| What fields are required? | Identifies reduction opportunities |
| Current completion rate? | Benchmark for improvement |
| Where do users drop off? (field-level data) | Pinpoints specific friction |
| What data is needed before first product use? | Separates must-have from nice-to-have |
| What compliance requirements exist? | Constrains what can be deferred |

---

## Authentication Strategy

### Authentication Methods Ranked by Friction

| Method | Friction Level | Best For | Conversion Impact |
|--------|---------------|----------|------------------|
| Google SSO (one-click) | Very low | B2B SaaS, productivity tools | +15-30% vs email+password |
| Apple Sign In | Very low | iOS/Mac-heavy audience | +10-20% on Apple devices |
| Microsoft SSO | Low | Enterprise B2B | +10-15% for enterprise |
| GitHub SSO | Low | Developer tools | +15-25% for dev audience |
| Magic link (email) | Low | Security-conscious, B2B | +5-10% vs password |
| Email + password | Medium | Universal fallback | Baseline |
| Phone + OTP | Medium | Mobile-first, B2C | Varies by market |
| Email + password + verification | High | When verification is required | -10-20% vs no verification |

### SSO Strategy Decision

| Your Audience | Primary SSO | Secondary SSO | Keep Email+Password? |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| B2B SaaS (general) | Google Workspace | Microsoft | Yes |
| Developer tools | GitHub | Google | Yes |
| Enterprise | Microsoft/Okta | Google | Yes (for personal evals) |
| B2C consumer | Google | Apple | Yes |
| Mobile-first | Apple / Google | Phone OTP | Optional |
| Privacy-focused | Magic link | Email+password | Yes |

### SSO Placement

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Create your account             │
│                                  │
│  [Continue with Google]          │  ← SSO options first
│  [Continue with Microsoft]       │
│                                  │
│  ──── or ────                   │  ← Visual separator
│                                  │
│  Email: [_______________]       │  ← Email+password as alternative
│  Password: [_______________]    │
│                                  │
│  [Create Account]               │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rules:**
- SSO buttons above the email form (not below)
- Use branded button styles (Google's official button, etc.)
- "or" divider between SSO and email options
- SSO reduces fields to zero (name and email come from the provider)

## Field Reduction Methodology

### The "Before First Use" Test

For every field, ask: **Does the product literally not function without this data?**

| Field | Passes Test? | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Email | Yes (account identity) | Keep |
| Password | Yes (account security) | Keep (or use SSO/magic link) |
| First name | Usually no | Defer to onboarding or profile |
| Last name | No | Defer or drop entirely |
| Company name | Usually no | Enrich from email domain |
| Phone number | Rarely | Defer unless SMS verification required |
| Job title | No | Defer to onboarding or enrich |
| Team size | No | Defer to onboarding |
| How did you hear about us? | Never | Post-signup survey or attribution |
| Industry | No | Enrich from company data |

### Enrichment Sources

| Field | Enrichment Method | Timing |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Company name | Email domain lookup (Clearbit, Apollo) | Immediately post-signup |
| Company size | Company data API | Immediately post-signup |
| Industry | Company data API | Immediately post-signup |
| Job title | LinkedIn API or manual CSM research | Before first sales contact |
| Location | IP geolocation | On signup |

### Minimum Viable Field Sets

| Signup Type | Minimum Fields | Additional (if needed) |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Freemium | Email only (or SSO) | -- |
| Free trial (product-led) | Email + Password (or SSO) | -- |
| Free trial (sales-assisted) | Email + Password + Company | + Role (for routing) |
| Paid signup | Email + Password + Payment | -- |
| Waitlist | Email | + One qualifying question |
| Enterprise trial | Email + Company + Role | + Team size (for provisioning) |

---

## Multi-Step Flow Architecture

### When to Use Multi-Step

| Condition | Single-Step | Multi-Step |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Total fields | 1-4 | 5+ |
| Need to qualify/route | No | Yes |
| Product needs configuration | No | Yes |
| B2B with team setup | No | Yes |

### Step Design

**Step 1: Account Creation (lowest friction)**
- Email + Password (or SSO)
- NOTHING else on this step
- This is where 60%+ of abandonment happens if overloaded

**Step 2: Personalization (if needed)**
- Role / goal / use case selection
- This personalizes their product experience
- Skip button available ("Set up later")

**Step 3: Configuration (if needed)**
- Team invite, integration connect, data import
- Each sub-step is optional with "Skip for now"
- Show value of completing each ("Invite your team to collaborate")

### Progress Design

- Show step count: "Step 1 of 3"
- Show progress bar
- Label each step descriptively: "Create Account", "Your Role", "Your Team"
- Allow back navigation (preserve entered data)
- Never reset the form on back navigation or browser back button

---

## Credit Card Requirement Analysis

### Decision Framework

| Factor | Require CC | Do Not Require CC |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Trial conversion goal | > 60% trial-to-paid | > 30% trial-to-paid with higher volume |
| Product complexity | Simple, immediate value | Complex, needs exploration |
| ACV | > $100/month | < $100/month |
| Sales motion | Product-led | Sales-assisted |
| Competitor practice | Competitors require CC | Competitors offer CC-free trial |
| Target audience | Enterprise (committed buyers) | SMB/prosumer (browsers) |

### Impact Analysis

| Approach | Signup Volume | Trial Quality | Trial-to-Paid | Net Revenue |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| No CC required | Higher (+40-80%) | Lower (more tire-kickers) | Lower (2-15%) | Often higher net |
| CC required | Lower | Higher (committed) | Higher (40-70%) | Depends on volume |
| CC with "$0 charge" | Middle | Middle | Middle (20-40%) | Middle |

### Recommendation Framework

**Default to no CC required** unless:
1. Your product delivers immediate, obvious value (no learning curve)
2. Your trial-to-paid with CC is > 50%
3. You have a high-touch sales team to handle lower volume
4. Support costs for free trials are unsustainable

**If requiring CC:** Display prominently:
- "You won't be charged until [date]"
- "Cancel anytime before [date]"
- "We'll email you 3 days before your trial ends"

---

## Post-Submit Experience

### Immediately After Signup

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Auto-login | Log the user in immediately (never force a separate login) |
| Welcome screen | Show a clear next step, not a blank dashboard |
| Confirmation email | Send immediately, include: what to expect, key features, support contact |
| Email verification | Defer if possible. If required, send inline and let them continue using the product before verifying |

### Email Verification Strategy

| Approach | Impact on Activation | When to Use |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| No verification | Best activation rate | Low-risk products, freemium |
| Verify to unlock specific feature | Good -- users activate first | B2B SaaS with free tier |
| Verify within 24 hours | Moderate -- creates urgency | Products that send emails |
| Verify before any use | Worst activation rate | Regulated industries, financial products |

**Default recommendation:** Let users use the product immediately. Verify within 24-48 hours. Gate only the features that require a verified email (e.g., sending emails, team invites).

---

## Mobile Signup Optimization

### Mobile-Specific Rules

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|---------------|
| SSO first | Google/Apple Sign In is one tap on mobile |
| One column | Never use side-by-side fields on mobile |
| Large inputs | Minimum 44px height for all touch targets |
| Appropriate keyboards | `type="email"`, `type="tel"`, `type="password"` |
| Auto-fill support | Use standard field names for browser auto-fill |
| Sticky CTA | Pin "Create Account" button to bottom of viewport |
| No CAPTCHA | Use invisible reCAPTCHA or alternatives |
| Password visibility | Toggle to show/hide password |

### Mobile vs Desktop Signup Differences

| Aspect | Desktop | Mobile |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Primary auth | SSO or Email+Password | SSO preferred (one-tap) |
| Fields per screen | Up to 5 | Max 3 |
| Password rules | Show requirements upfront | Show on interaction |
| CAPTCHA | Standard reCAPTCHA acceptable | Invisible or none |
| Social proof | Sidebar or adjacent | Below form or above |

---

## Signup Flow Patterns by Product Type

### B2B SaaS Trial

```
[Google SSO] or [Email + Password]
→ Auto-login to product
→ Welcome screen: "What brings you here?" (3 options)
→ Guided first action based on selection
→ Team invite prompt (optional, day 2-3)
```

### B2C Consumer App

```
[Apple Sign In] or [Google Sign In] or [Email]
→ Immediately into product
→ Personalization (follows, preferences) inline
→ Profile completion deferred
```

### Enterprise/Sales-Assisted

```
[Work Email + Password + Company Name]
→ Auto-login to sandbox
→ Role + team size (for provisioning)
→ CSM outreach triggered for qualified accounts
→ Guided setup with dedicated support
```

### Waitlist / Early Access

```
[Email only]
→ Confirmation page: position in waitlist
→ Referral mechanism: "Jump ahead by sharing"
→ Weekly update email on progress
→ Access granted email with one-click activation
```

---

## Progressive Profiling

Collect information over multiple sessions instead of one long form.

### Progressive Profiling Schedule

| Session | What to Collect | How |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Signup (session 1) | Email + auth | Signup form |
| First use (session 1-2) | Role, primary goal | In-product prompt or setup wizard |
| Day 3-5 | Team size, use case | Contextual question in product |
| Day 7-14 | Industry, company size | Survey or enrichment |
| Before first payment | Billing info | Upgrade flow |

### Implementation Rules

- Each profiling touchpoint asks 1-2 questions maximum
- Always explain why you are asking ("So we can personalize your experience")
- Always provide a "Skip" option
- Never ask for information you can enrich automatically
- Store partial profiles and build over time

---

## Error and Edge Case Handling

### Password Requirements

| Approach | User Experience | Security |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Show requirements upfront | Best -- user knows what to enter | Good |
| Show requirements on focus | Good | Good |
| Show errors only after submit | Bad -- frustrating | Same |
| Real-time checkmarks | Best -- progressive validation | Good |

**Recommended:** Show password requirements as a checklist that checks off in real-time as the user types.

### Common Error Scenarios

| Error | Bad UX | Good UX |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Email already registered | "Error: account exists" | "This email already has an account. [Log in] or [Reset password]" |
| Weak password | "Password too weak" | Checkmarks showing which requirements are met/unmet |
| SSO failure | Generic error page | "Something went wrong with Google login. [Try again] or [Use email instead]" |
| Network error | Form clears, no message | "Connection issue. Your data is saved. [Try again]" |
| Rate limiting | Blocked with no explanation | "Too many attempts. Please try again in [N] minutes" |

---

## A/B Test Framework

### High-Impact Tests

| Test | Hypothesis | Metric |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Add Google SSO | SSO increases completion by 15-30% | Signup completion rate |
| Remove non-essential fields | Fewer fields = higher completion | Completion rate + activation rate |
| Single-step vs multi-step | Multi-step feels easier for 5+ field forms | Completion rate |
| CC required vs not | No CC increases volume enough to offset lower conversion | Net revenue |
| Defer email verification | Immediate product access increases activation | Activation rate |

### Measurement Rules

- Track signup completion rate AND downstream activation rate
- A test that increases signups but decreases activation is not a win
- Track by traffic source (paid vs organic may respond differently)
- Track mobile and desktop separately

---

## Metrics and Benchmarks

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Signup page visit-to-completion | Completions / Page views | 30-50% (B2B), 40-60% (B2C) |
| SSO adoption rate | SSO signups / Total signups | 30-60% when offered |
| Field-level drop-off | Abandonment per field | Identify highest-drop field |
| Time to complete | Median seconds from first interaction to submit | < 45s for simple, < 2min for multi-step |
| Mobile completion rate | Mobile completions / Mobile page views | Should be within 15% of desktop |
| Email verification rate | Verified / Total signups | > 70% within 48 hours |

## Tool Reference

### 1. signup_field_auditor.py

Audits a signup form configuration for unnecessary fields, missing enrichment opportunities, and friction points. Evaluates each field against the "Before First Use" test and recommends which to keep, defer, or enrich.

```bash
python scripts/signup_field_auditor.py fields.json --format text
python scripts/signup_field_auditor.py fields.json --format json
```

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `fields.json` | positional | Path to JSON file with form field configuration |
| `--format` | optional | Output format: `text` (default) or `json` |

### 2. signup_flow_scorer.py

Scores a complete signup flow against conversion best practices. Evaluates SSO availability, field count, step count, mobile optimization, error handling, and post-submit experience. Outputs a 0-100 score with itemized improvements.

```bash
python scripts/signup_flow_scorer.py flow.json --format text
python scripts/signup_flow_scorer.py flow.json --format json
```

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `flow.json` | positional | Path to JSON file with signup flow configuration |
| `--format` | optional | Output format: `text` (default) or `json` |

### 3. cc_requirement_analyzer.py

Analyzes whether to require a credit card for trial signup. Takes business metrics (ACV, trial-to-paid rate, support costs, competitors) and recommends CC-required, CC-free, or "$0 charge" approach with projected volume and revenue impact.

```bash
python scripts/cc_requirement_analyzer.py business.json --format text
python scripts/cc_requirement_analyzer.py business.json --format json
```

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `business.json` | positional | Path to JSON file with business metrics |
| `--format` | optional | Output format: `text` (default) or `json` |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Signup completion rate below 30% (B2B) or 40% (B2C) | Too many fields, no SSO option, or form on a separate page from the CTA | Reduce to email-only or SSO; keep form on the same page as the value proposition; each removed field improves conversion ~10% |
| SSO adoption rate below 30% when offered | SSO buttons placed below the email form, or wrong SSO providers for the audience | Move SSO buttons above the email form with "or" divider; match SSO to audience (Google for B2B, Apple for iOS users) |
| Mobile completion rate >15% below desktop | Form not optimized for touch (small inputs, wrong keyboard types, no auto-fill) | Ensure 44px min touch targets, use type="email"/type="tel", enable browser auto-fill, pin CTA to bottom of viewport |
| High drop-off on password field | Complex password requirements shown only after submission, or no password visibility toggle | Show requirements as real-time checklist, add show/hide toggle, consider magic link or SSO to eliminate password entirely |
| Email verification kills activation | Verification required before any product use blocks the critical first-session experience | Defer verification to 24-48 hours; allow product use immediately; gate only email-sending features behind verification |
| "Email already registered" errors are frequent | Users forget they have accounts; error message does not help them recover | Change error to "This email has an account. [Log in] or [Reset password]" with direct links |
| High abandonment on multi-step flows | Steps are not progressive, no progress indicator, or too many fields per step | Show step count and progress bar; limit step 1 to account creation only; add "Skip for now" on non-essential steps |

---

## Success Criteria

- Signup page visit-to-completion rate reaches 30-50% (B2B) or 40-60% (B2C) within 60 days of optimization
- SSO adoption reaches 30-60% of total signups when SSO is properly offered
- Median time-to-complete stays below 45 seconds for simple flows and below 2 minutes for multi-step
- Mobile completion rate falls within 15% of desktop completion rate
- Email verification rate exceeds 70% within 48 hours of signup
- Field-level drop-off analysis shows no single field causing >10% incremental abandonment
- Post-signup activation rate (first key action) improves alongside signup rate (not a vanity metric tradeoff)

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In scope:** Authentication strategy (SSO, magic link, email+password), field reduction methodology, multi-step flow architecture, credit card requirement analysis, post-submit experience design, mobile signup optimization, progressive profiling schedules, error and edge case handling, and A/B testing frameworks for registration flows.

**Out of scope:** Post-signup onboarding and activation (use onboarding-cro), non-registration forms like lead capture or contact forms (use form-cro), landing page conversion before the signup form (use page-cro), in-app upgrade and paywall flows (use paywall-upgrade-cro). Scripts operate on local data only -- no integrations with authentication providers (Auth0, Clerk, etc.) or analytics platforms.

**Limitations:** Conversion benchmarks are aggregate SaaS/app industry data and vary by vertical, price point, and audience. SSO adoption rates depend heavily on audience composition (developer audiences adopt GitHub SSO at 40%+, while SMB audiences may prefer email). Credit card requirement analysis is modeled on industry averages -- actual impact requires A/B testing in your specific context. Progressive profiling recommendations assume standard SaaS lifecycle stages.

---

## Integration Points

- **onboarding-cro** -- Signup flow ends at account creation; onboarding-cro picks up from first login through activation
- **form-cro** -- Field-level optimization principles (validation, keyboard types, error handling) apply to signup forms
- **page-cro** -- Landing page quality directly impacts signup form reach; optimize the page before optimizing the form
- **paywall-upgrade-cro** -- Trial signup configuration (CC-required, trial length) affects downstream upgrade flow design
- **pricing-strategy** -- Pricing model (freemium vs trial) determines signup flow type and field requirements
- **referral-program** -- Referred user signups should pre-fill referrer context and display incentive

---

## Related Skills

- **onboarding-cro** -- Use for post-signup activation optimization. Signup-flow-cro ends when the user has an account; onboarding-cro starts there.
- **form-cro** -- Use for non-signup forms (lead capture, contact, demo request). Different optimization framework than registration.
- **page-cro** -- Use when the landing page leading to signup is the bottleneck, not the signup form itself.
- **paywall-upgrade-cro** -- Use when the real challenge is converting free users to paid, not getting them to sign up.
