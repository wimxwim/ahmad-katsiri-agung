## Clarify First

Before classifying the device or analyzing gaps, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Device characteristics** — duration, invasiveness, body-system contact, and whether it is active/software (drives the Annex VIII classification)
- [ ] **Intended purpose** — the device's claimed clinical purpose (sets the applicable rule and clinical-evidence level)
- [ ] **Software/AI nature** — whether it is software as a medical device (MDCG 2019-11) or AI/ML (changes classification and the documentation set)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the classification.

## Device Classification Workflow

Classify device under MDR Annex VIII:

1. Identify device duration (transient, short-term, long-term)
2. Determine invasiveness level (non-invasive, body orifice, surgical)
3. Assess body system contact (CNS, cardiac, other)
4. Check if active device (energy dependent)
5. Apply classification rules 1-22
6. For software, apply MDCG 2019-11 algorithm
7. Document classification rationale
8. **Validation:** Classification confirmed with Notified Body

### Classification Matrix

| Factor | Class I | Class IIa | Class IIb | Class III |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Duration | Any | Short-term | Long-term | Long-term |
| Invasiveness | Non-invasive | Body orifice | Surgical | Implantable |
| System | Any | Non-critical | Critical organs | CNS/cardiac |
| Risk | Lowest | Low-medium | Medium-high | Highest |

### Software Classification (MDCG 2019-11)

| Information Use | Condition Severity | Class |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Informs decision | Non-serious | IIa |
| Informs decision | Serious | IIb |
| Drives/treats | Critical | III |

### Classification Examples

**Example 1: Absorbable Surgical Suture**
- Rule 8 (implantable, long-term)
- Duration: > 30 days (absorbed)
- Contact: General tissue
- Classification: **Class IIb**

**Example 2: AI Diagnostic Software**
- Rule 11 + MDCG 2019-11
- Function: Diagnoses serious condition
- Classification: **Class IIb**

**Example 3: Cardiac Pacemaker**
- Rule 8 (implantable)
- Contact: Central circulatory system
- Classification: **Class III**

| AI-assisted detection | Typically Class IIa-IIb (Rule 11) | Must demonstrate clinical performance per intended use |
| AI-driven diagnosis | Typically Class IIb-III (Rule 11) | Requires clinical investigation for novel indications |
| AI treatment optimization | Typically Class IIb-III (Rule 11 + specific rules) | Benefit-risk analysis must account for AI uncertainty |
| Continuously learning AI | Classification per highest risk output | Post-market monitoring must track algorithm evolution |

### AI/ML-Specific Technical Documentation

In addition to standard Annex II requirements, AI/ML devices must document:

| Section | Content | MDCG Reference |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Algorithm description | Architecture, training approach, feature engineering | MDCG 2019-11, IMDRF SaMD WG |
| Training data | Sources, demographics, size, labeling methodology, quality | MDCG 2020-1 (equivalence) |
| Validation methodology | Test dataset independence, performance metrics, subgroup analysis | Annex XIV |
| Clinical performance | Sensitivity, specificity, AUC, PPV, NPV per intended population | CER requirements |
| Change management | How algorithm updates are validated and deployed | GSPR 17 |
| Explainability | How the AI's output can be understood by intended users | GSPR 23 (labeling) |

### EU AI Act Interaction with MDR

| EU AI Act Requirement | MDR Equivalent | Combined Approach |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| High-risk classification (Annex III, Point 10) | Annex VIII classification rules | Both classifications apply; meet stricter requirement |
| Conformity assessment (Art. 43) | Annex IX/X/XI assessment | MDR conformity assessment satisfies AI Act (Art. 120) |
| Technical documentation (Annex IV) | Annex II technical documentation | Extend MDR technical file with AI Act-specific elements |
| Risk management (Art. 9) | ISO 14971 + GSPR | ISO 14971 satisfies both when AI risks are included |
| Data governance (Art. 10) | GSPR 17 + Annex XIV | Add AI-specific data governance to clinical evaluation |
| Post-market monitoring (Art. 72) | Chapter VII PMS | Single PMS system covering both AI Act and MDR |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Device classification unclear -- rules yield different results | Multiple classification rules apply; highest class must be selected per MDR Article 51(7) | Apply all applicable rules from Annex VIII (Rules 1-22); use the implementing rule that gives the highest classification; for software, apply MDCG 2019-11 Rev.1 algorithm; document rationale for each rule considered |
| Notified Body rejects technical file for incompleteness | GSPR compliance matrix gaps, missing clinical evaluation, or insufficient risk management documentation | Review GSPR checklist in this skill; ensure Annex II technical file structure is complete; verify CER meets Annex XIV requirements; confirm ISO 14971 risk management file is current and comprehensive |
| EUDAMED registration delays blocking market access | Module not operational or manufacturer SRN not obtained | Check current EUDAMED module status; obtain SRN via actor registration module (operational); use national systems for vigilance reporting until Eudamed Vigilance module is fully functional |
| Clinical evidence insufficient for Class IIb/III device | Equivalence route rejected by NB or clinical investigation not planned | Reassess equivalence per MDCG 2020-1 Rev.1 (technical, biological, clinical equivalence with access to data); if equivalence fails, plan clinical investigation per Article 61; consider MDCG 2024-6 for reduced evidence burden on well-established devices |
| MDR transition deadline approaching with NB application pending | Limited NB capacity (approximately 40 designated EU-wide as of 2025) | Verify transition deadline for your device class (Class III: May 2026, Class IIb: Dec 2027, Class IIa: Dec 2028); ensure QMS application was submitted to NB by applicable deadline; maintain MDD/AIMDD compliance during transition |
| UDI labeling rejected by NB or competent authority | UDI-DI/UDI-PI format incorrect, AIDC carrier unreadable, or missing elements | Verify all required UDI elements per Article 27; ensure AIDC format (GS1 DataMatrix preferred) is scannable; include HRI adjacent to barcode; for reusable devices, apply direct marking that survives reprocessing |
| AI/ML medical device faces dual regulatory obligations | Device classified under both MDR and EU AI Act as high-risk | Assess both MDR Annex VIII classification and EU AI Act Annex III categorization; MDR conformity assessment may satisfy AI Act per Art. 120; extend technical documentation with AI-specific elements per MDCG 2024-8 |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Device correctly classified with documented rationale** -- classification per Annex VIII with all applicable rules evaluated, highest class selected, and rationale documented for NB review
- **Complete technical file per Annex II structure** -- device description, labeling/IFU, design and manufacturing info, GSPR compliance matrix, benefit-risk analysis, verification and validation, and clinical evaluation report all present and current
- **GSPR compliance matrix fully addressed** -- all applicable General Safety and Performance Requirements mapped to evidence with cross-references to risk management file, biocompatibility reports, sterilization validation, software documentation, and labeling
- **Clinical evaluation report meets Annex XIV requirements** -- literature search methodology documented, data appraised and analyzed, safety and performance conclusions stated, benefit-risk determined, and PMCF plan included
- **PMS system operational** -- PMS plan per Article 84, complaint handling procedures, vigilance reporting process, PSUR schedule defined by class, and PMCF activities integrated with CER
- **UDI system fully implemented** -- UDI-DI assigned per device variant, UDI-PI applied (lot/serial/dates), AIDC and HRI carriers on all packaging levels, EUDAMED registration complete (when applicable)
- **MDR gap analysis shows zero critical gaps** -- as measured by `mdr_gap_analyzer.py`, with all requirements addressed or in-progress with documented timeline

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- Device classification per MDR Annex VIII (Rules 1-22) including software classification per MDCG 2019-11 Rev.1
- Technical documentation structure and requirements per Annex II and Annex III
- GSPR compliance matrix with evidence mapping
- Clinical evidence strategy including equivalence assessment, CER structure, and PMCF planning
- Post-market surveillance system design including PMS plan, PSUR schedule, and vigilance reporting timelines
- EUDAMED and UDI system implementation guidance
- Conformity assessment route selection by device class
- MDR transition timeline tracking (post-Amendment Regulation 2023/607)
- AI/ML medical device considerations including EU AI Act interaction

**Out of Scope:**
- Clinical investigation protocol design, execution, or statistical analysis
- Biocompatibility testing per ISO 10993 (beyond evidence mapping in GSPR)
- Sterilization validation per ISO 11135/11137 (beyond evidence mapping)
- Notified Body selection, engagement, or commercial negotiation
- Quality Management System implementation -- use `quality-manager-qms-iso13485` for ISO 13485 QMS
- Risk management process implementation -- use `risk-management-specialist` for ISO 14971

**Important Notes:**
- EUDAMED's first four modules became mandatory from May 28, 2026; manufacturers must have SRN and device registrations ready
- Only approximately 40 Notified Bodies are designated EU-wide as of 2025, creating capacity constraints; early NB engagement is critical
- The European Commission published updated transition timelines in December 2025 extending deadlines for certain device categories
- Manufacturers must adopt recently harmonized standards with no formal transition period (Decision EU 2025/2078)
