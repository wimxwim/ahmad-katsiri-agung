# PM Interview Prep Expert

## Overview

PM interviews test five distinct skills, each with its own format, frameworks, and rubric: product sense, execution, strategy, behavioral, and technical. This skill organizes preparation across all five round types and calibrates expectations to the level you are interviewing for (APM, PM, Senior PM, Group PM). It bundles the most-used PM interview frameworks -- Lewis Lin's CIRCLES Method for product design, the AARM Method for improvement/metric questions, STAR for behavioral, and a 5-step estimation framework for market sizing -- plus question banks per round and structured answer templates calibrated by level.

## Core Capabilities

- **Five round types** -- product sense (design), product improvement, strategy, behavioral, technical/analytical, each with format and primary framework
- **Frameworks** -- CIRCLES, AARM, STAR (+ Reflection for senior), and 5-step estimation, with worked examples and failure modes
- **Level calibration** -- the same question scored differently for APM vs. PM vs. Senior PM vs. Group PM
- **Prep system** -- self-assessment, question banks, 8-12 behavioral story development, and structured mock-interview feedback

## When to Use

- **Preparing for PM interviews** -- You have a loop scheduled and need a structured plan to cover all rounds.
- **Mock interview prep** -- You are interviewing peers and want consistent rubrics.
- **Self-assessment** -- You want to identify your weakest interview category before investing prep time.
- **Switching levels** -- You are an IC PM moving to Senior or Senior moving to Group, and need to understand how the bar shifts.

**When NOT to use:** general career planning (use `pm-career-ladder/`); hiring as an interviewer (this is candidate-side); engineering or design interview prep (this is PM-specific).

## Quick Start

1. Rate yourself across the five round types (`assets/self_assessment.md`); pick your weakest two.
2. Pull level-targeted questions from `references/question-bank.md` and practice solo with the right framework, timed.
3. Run 2-3 mocks per round type using `assets/mock_feedback_form.md`.
4. Refine 8-12 behavioral stories (`assets/story_worksheet.md`) to under 5 minutes each, quantified.

See `references/round-frameworks-and-prep.md` for the full round reference, framework tables, level-calibration bars, prep workflow, and troubleshooting.

## Scope & Limitations

**In scope:** framework-based prep for all five PM round types; level calibration APM-Group PM; question banks and answer templates; behavioral story development and STAR refinement; self-assessment and mock-feedback tools.

**Out of scope:** Director/VP/CPO interviews (executive judgment, board influence, P&L — use leadership coaching); company-specific technical-PM screens (consult the role's rubric); salary negotiation/offer evaluation; resume and outreach prep (use `personal-productivity/resume/`).

**Caveats:** Frameworks are scaffolds, not scripts — interviewers down-rank verbatim recitation; internalize so the structure is invisible. Every company has its own rubric; adjust by the published guide and recruiter call. Mocking with a current PM at the target company beats any book.

## Integration Points

| Integration | Direction | What Flows |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| `pm-career-ladder/` | Bidirectional | Use the ladder rubric to understand the level you are interviewing for |
| `pm-onboarding/` | Feeds into | Once hired, the onboarding skill takes over for first 90 days |
| `personal-productivity/resume/` | Feeds from | A clean resume with quantified impact feeds the behavioral stories |
| `discovery/brainstorm-ideas/` | Reuses | Product sense rounds reuse the same ideation discipline as Product Trio sessions |
| `execution/prioritization-frameworks/` | Reuses | RICE, ICE, and Opportunity Score reasoning shows up in CIRCLES Step 4 (Cut through) |
