## Quick Start

### Workforce Planning Decision Tree

```
START: Business goal identified
  |
  v
[Can existing team deliver this goal?]
  |
  +-- YES --> [Is current capacity sustainable?]
  |             |
  |             +-- YES --> No hiring needed. Optimize.
  |             +-- NO  --> Hire for sustainability (backfill/support)
  |
  +-- NO  --> [Is this a skill gap or capacity gap?]
              |
              +-- SKILL GAP --> [Can we develop internally in < 90 days?]
              |                  |
              |                  +-- YES --> Train/develop. No hire.
              |                  +-- NO  --> Hire specialist.
              |
              +-- CAPACITY GAP --> [Is this temporary or permanent?]
                                    |
                                    +-- TEMPORARY --> Contract/agency
                                    +-- PERMANENT --> Full-time hire with business case
```

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Workforce Planning and Headcount

Every hire needs a business case. "We need more people" is not a business case.

#### Hiring Justification Framework

| Question | Required Answer |
|----------|----------------|
| What revenue or risk does this role address? | Specific dollar amount or risk description |
| What happens if we don't fill this in 90 days? | Concrete impact statement |
| Can existing team absorb this with re-prioritization? | Yes/No with explanation |
| What's the fully-loaded cost (salary + benefits + equity + tools + overhead)? | Dollar amount |
| What's the expected ramp time to full productivity? | Weeks/months |
| Who will manage this person? | Named manager with capacity |

#### Headcount Planning by Stage

| Stage | Team Size | CHRO Focus | Hiring Speed |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Pre-seed | 1-5 | Founders hire directly | 1-2/quarter |
| Seed | 5-15 | First structured interviews, no HR person yet | 2-4/quarter |
| Series A | 15-40 | First People hire, comp bands, career ladder v1 | 4-8/quarter |
| Series B | 40-100 | CHRO or VP People, full hiring process, HRIS | 8-20/quarter |
| Series C | 100-250 | People team (3-5), manager training, performance system | 15-40/quarter |
| Growth | 250+ | Full people function, analytics, L&D, total rewards | 30+/quarter |

### 2. Compensation Design

#### Compensation Band Architecture

```
Level Framework:
  IC Track                    Management Track
  ---------                   ----------------
  L1: Junior/Associate        --
  L2: Mid-level               --
  L3: Senior                  M1: Manager (first-time)
  L4: Staff/Principal         M2: Senior Manager
  L5: Distinguished/Fellow    M3: Director
  --                          M4: VP
  --                          M5: SVP/C-level
```

#### Band Construction Method

| Step | Action | Data Source |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Define levels with clear competency criteria | Internal role descriptions |
| 2 | Benchmark each level against market | Levels.fyi, Pave, Radford, Option Impact |
| 3 | Set band width (typically 20-30% spread) | Market data + internal equity |
| 4 | Position band midpoint at target percentile | P50 for cash, P50-P75 for total comp |
| 5 | Define equity bands per level | Stage-appropriate equity calculator |
| 6 | Set promotion criteria between levels | Performance + scope + impact |

#### Total Compensation Components

| Component | Purpose | Refresh Cadence |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Base salary | Market-rate cash compensation | Annual review |
| Annual bonus | Performance-linked variable pay | Annual (if applicable) |
| Equity (options/RSUs) | Long-term alignment and retention | Initial grant + annual refresh |
| Benefits | Health, 401k, perks | Annual review |
| Signing bonus | Competitive offer sweetener | One-time |

#### Equity Grant Guidelines by Stage

| Stage | IC Hire (L2-L3) | Senior Hire (L4-L5) | VP/C-Level |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Seed | 0.25-1.0% | 1.0-2.5% | 2.0-5.0% |
| Series A | 0.05-0.25% | 0.25-0.75% | 0.5-2.0% |
| Series B | 0.01-0.10% | 0.10-0.30% | 0.25-1.0% |
| Series C+ | 0.005-0.05% | 0.05-0.15% | 0.10-0.50% |

### 3. Organizational Design

#### Spans of Control Guidelines

| Role Type | Optimal Span | Warning Signs |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| IC Manager (engineering) | 5-8 direct reports | > 10: no coaching time. < 4: unnecessary layer |
| IC Manager (non-eng) | 6-10 direct reports | > 12: overwhelmed. < 5: manager inflation |
| Manager of Managers | 4-7 direct reports | > 8: can't support managers. < 3: too many layers |
| VP/Director | 5-8 direct reports | > 10: strategic thinking suffers |

#### When to Add Management Layers

```
TRIGGER: Team growing past threshold
  |
  v
[Current span of control > optimal?]
  |
  +-- NO  --> Don't add layer. Resist the urge.
  +-- YES --> [Is there a strong internal candidate?]
              |
              +-- YES --> Promote from within (faster, culture-preserving)
              +-- NO  --> [Is external hire justified?]
                          |
                          +-- YES --> Hire manager with 90-day expectations
                          +-- NO  --> Split team instead of adding layer
```

#### Org Design Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Title inflation | Everyone is a "Head of" at 20 people | Standardized level framework |
| Shadow org | Real decisions made outside official structure | Align authority with accountability |
| Matrix chaos | Every person has 3 reporting lines | One clear manager, dotted lines documented |
| Founder bottleneck | All decisions flow through founder | Delegation framework (see `founder-coach`) |
| Empire building | Managers hire to grow team, not to deliver | Tie headcount to business outcomes |

### 4. Performance Management

#### Calibrated Performance Framework

| Rating | Label | Distribution Target | Action |
|--------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| 5 | Exceptional | 5-10% | Accelerated promotion, significant equity refresh, retention bonus |
| 4 | Exceeds Expectations | 20-25% | Above-market raise, stretch assignment, mentor role |
| 3 | Meets Expectations | 50-60% | Market adjustment, development plan, new challenges |
| 2 | Needs Improvement | 10-15% | PIP with 60-day milestones, weekly manager check-ins |
| 1 | Underperforming | 2-5% | Exit conversation or immediate role change |

#### Performance Review Cadence

| Activity | Frequency | Owner | Participants |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 1:1 meetings | Weekly | Manager | Manager + direct report |
| Goal check-in | Monthly | Manager | Manager + direct report |
| Peer feedback collection | Quarterly | People team | Cross-functional peers |
| Performance review | Semi-annual | Manager + People | Manager, report, skip-level |
| Calibration session | Semi-annual | People team | All managers at same level |
| Promotion committee | Semi-annual | People + Leadership | Committee of L4+ leaders |

#### PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) Structure

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Specific gaps | Observable behaviors, not vague criticism |
| Measurable goals | 3-5 targets with success criteria |
| Timeline | 30-60 days maximum |
| Support offered | Training, mentoring, resources |
| Check-in cadence | Weekly minimum |
| Clear outcome | What happens if goals are met vs. not met |
| Documentation | Written, signed, filed |

### 5. Retention Strategy

#### Retention Risk Assessment Matrix

| Factor | Low Risk (1) | Medium Risk (2) | High Risk (3) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Comp competitiveness | Above P50 | At P50 | Below P50 |
| Manager relationship | Strong trust | Adequate | Friction or distrust |
| Career growth | Clear path, progressing | Path exists, slow progress | No visible path |
| Engagement | High eNPS, advocates | Neutral | Disengaged, passive |
| Tenure | < 1 year or > 3 years | 1-2 years | 18-24 months (cliff danger) |
| External demand | Low market demand | Moderate | Hot market, recruiters active |

**Total score 6-8**: Low risk. Monitor quarterly.
**Total score 9-13**: Medium risk. Proactive retention conversation needed.
**Total score 14-18**: High risk. Immediate intervention required.

#### Retention Intervention Ladder

```
Risk Level: LOW (6-8)
  --> Standard: competitive comp, regular 1:1s, career conversations

Risk Level: MEDIUM (9-13)
  --> Proactive: skip-level conversation, comp review, stretch project
  --> Timeline: act within 30 days of identification

Risk Level: HIGH (14-18)
  --> Urgent: retention package (comp + equity + role change), CEO involvement
  --> Timeline: act within 7 days of identification
  --> If departure: structured exit interview, knowledge transfer plan
```

## People Metrics Dashboard

### Tier 1: Board-Level Metrics (Monthly)

| Metric | Target | Red Flag | Data Source |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Regrettable attrition (annualized) | < 10% | > 15% | HRIS |
| eNPS score | > 30 | < 0 | Quarterly survey |
| Time to fill (critical roles) | < 45 days | > 90 days | ATS |
| Offer acceptance rate | > 85% | < 70% | ATS |
| Revenue per employee | Growing QoQ | Declining | Finance + HRIS |

### Tier 2: Leadership Metrics (Weekly)

| Metric | Target | Action Trigger |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Open requisitions | Per plan | > 120% of plan = capacity strain |
| 90-day voluntary turnover | < 5% | > 8% = onboarding/hiring problem |
| Manager effectiveness score | > 3.8/5 | < 3.5 = management development needed |
| % employees within comp band | > 90% | < 80% = band recalibration needed |
| Internal promotion rate | > 25% | < 15% = career development gap |

### Tier 3: Operational Metrics (Daily/Weekly)

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Pipeline by role (candidates per stage) | Hiring velocity tracking |
| Interviewer load (interviews per person per week) | Prevent interviewer burnout |
| Offer-to-close time | Process efficiency |
| Compa-ratio distribution | Compensation equity |
| Training completion rate | Compliance and development |

---

## Red Flags

- Attrition spikes with exit interviews naming the same manager -- manager problem, not culture problem
- Comp bands not refreshed in 18+ months -- losing candidates and retaining the wrong people
- No career ladder exists -- top performers leave at 18-24 months
- Hiring without written job scorecard -- inconsistent decisions, bias risk
- Performance reviews happen once a year only -- problems fester
- Equity refreshes limited to executives -- key ICs become flight risks
- Time to fill > 90 days for critical roles -- process is broken or comp is wrong
- eNPS below 0 -- structural problem, not a morale issue
- More than 3 org layers between IC and CEO at < 50 people -- over-managed
- HR team ratio > 1:100 (too lean) or < 1:40 (too heavy) -- right-size the function
- No structured onboarding beyond day 1 -- 90-day attrition will spike

## Integration with C-Suite

| When... | CHRO Works With... | To... |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Headcount planning | CFO (`cfo-advisor`) | Model fully-loaded cost, secure budget |
| Hiring timing | COO (`coo-advisor`) | Align with operational capacity and project timelines |
| Engineering hiring | CTO (`cto-advisor`) | Define technical scorecards, level expectations |
| Revenue team scaling | CRO (`cro-advisor`) | Quota coverage modeling, ramp time projections |

---

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these without being asked when detected:

- Key person approaching equity cliff with no refresh plan -- retention risk, act immediately
- Hiring plan exists but no comp bands defined -- will overpay or lose candidates
- Team growing past 25-30 with no manager layer -- org strain imminent
- No performance review cycle -- underperformers hide, top performers leave
- Regrettable attrition > 10% -- mandatory exit interview analysis
- Manager-to-IC ratio outside 1:5-1:10 range -- org structure review needed
- No succession plan for any leadership role -- single-point-of-failure risk
- Offer acceptance rate drops below 75% -- comp or process problem

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Attrition spikes with exit interviews naming the same manager | Manager problem, not culture problem | Investigate the specific manager; provide coaching or make a change |
| Comp bands not refreshed in 18+ months | Market has moved; losing candidates and retaining wrong people | Benchmark against Levels.fyi/Pave/Radford; update bands quarterly for hot roles |
| Top performers leave at 18-24 months | No career ladder; equity cliff approaching with no refresh | Build career ladder with clear criteria; implement annual equity refresh program |
| Offer acceptance rate drops below 75% | Comp is wrong, process is too slow, or candidate experience is poor | Audit rejected offers for reason; benchmark comp; measure time-to-offer |
| Performance reviews happen once a year and problems fester | Review cadence too infrequent; no continuous feedback culture | Implement weekly 1:1s, monthly goal check-ins, semi-annual formal reviews |
| eNPS drops below 0 | Structural problem, not a morale event | Deep-dive survey results by department and manager; address root causes |

---

## Success Criteria

- Regrettable attrition below 10% annualized (measured monthly, reported to board quarterly)
- eNPS score above 30 (surveyed quarterly with 80%+ participation)
- Time to fill for critical roles under 45 days (measured from req open to offer accepted)
- Offer acceptance rate above 85% (tracked in ATS, reviewed monthly)
- 90%+ of employees within their compensation band (measured quarterly via comp_band_analyzer.py)
- Internal promotion rate above 25% (promotions / total role fills)
- Zero key-person departures without a succession plan activated (retention_risk_scorer.py identifies risk)

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope**: Workforce planning, compensation design, org structure, performance management, retention strategy, career ladders, people analytics, headcount modeling, comp band analysis.

**Out of Scope**: Employment law advice, immigration processing, payroll operations, benefits administration, workers' compensation claims, union negotiations, individual employee counseling.

**Limitations**: Retention risk scoring relies on manager assessments which may have bias. Comp band analysis uses provided market data -- accuracy depends on benchmark quality. Headcount planner uses linear cost projections that don't account for signing bonuses, relocation, or variable compensation. Pay equity analysis requires gender/demographic data which may not be available.
