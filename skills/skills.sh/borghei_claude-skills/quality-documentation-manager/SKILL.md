## Clarify First

Before setting up document control or validating a document, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Document type** — QM, SOP, WI, TF, SPEC, or PLN (sets the required reviewers, approvers, and numbering)
- [ ] **Regulatory scope** — ISO 13485 only vs 21 CFR Part 11 electronic records (determines whether audit-trail and e-signature controls are required)
- [ ] **Change classification** — administrative, minor, major, or emergency (sets the approval path and impact assessment)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the document.

## Document Control Workflow

Implement document control from creation through obsolescence:

1. Assign document number per numbering procedure
2. Create document using controlled template
3. Route for review to required reviewers
4. Address review comments and document responses
5. Obtain required approval signatures
6. Assign effective date and distribute
7. Update Document Master List
8. **Validation:** Document accessible at point of use; obsolete versions removed

### Document Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Definition | Actions Required |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| Draft | Under creation or revision | Author editing, not for use |
| Review | Circulated for review | Reviewers provide feedback |
| Approved | All signatures obtained | Ready for training/distribution |
| Effective | Training complete, released | Available for use |
| Superseded | Replaced by newer revision | Remove from active use |
| Obsolete | No longer applicable | Archive per retention schedule |

### Document Types and Prefixes

| Prefix | Document Type | Typical Content |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| QM | Quality Manual | QMS overview, scope, policy |
| SOP | Standard Operating Procedure | Process-level procedures |
| WI | Work Instruction | Task-level step-by-step |
| TF | Template/Form | Controlled forms |
| SPEC | Specification | Product/process specs |
| PLN | Plan | Quality/project plans |

### Required Reviewers by Document Type

| Document Type | Required Reviewers | Required Approvers |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| SOP | Process Owner, QA | QA Manager, Process Owner |
| WI | Area Supervisor, QA | Area Manager |
| SPEC | Engineering, QA | Engineering Manager, QA |
| TF | Process Owner | QA |
| Design Documents | Design Team, QA | Design Control Authority |

---

## Document Numbering System

Assign consistent document numbers for identification and retrieval.

### Numbering Format

Standard format: `PREFIX-CATEGORY-SEQUENCE[-REVISION]`

```
Example: SOP-02-001-A

SOP = Document type (Standard Operating Procedure)
02  = Category code (Document Control)
001 = Sequential number
A   = Revision indicator
```

### Category Codes

| Code | Functional Area | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| 01 | Quality Management | QMS procedures, management review |
| 02 | Document Control | This area |
| 03 | Human Resources | Training, competency |
| 04 | Design & Development | Design control processes |
| 05 | Purchasing | Supplier management |
| 06 | Production | Manufacturing procedures |
| 07 | Quality Control | Inspection, testing |
| 08 | CAPA | Corrective/preventive actions |
| 09 | Risk Management | ISO 14971 processes |
| 10 | Regulatory Affairs | Submissions, compliance |

### Numbering Workflow

1. Author requests document number from Document Control
2. Document Control verifies category assignment
3. Document Control assigns next available sequence number
4. Number recorded in Document Master List
5. Author creates document using assigned number
6. **Validation:** Number format matches standard; no duplicates in Master List

### Revision Designation

| Change Type | Revision Increment | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Major revision | Increment number | Rev 01 → Rev 02 |
| Minor revision | Increment sub-revision | Rev 01 → Rev 01.1 |
| Administrative | No change or letter suffix | Rev 01 → Rev 01a |

See `references/document-control-procedures.md` for complete numbering guidance.

---

## Approval and Review Process

Obtain required reviews and approvals before document release.

### Review Workflow

1. Author completes document draft
2. Author submits for review via routing form or DMS
3. Reviewers assigned based on document type
4. Reviewers provide comments within review period (5-10 business days)
5. Author addresses comments and documents responses
6. Author resubmits revised document
7. Approvers sign and date
8. **Validation:** All required reviewers completed; all comments addressed with documented disposition

### Comment Disposition

| Disposition | Action Required |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Accept | Incorporate comment as written |
| Accept with modification | Incorporate with changes, document rationale |
| Reject | Do not incorporate, document justification |
| Defer | Address in future revision, document reason |

### Approval Matrix

```
Document Level 1 (Policy/QM): CEO or delegate + QA Manager
Document Level 2 (SOP): Department Manager + QA Manager
Document Level 3 (WI/TF): Area Supervisor + QA Representative
```

### Signature Requirements

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Name | Printed name of signer |
| Signature | Handwritten or electronic signature |
| Date | Date signature applied |
| Role | Function/role of signer |

---

## Change Control Process

Manage document changes systematically through review and approval.

### Change Control Workflow

1. Identify need for document change
2. Complete Change Request Form with justification
3. Document Control assigns change number and logs request
4. Route to reviewers for impact assessment
5. Obtain approvals based on change classification
6. Author implements approved changes
7. Update revision number and change history
8. **Validation:** Changes match approved scope; change history complete

### Change Classification

| Class | Definition | Approval Level | Examples |
|-------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Administrative | No content impact | Document Control | Typos, formatting |
| Minor | Limited content change | Process Owner + QA | Clarifications |
| Major | Significant content change | Full review cycle | New requirements |
| Emergency | Urgent safety/compliance | Expedited + retrospective | Safety issues |

### Impact Assessment Checklist

| Impact Area | Assessment Questions |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Training | Does change require retraining? |
| Equipment | Does change affect equipment or systems? |
| Validation | Does change require revalidation? |
| Regulatory | Does change affect regulatory filings? |
| Other Documents | Which related documents need updating? |
| Records | What records are affected? |

### Change History Documentation

Each document must include change history:

```
| Revision | Date | Description | Author | Approver |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 01 | 2023-01-15 | Initial release | J. Smith | M. Jones |
| 02 | 2024-03-01 | Updated workflow | J. Smith | M. Jones |
```

## 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance

Implement electronic record and signature controls for FDA compliance.

### Part 11 Scope

| Applies To | Does Not Apply To |
|------------|-------------------|
| Records required by FDA regulations | Paper records |
| Records submitted to FDA | Internal non-regulated documents |
| Electronic signatures on required records | General email communication |

### Electronic Record Controls

1. Validate system for accuracy and reliability
2. Implement secure audit trail for all changes
3. Restrict system access to authorized individuals
4. Generate accurate copies in human-readable format
5. Protect records throughout retention period
6. **Validation:** Audit trail captures who, what, when for all changes

### Audit Trail Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Secure | Cannot be modified by users |
| Computer-generated | System creates automatically |
| Time-stamped | Date and time of each action |
| Original values | Previous values retained |
| User identity | Who made each change |

### Electronic Signature Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Unique to individual | Not shared between persons |
| At least 2 components | User ID + password minimum |
| Signature manifestation | Name, date/time, meaning displayed |
| Linked to record | Cannot be excised or copied |

### Signature Manifestation

Every electronic signature must display:

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Printed name | John Smith |
| Date and time | 2024-03-15 14:32:05 EST |
| Meaning | Approved for Release |

### System Controls Checklist

**Access Controls:**
- [ ] Unique user ID for each person
- [ ] Password complexity enforced
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Session timeout after inactivity

**Audit Trail:**
- [ ] All record creation logged

## Document Control Metrics

Track document control system performance.

### Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Target | Calculation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Document cycle time | <30 days | Average days from draft to effective |
| Review completion rate | >95% | Reviews completed on time / Total reviews |
| Change request backlog | <10 | Open change requests at month end |
| Overdue review rate | <5% | Documents past review date / Total effective |
| Audit finding rate | <2 per audit | Document control findings per internal audit |

### Periodic Review Schedule

| Document Type | Review Frequency |
|---------------|------------------|
| Policy | Every 3 years |
| SOP | Every 2 years |
| WI | Every 2 years |
| Specifications | As needed or with product changes |
| Forms/Templates | Every 3 years |

---

## Regulatory Requirements

### ISO 13485:2016 Clause 4.2

| Sub-clause | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| 4.2.1 | Quality management system documentation |
| 4.2.2 | Quality manual |
| 4.2.3 | Medical device file (technical documentation) |
| 4.2.4 | Control of documents |
| 4.2.5 | Control of records |

### FDA 21 CFR 820

| Section | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| 820.40 | Document controls |
| 820.180 | General record requirements |
| 820.181 | Device master record |
| 820.184 | Device history record |
| 820.186 | Quality system record |

### Common Audit Findings

| Finding | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Obsolete documents in use | Implement distribution control |
| Missing approval signatures | Enforce workflow before release |
| Incomplete change history | Require history update with each revision |
| No periodic review schedule | Establish and enforce review calendar |
| Inadequate audit trail | Validate DMS for Part 11 compliance |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Document validator reports "invalid numbering format" | Document number does not match the `PREFIX-CATEGORY-SEQUENCE` pattern | Ensure the number follows the format `SOP-02-001` (type prefix, 2-digit category code, 3-digit sequence). Check that the prefix matches a recognized document type (QM, SOP, WI, TF, SPEC, PLN). |
| Validation flags missing approver despite having signatures | `approver` field is null or empty in the input JSON | Populate the `approver` field with the name of the approving authority. For SOPs, both Process Owner and QA Manager are required. |
| Review date validation fails for a current document | `review_date` is in the past | Update the review date to reflect the next scheduled review. Documents past their review date should be flagged for periodic review and re-approval. |
| Change history marked incomplete | Not all revisions have entries in the `change_history` array | Every revision increment must have a corresponding change history entry with revision number, date, description, and author. Fill gaps in the history. |
| Part 11 controls flagged despite using an eDMS | `has_audit_trail` or `has_electronic_signature` set to false | Set both to `true` and ensure `signature_components` is at least 2 (user ID + password minimum per Part 11). Verify the eDMS produces computer-generated, timestamped audit trails. |
| Interactive mode does not display all validation rules | Terminal width too narrow for table output | Widen the terminal window or use `--output json` for structured output that is not affected by display width. |
| Obsolete documents still appearing as "Effective" | Status field not updated during revision cycle | When a new revision is released, update the prior revision's status to "Superseded" and ensure it is removed from points of use. Run the validator against the superseded document to confirm. |

---

## Success Criteria

- Document numbering system enforced with zero duplicate numbers in the Document Master List and 100% format compliance
- Document cycle time (draft to effective) averages less than 30 business days across all document types
- Review completion rate exceeds 95% (reviews completed on time vs. total reviews initiated)
- Overdue periodic review rate below 5% of total effective documents at any point
- 21 CFR Part 11 compliance verified for all electronic records: audit trails capture who/what/when for every change, electronic signatures include printed name, date/time, and meaning
- Change control process handles 100% of document changes through the classification workflow (Administrative/Minor/Major/Emergency) with documented impact assessments
- Zero external audit findings related to document control in the most recent certification or surveillance audit

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- Document numbering convention design and validation
- Document lifecycle management (Draft through Obsolete)
- Review and approval workflow enforcement
- Change control process with classification and impact assessment
- 21 CFR Part 11 electronic record and electronic signature compliance validation
- Periodic review schedule management
- Document Master List maintenance

**Out of Scope:**
- eDMS software selection, implementation, or validation (the tool validates metadata, not the DMS platform itself)
- EU Annex 11 computerized system validation (complementary to Part 11 but requires separate assessment approach)
- Technical file / Design History File content creation (use regulatory-affairs-head for technical documentation)
- Record retention schedule creation (the tool validates dates but does not determine regulatory retention periods)
- Physical document distribution or archival logistics
- Training record management (the tool validates training-related documents but does not manage training programs)

---

## Integration Points

| Skill | Integration |
|-------|------------|
| [quality-manager-qms-iso13485](../quality-manager-qms-iso13485/) | Document control (Clause 4.2.3) and record control (Clause 4.2.4) are core QMS processes; the validator enforces ISO 13485 documentation requirements |
| [qms-audit-expert](../qms-audit-expert/) | Internal audits of Clause 4.2 verify document control effectiveness; audit findings drive document process improvements |
| [quality-manager-qmr](../quality-manager-qmr/) | Document control metrics (cycle time, overdue reviews, backlog) are reported to management review as QMS performance indicators |
| [fda-consultant-specialist](../fda-consultant-specialist/) | FDA QMSR (effective Feb 2026) incorporates ISO 13485 Clause 4.2 by reference; Part 11 compliance remains a separate FDA requirement for electronic records |
| [capa-officer](../capa-officer/) | CAPA actions frequently require document revisions; the change control process tracks CAPA-driven document changes |
