## Clarify First

Before generating stories or a sprint plan, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Persona who benefits** — the specific user the story serves (drives the "As a..." clause and acceptance criteria)
- [ ] **The requirement or epic scope** — the capability and its success condition (drives story breakdown and INVEST validation)
- [ ] **Team velocity and availability** — rolling average points and PTO/holidays this sprint (sets committed vs stretch capacity)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## User Story Generation Workflow

Create INVEST-compliant user stories from requirements:

1. Identify the persona (who benefits from this feature)
2. Define the action or capability needed
3. Articulate the benefit or value delivered
4. Write acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then
5. Estimate story points using Fibonacci scale
6. Validate against INVEST criteria
7. Add to backlog with priority
8. **Validation:** Story passes all INVEST criteria; acceptance criteria are testable

### User Story Template

```
As a [persona],
I want to [action/capability],
So that [benefit/value].
```

**Example:**
```
As a marketing manager,
I want to export campaign reports to PDF,
So that I can share results with stakeholders who don't have system access.
```

### Story Types

| Type | Template | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Feature | As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit] | As a user, I want to filter search results so that I find items faster |
| Improvement | As a [persona], I need [capability] to [goal] | As a user, I need faster page loads to complete tasks without frustration |
| Bug Fix | As a [persona], I expect [behavior] when [condition] | As a user, I expect my cart to persist when I refresh the page |
| Enabler | As a developer, I need to [technical task] to enable [capability] | As a developer, I need to implement caching to enable instant search |

### Persona Reference

| Persona | Typical Needs | Context |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| End User | Efficiency, simplicity, reliability | Daily feature usage |
| Administrator | Control, visibility, security | System management |
| Power User | Automation, customization, shortcuts | Expert workflows |
| New User | Guidance, learning, safety | Onboarding |

---

## Acceptance Criteria Patterns

Write testable acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format.

### Given-When-Then Template

```
Given [precondition/context],
When [action/trigger],
Then [expected outcome].
```

**Examples:**
```
Given the user is logged in with valid credentials,
When they click the "Export" button,
Then a PDF download starts within 2 seconds.

Given the user has entered an invalid email format,
When they submit the registration form,
Then an inline error message displays "Please enter a valid email address."

Given the shopping cart contains items,
When the user refreshes the browser,
Then the cart contents remain unchanged.
```

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist

Each story should include criteria for:

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Happy Path | Given valid input, When submitted, Then success message displayed |
| Validation | Should reject input when required field is empty |
| Error Handling | Must show user-friendly message when API fails |
| Performance | Should complete operation within 2 seconds |
| Accessibility | Must be navigable via keyboard only |

### Minimum Criteria by Story Size

| Story Points | Minimum AC Count |
|--------------|------------------|
| 1-2 | 3-4 criteria |
| 3-5 | 4-6 criteria |
| 8 | 5-8 criteria |
| 13+ | Split the story |

See `references/user-story-templates.md` for complete template library.

---

## Epic Breakdown Workflow

Break epics into deliverable sprint-sized stories:

1. Define epic scope and success criteria
2. Identify all personas affected by the epic
3. List all capabilities needed for each persona
4. Group capabilities into logical stories
5. Validate each story is ≤8 points
6. Identify dependencies between stories
7. Sequence stories for incremental delivery
8. **Validation:** Each story delivers standalone value; total stories cover epic scope

### Story Splitting Decision Logic

Apply these rules in order. Use the first rule that fits the story:

| # | Split Rule | When It Applies | How to Split |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Workflow Steps** | Story contains multiple sequential steps | Each step becomes its own story |
| 2 | **Business Rule Variations** | Story introduces rule variations (e.g., pricing tiers, user roles) | Each rule variation becomes its own story |
| 3 | **Data Variations** | Story handles different data types or formats | Each data type becomes its own story |
| 4 | **Complex Acceptance Criteria** | Story has 8+ acceptance criteria covering distinct behaviors | Each distinct behavior cluster becomes its own story |
| 5 | **Major Effort** | Story requires significant build effort (13+ points) | Split along effort milestones (foundation → feature → polish) |
| 6 | **External Dependencies** | Story depends on external APIs, teams, or approvals | Split dependent and independent work into separate stories |
| 7 | **DevOps Effort** | Story requires significant infrastructure work | Split infrastructure setup from feature implementation |
| 8 | **None Apply** | Story is already small but unclear | Use Tiny Acts of Discovery (TADs) -- small spikes to reduce uncertainty |

### Split Output Format

For each split, document:

```markdown
## Original Story
As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit].
Points: 13 | Status: Too large for sprint

## Suggested Splits

### Split 1: By Workflow Steps
- **Story A:** As a [persona], I want to [step 1] so that [partial benefit].
  Points: 5 | Independently valuable: Yes
- **Story B:** As a [persona], I want to [step 2] so that [remaining benefit].
  Points: 5 | Independently valuable: Yes

### Risks & Tradeoffs
- [What coupling exists between the split stories]
- [What is lost by delivering them separately]

### Implementation Order
1. Story A (foundation) → 2. Story B (builds on A)
```

### Splitting Techniques (Quick Reference)

| Technique | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| By workflow step | Linear process | "Checkout" → "Add to cart" + "Enter payment" + "Confirm order" |
| By persona | Multiple user types | "Dashboard" → "Admin dashboard" + "User dashboard" |
| By data type | Multiple inputs | "Import" → "Import CSV" + "Import Excel" |
| By operation | CRUD functionality | "Manage users" → "Create" + "Edit" + "Delete" |
| By business rule | Rule variations | "Discount" → "% discount" + "Fixed discount" + "BOGO" |
| Happy path first | Risk reduction | "Feature" → "Basic flow" + "Error handling" + "Edge cases" |
| By dependency | External blockers | "Integration" → "Mock integration" + "Live integration" |
| Tiny Acts of Discovery | High uncertainty | "AI feature" → "Spike: feasibility" + "MVP implementation" |

### Epic Example

**Epic:** User Dashboard

**Breakdown:**
```
Epic: User Dashboard (34 points total)
├── US-001: View key metrics (5 pts) - End User
├── US-002: Customize layout (5 pts) - Power User
├── US-003: Export data to CSV (3 pts) - End User
├── US-004: Share with team (5 pts) - End User
├── US-005: Set up alerts (5 pts) - Power User
├── US-006: Filter by date range (3 pts) - End User
├── US-007: Admin overview (5 pts) - Admin
└── US-008: Enable caching (3 pts) - Enabler
```

## Sprint Planning Workflow

Plan sprint capacity and select stories:

1. Calculate team capacity (velocity × availability)
2. Review sprint goal with stakeholders
3. Select stories from prioritized backlog
4. Fill to 80-85% of capacity (committed)
5. Add stretch goals (10-15% additional)
6. Identify dependencies and risks
7. Break complex stories into tasks
8. **Validation:** Committed points ≤85% capacity; all stories have acceptance criteria

### Capacity Calculation

```
Sprint Capacity = Average Velocity × Availability Factor

Example:
Average Velocity: 30 points
Team availability: 90% (one member partially out)
Adjusted Capacity: 27 points

Committed: 23 points (85% of 27)
Stretch: 4 points (15% of 27)
```

### Availability Factors

| Scenario | Factor |
|----------|--------|
| Full sprint, no PTO | 1.0 |
| One team member out 50% | 0.9 |
| Holiday during sprint | 0.8 |
| Multiple members out | 0.7 |

### Sprint Loading Template

```
Sprint Capacity: 27 points
Sprint Goal: [Clear, measurable objective]

COMMITTED (23 points):
[H] US-001: User dashboard (5 pts)
[H] US-002: Export feature (3 pts)
[H] US-003: Search filter (5 pts)
[M] US-004: Settings page (5 pts)
[M] US-005: Help tooltips (3 pts)
[L] US-006: Theme options (2 pts)

STRETCH (4 points):
[L] US-007: Sort options (2 pts)
[L] US-008: Print view (2 pts)
```

See `references/sprint-planning-guide.md` for complete planning procedures.

## Backlog Prioritization

Prioritize backlog using value and effort assessment.

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Definition | Sprint Target |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Critical | Blocking users, security, data loss | Immediate |
| High | Core functionality, key user needs | This sprint |
| Medium | Improvements, enhancements | Next 2-3 sprints |
| Low | Nice-to-have, minor improvements | Backlog |

### Prioritization Factors

| Factor | Weight | Questions |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Business Value | 40% | Revenue impact? User demand? Strategic alignment? |
| User Impact | 30% | How many users? How frequently used? |
| Risk/Dependencies | 15% | Technical risk? External dependencies? |
| Effort | 15% | Size? Complexity? Uncertainty? |

### INVEST Criteria Validation

Before adding to sprint, validate each story:

| Criterion | Question | Pass If... |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **I**ndependent | Can this be developed without other uncommitted stories? | No blocking dependencies |
| **N**egotiable | Is the implementation flexible? | Multiple approaches possible |
| **V**aluable | Does this deliver user or business value? | Clear benefit in "so that" |
| **E**stimable | Can the team estimate this? | Understood well enough to size |
| **S**mall | Can this complete in one sprint? | ≤8 story points |
| **T**estable | Can we verify this is done? | Clear acceptance criteria |

## Tool Reference

### user_story_generator.py

Generates INVEST-compliant user stories from a sample epic, including acceptance criteria, story point estimates, priority assignments, and sprint planning.

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `sprint` | subcommand | - | Run in sprint planning mode |
| `[capacity]` | int | 30 | Sprint capacity in story points (used with `sprint`) |

```bash
# Generate stories from sample epic
python scripts/user_story_generator.py

# Sprint planning with capacity
python scripts/user_story_generator.py sprint 30
python scripts/user_story_generator.py sprint 45
```

**Output includes:**
- Story ID, title, type, priority, and point estimate
- User story narrative in "As a... I want... So that..." format
- 5 acceptance criteria per story (Given-When-Then, validation, error, performance, accessibility)
- INVEST criteria checklist per story
- Backlog summary with priority breakdown
- Sprint loading with committed and stretch items (in sprint mode)

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Stories too large (>8 points) | Epic not broken down enough | Apply splitting techniques: by workflow step, persona, or CRUD operation |
| Acceptance criteria untestable | Criteria use vague language | Rewrite using Given-When-Then format with specific, observable outcomes |
| Sprint commitment missed repeatedly | Velocity not stabilized or too aggressive | Track velocity over 3+ sprints; commit to 80-85% of rolling average |
| Too many carryover stories | Mid-sprint scope changes or poor estimation | Enforce no-scope-change rule; calibrate estimates using planning poker |
| Stories lack clear value | Missing "so that" benefit clause | Validate every story answers: who benefits, what they get, and why it matters |
| Sprint has too many dependencies | Stories not independent | Re-sequence backlog; break dependent stories into independent slices |
| Stakeholders dispute priority | No objective prioritization framework | Use WSJF or value/effort scoring; document decision rationale |

---

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | How to Measure |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Commitment reliability | >85% of committed points completed | Points completed / Points committed per sprint |
| INVEST compliance | 100% of stories pass all 6 criteria | user_story_generator INVEST checklist |
| Velocity stability | Within +/-10% of rolling average | Track velocity trend over 5+ sprints |
| Scope change | <10% of sprint points added/removed mid-sprint | Count points added or removed after planning |
| Carryover rate | <15% of committed points | Points not completed / Points committed |
| Acceptance criteria quality | All criteria testable and verified | QA sign-off on acceptance criteria before sprint start |
| Backlog grooming | Top 2 sprints of backlog always ready | Count of refined stories with acceptance criteria |

---
