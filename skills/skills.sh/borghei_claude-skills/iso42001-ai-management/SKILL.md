## Reference Guides

### ISO 42001 Clause Guide
`references/iso42001-clause-guide.md`

Comprehensive clause-by-clause guidance:
- All clauses (4-10) with requirements and implementation steps
- Annex A controls (A.2-A.10) detailed with evidence requirements
- Audit questions per clause for internal audit preparation
- Common nonconformity findings and how to avoid them
- Required documented information per clause
- Cross-references to ISO 27001, ISO 9001, and EU AI Act

### AI Lifecycle Management
`references/ai-lifecycle-management.md`

End-to-end AI system lifecycle guidance:
- Lifecycle stages: design, development, testing, deployment, monitoring, retirement
- Design and development controls (requirements, architecture, coding standards)
- Testing and validation requirements (functional, bias, robustness, performance)
- Deployment procedures (staging, canary, rollback, approval gates)
- Monitoring and maintenance (drift detection, performance degradation, retraining)
- Retirement and decommissioning (data disposal, model archival, stakeholder notification)
- Data management across lifecycle (quality, provenance, bias assessment, lineage)
- Model versioning and change management (version control, change impact, approval workflows)

---

## Clarify First

Before running the assessment, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **AIMS scope** — which AI systems and organizational boundaries are in scope (drives the readiness assessment and per-system impact assessments)
- [ ] **Task** — AIMS readiness assessment vs per-system AI impact assessment (selects the tool and workflow)
- [ ] **Certification target** — initial certification, surveillance, or internal-only (sets the score threshold and evidence depth)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the assessment.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Readiness score low on Clause 5 (Leadership) despite executive sponsorship | AI policy does not include ethical principles, responsible AI commitment, or framework for setting AI objectives | Update AI policy to explicitly address all required elements: ethical principles, responsible AI, legal alignment, continual improvement commitment, and AI objectives framework; obtain formal management sign-off |
| AI impact assessment returns High/Critical risk across all dimensions | AI system processes sensitive personal data, makes autonomous decisions, and affects large populations without safeguards | Implement targeted mitigations per dimension: human-in-the-loop for safety, bias testing for fairness, explainability mechanisms for transparency, data protection for privacy; re-run assessment after mitigation |
| Annex A controls scored as "Not Implemented" despite operational practices | Practices exist informally but are not documented per ISO 42001 requirements | Document all existing AI practices as formal procedures; create evidence artifacts (policy documents, meeting minutes, risk registers, training records); map to specific Annex A control objectives |
| Certification body auditor questions AI risk assessment methodology | Risk assessment does not cover all seven required risk categories (fairness, transparency, safety, privacy, security, accountability, societal) | Update risk assessment methodology to explicitly address all ISO 42001 risk categories; use `ai_impact_assessor.py` template to ensure comprehensive coverage; document risk criteria and tolerance levels |
| Third-party AI components lack governance controls | Organization uses third-party AI models or APIs without formal evaluation or supplier management | Implement Annex A.10 (Third-Party Relationships) controls; evaluate all third-party AI components; establish contractual requirements for AI service providers; monitor supplier AI practices |
| Data management procedures incomplete for AI lifecycle | Data quality, provenance, and bias assessment not systematically performed for training and evaluation data | Implement Annex A.7 (Data for AI Systems) controls; establish data quality assessment procedures; document data provenance and lineage; conduct bias assessments per dataset; define retention and disposal procedures |
| Stage 1 audit finds AIMS documentation insufficient | Documentation follows generic QMS structure without AI-specific elements | Restructure documentation to address all ISO 42001 clauses (4-10) and Annex A controls (A.2-A.10); include AI-specific policies, risk assessments, impact assessments, and lifecycle procedures |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Overall readiness score of 80+ for certification readiness** -- as measured by `aims_readiness_checker.py`, with all clauses at Defined maturity level or above
- **AI policy established and communicated** -- including ethical principles, responsible AI commitment, legal compliance alignment, continual improvement, and framework for AI objectives, with formal management approval
- **AI impact assessments completed for all in-scope AI systems** -- covering all six dimensions (fairness, transparency, safety, privacy, security, accountability) with risk treatments documented and residual risk accepted by management
- **AI risk assessment methodology covers all required categories** -- fairness, transparency, safety, privacy, security, accountability, and societal/environmental impacts, with defined risk criteria and tolerance levels
- **Annex A controls implemented with evidence** -- A.2 (Policies) through A.10 (Third-Party) with documented procedures, records, and evidence artifacts suitable for certification audit
- **Internal audit conducted against all AIMS clauses** -- with findings documented, corrective actions tracked to closure, and management review completed with documented improvement decisions
- **AI lifecycle procedures operational** -- covering design, development, testing, deployment, monitoring, and retirement stages with documented controls at each gate

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- ISO 42001:2023 readiness assessment across all clauses (4-10) and Annex A controls (A.2-A.10)
- AI impact assessment across six dimensions (fairness, transparency, safety, privacy, security, accountability)
- AIMS certification preparation including gap analysis, implementation roadmap, and audit readiness
- AI lifecycle management guidance (design through retirement)
- Data management for AI systems (quality, provenance, bias, governance)
- Third-party AI supplier management and evaluation
- Regulatory mapping to EU AI Act requirements
- Integration guidance with ISO 27001, ISO 9001, and ISO 14001

**Out of Scope:**
- Actual AI model development, training, testing, or deployment -- this skill provides governance frameworks, not ML engineering
- Certification body selection, audit scheduling, or certification fee negotiation
- Ethical review board establishment or ethical decision-making beyond procedural guidance
- Specific AI fairness algorithm implementation (e.g., adversarial debiasing, calibrated equalized odds) -- use `eu-ai-act-specialist` bias detector for technical testing
- Environmental impact measurement or carbon footprint calculation for AI training

**Important Notes:**
- ISO 42001 certification follows a 3-year cycle with annual surveillance audits at 12-month intervals
- Major certification bodies (BSI, DNV, TUV, LRQA) have operationalized ISO 42001 audit services as of 2025-2026
- Many organizations pursue dual alignment: ISO 42001 certification for governance controls plus EU AI Code of Practice for regulatory expectations
- The standard's Annex SL structure enables direct integration with ISO 27001, reducing redundant documentation and audit effort

---

## Integration Points

| Skill | Integration | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `eu-ai-act-specialist` | ISO 42001 AIMS maps directly to EU AI Act requirements; certification demonstrates Art. 17 QMS compliance | When building AI governance satisfying both ISO 42001 and EU AI Act obligations |
| `information-security-manager-iso27001` | ISO 27001 security controls integrate with AIMS via shared Annex SL structure; risk assessment methodologies align | When implementing joint ISMS + AIMS covering both information security and AI governance |
| `gdpr-dsgvo-expert` | AIMS data management (Annex A.7) aligns with GDPR data protection requirements; AI processing requires DPIA | When AI systems process personal data and require both AIMS and GDPR compliance |
| `isms-audit-expert` | Internal audit methodology and finding management shared between ISO 27001 and ISO 42001 | When conducting internal audits covering both ISMS and AIMS |
