## Clarify First

Before preparing a quality artifact, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Which deliverable** — management review, quality objectives, KPI framework, or culture assessment (each has a distinct workflow and output)
- [ ] **Review period and organizational scope** — the quarter/period and which sites/jurisdictions (drives which inputs and metrics are collected)
- [ ] **Clause 5.6.2 inputs available** — audit results, customer feedback, CAPA status, prior actions (determines whether the management review is complete)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the deliverable.

## Management Review Workflow

The agent conducts management reviews per ISO 13485 Clause 5.6 requirements.

### Workflow: Prepare and Execute Management Review

1. **Schedule management review** -- minimum annually per ISO 13485; quarterly or semi-annual cadence recommended for active QMS.
2. **Notify required attendees** minimum 2 weeks prior -- CEO/GM, department heads, RA Manager, Production Manager, Customer Quality lead.
3. **Collect required inputs** from process owners:
   - Audit results (internal and external)
   - Customer feedback (complaints, satisfaction, returns)
   - Process performance and product conformity
   - CAPA status and effectiveness
   - Previous review action items
   - Changes affecting QMS (regulatory, organizational)
   - Recommendations for improvement
4. **Compile input summary report** with trend analysis covering the review period.
5. **Prepare presentation materials** with supporting data and visualizations.
6. **Distribute agenda and input package** 1 week prior to the meeting.
7. **Conduct review meeting** per agenda -- ensure all required inputs are discussed.
8. **Validation checkpoint:** All ISO 13485 Clause 5.6.2 inputs reviewed; decisions documented with owners and due dates; outputs satisfy Clause 5.6.3 requirements.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Management review tracker shows "Not Collected" for all inputs | Input data JSON is empty or incorrectly structured | Verify the JSON file contains `inputs` with `topic`, `responsible`, `status`, and `data_period` fields. Use `--summary` to check the expected structure. |
| Action items all showing as "Overdue" | Due dates in the data file are in the past with no completion dates | Update completed actions with `completion_date` and change status to `Complete` or `Verified`. For genuinely overdue items, escalate per the performance response matrix. |
| Metrics summary produces zeros for all KPIs | Metrics section missing from review data JSON | Add a `metrics` object with fields for `complaint_rate`, `capa_open`, `capa_effectiveness`, `first_pass_yield`, `customer_satisfaction`, and `training_compliance`. |
| Quality culture survey response rate below 60% | Survey not communicated effectively or confidentiality concerns | Re-communicate the survey purpose with explicit confidentiality assurances. Extend the response window. Consider anonymous submission to increase participation. |
| Quality objectives not measurable | Objectives written as aspirational statements rather than SMART criteria | Rewrite each objective with a quantifiable target, baseline, owner, timeline, and measurement method per the SMART format documented in this skill. |
| KPI dashboard shows conflicting trends | Data collected from multiple sources with different time periods | Standardize data collection periods across all KPI sources. Ensure all metrics use the same calendar quarter or review period boundaries. |
| Inspection readiness checklist incomplete | Multiple departments not providing status updates | Assign a readiness coordinator per department. Conduct weekly readiness stand-ups in the 30 days before an expected inspection. |
