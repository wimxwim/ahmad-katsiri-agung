# Head of Regulatory Affairs

Regulatory strategy development, submission management, and global market access for medical device organizations.

---

## Clarify First

Before developing the regulatory strategy, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Device classification and intended use** — risk level and what the device does (drives the pathway: 510(k)/De Novo/PMA and MDR class)
- [ ] **Target markets** — US, EU, Canada, Japan, China… (determines which regulations apply and the submission sequencing)
- [ ] **Predicate availability** — whether a suitable predicate exists or the device is novel (selects 510(k) vs De Novo/PMA)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the strategy.

## Regulatory Strategy Workflow

The agent develops regulatory strategy aligned with business objectives and product characteristics.

### Workflow: New Product Regulatory Strategy

1. **Gather product information** -- collect intended use, device classification (risk level), technology platform, target markets, and timeline from stakeholders.
2. **Identify applicable regulations** per target market:
   - FDA (US): 21 CFR Part 820, 510(k)/PMA/De Novo
   - EU: MDR 2017/745, Notified Body requirements
   - Other markets: Health Canada, PMDA, NMPA, TGA
3. **Determine optimal regulatory pathway** using the pathway selection matrix below -- compare submission types, assess predicate device availability, evaluate clinical evidence requirements.
4. **Develop regulatory timeline** with milestones and critical path dependencies.
5. **Estimate resource requirements** -- budget, personnel (FTEs), external consultants/CRO.
6. **Identify regulatory risks** and define mitigation strategies for each.
7. **Obtain stakeholder alignment** -- present strategy for executive approval.
8. **Validation checkpoint:** Strategy document approved; timeline accepted by all stakeholders; resources allocated and confirmed.

### Regulatory Pathway Selection Matrix

| Factor | 510(k) | De Novo | PMA |
|--------|--------|---------|-----|
| Predicate Available | Yes | No | N/A |
| Risk Level | Low-Moderate | Low-Moderate | High |
| Clinical Data | Usually not required | May be required | Required |
| Review Time | 90 days (MDUFA) | 150 days | 180 days |
| User Fee | ~$22K (2024) | ~$135K | ~$440K |
| Best For | Me-too devices | Novel low-risk | High-risk, novel |

### Example: Regulatory Strategy Output

```
REGULATORY STRATEGY

Product: CardioSense Wearable ECG Monitor
Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-03-12

1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW
   - Intended use: Continuous ECG monitoring for arrhythmia detection
   - Device classification: Class II (FDA), Class IIa (EU MDR)
   - Technology: Single-lead ECG with ML-based AF detection

2. TARGET MARKETS
   | Market | Priority | Timeline    |

   | EU     | 2        | Q1 2027     |
   | Canada | 3        | Q2 2027     |

3. REGULATORY PATHWAY
   - FDA: 510(k) — Predicate: AliveCor KardiaMobile (K142743)
   - EU: Class IIa via Annex IX (QMS) + Annex XI Part A (Product)
   - Rationale: Established predicate supports SE argument;
     MDR IIa classification per Rule 10 (active diagnostic)

4. CLINICAL EVIDENCE STRATEGY
   - Requirements: SE comparison + analytical performance data
   - Approach: Literature review for AF detection + bench study

5. RISKS AND MITIGATION
   | Risk                     | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                    |
   |--------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------|
   | FDA requests clinical    | Medium      | High   | Pre-Sub meeting to align      |
   | NB capacity delay        | High        | Medium | Engage NB by Q4 2025         |
   | ML algorithm as SaMD     | Medium      | High   | Follow FDA AI/ML SaMD guidance|
```

3. **Compile submission package:**
   - Cover letter and administrative information
   - Device description and intended use
   - Substantial equivalence comparison
   - Performance testing data
   - Biocompatibility (if patient contact, per ISO 10993)
   - Software documentation (if applicable, per IEC 62304)
   - Labeling and IFU
4. **Conduct internal review** -- quality check all sections against FDA checklist.
5. **Prepare eCopy** per current FDA format requirements.
6. **Submit via FDA ESG portal** with user fee payment.
7. **Monitor MDUFA clock** and respond to AI/RTA requests within deadline.
8. **Validation checkpoint:** Submission accepted (RTA complete); MDUFA goal date received; tracking system updated.

### Workflow: PMA Submission

1. **Confirm PMA pathway** -- Class III device or no suitable predicate; clinical data strategy defined.
2. **Complete IDE clinical study** if required -- IDE approval, protocol execution, study report.
3. **Conduct Pre-Submission meeting** with FDA.
4. **Compile PMA submission** -- administrative/device information, manufacturing information, nonclinical studies, clinical studies, labeling.
5. **Submit original PMA** application.
6. **Address FDA questions** and deficiency letters within specified timeframes.
7. **Prepare for FDA facility inspection** -- coordinate with Quality team.
8. **Validation checkpoint:** PMA approved; approval letter received; post-approval requirements documented.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Regulatory tracker shows "No existing data file found" | Data file does not exist at the expected path | Create an initial submissions JSON file or use the tracker to add a first submission. The tool creates the file on first save. |
| Submission status shows as PLANNING when it should be SUBMITTED | Status not updated after submission | Update the submission record with `submission_status: SUBMITTED` and `submission_date`. The tracker does not auto-detect FDA ESG submission status. |
| Overdue notification fires for approved submission | `actual_approval_date` field not populated | Update the record with the actual approval date. The tracker compares `target_approval_date` against today when `actual_approval_date` is null. |
| 510(k) pathway selected but clinical data still needed | Novel technology or uncertain predicate | Schedule a Pre-Submission (Q-Sub) meeting with FDA. Novel technologies or complex testing may require clinical evidence even under the 510(k) pathway. |
| Notified Body timeline exceeds plan | NB capacity constraints (common in 2025-2026) | Engage the NB as early as possible (6+ months before target submission). The number of designated MDR NBs has grown to ~50 as of 2024, but capacity remains tight for complex device classes. |
| EUDAMED registration blocked | EUDAMED modules not yet mandatory or data upload issues | Develop a secure process for uploading device data into EUDAMED. Certain modules become mandatory in 2026. Prepare data structures proactively. |
| Multi-market submission timeline keeps slipping | Sequential submissions creating cascading delays | Where possible, shift to parallel submission strategy. Use FDA + EU as reference markets and leverage MDSAP for recognition markets (Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil). |
