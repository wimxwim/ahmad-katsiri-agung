## Clarify First

Before scoring the vendor, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Is the service critical/essential** — the `--critical` flag applies a 2x weight to security and compliance, which can flip the composite score and the Approve/Reject recommendation
- [ ] **Applicable regulatory frameworks** — GDPR, DORA, NIS2, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001/SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP — selects which compliance checklists run
- [ ] **Questionnaire responses + independent evidence** — the 6-dimension scores; self-reported-only data inflates scores, so confirm whether SOC 2 / pen-test / financial evidence backs them

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the assessment.

## Tools

### 1. Vendor Risk Scorer (`scripts/vendor_risk_scorer.py`)

Scores a vendor across 6 risk dimensions based on questionnaire responses. Calculates weighted composite score with 2x multiplier for critical services. Generates risk heat map and overall recommendation.

```bash
# Score a vendor from questionnaire responses
python scripts/vendor_risk_scorer.py vendor_responses.json

# JSON output for dashboards
python scripts/vendor_risk_scorer.py vendor_responses.json --json

# Flag as critical service (2x weight on security + compliance)
python scripts/vendor_risk_scorer.py vendor_responses.json --critical
```

### 2. Vendor Comparison (`scripts/vendor_comparison.py`)

Takes multiple vendor risk assessment JSONs and generates a side-by-side comparison matrix. Ranks vendors by composite score and recommends preferred vendor with rationale.

```bash
# Compare two vendors
python scripts/vendor_comparison.py vendor_a.json vendor_b.json

# Compare multiple vendors with JSON output
python scripts/vendor_comparison.py vendor_a.json vendor_b.json vendor_c.json --json

# Compare with critical service weighting
python scripts/vendor_comparison.py vendor_a.json vendor_b.json --critical
```

## Reference Guides

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `references/risk_assessment_framework.md` | 6-dimension scoring system, weighting methodology, composite score interpretation |
| `references/regulatory_checklists.md` | Pre-built compliance checklists for GDPR, DORA, NIS2, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001/SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP |
| `references/monitoring_framework.md` | Quarterly reviews, Early Warning Indicators, KPI metrics, risk mitigation strategies, onboarding checklists |

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Three-Phase Vendor Assessment

**Phase 1: Initial Screening (Days 1-5)**
1. Gather basic vendor information (company profile, financial health, certifications)
2. Run `vendor_risk_scorer.py` with preliminary data for initial risk classification
3. Check applicable regulatory frameworks from `regulatory_checklists.md`
4. Decision gate: Proceed to detailed assessment or reject early

**Phase 2: Detailed Assessment (Days 5-15)**
1. Issue comprehensive vendor questionnaire covering all 6 risk dimensions
2. Run `vendor_risk_scorer.py` with complete questionnaire responses
3. Execute regulatory compliance checklists for all applicable frameworks
4. Request supporting documentation (SOC 2 reports, pen test results, financials)
5. Conduct reference checks and public record searches

**Phase 3: Final Evaluation (Days 15-20)**
1. Run `vendor_comparison.py` if evaluating multiple vendors
2. Compile Vendor Risk Report with dimension breakdowns
3. Document gaps and required mitigations from `risk_assessment_framework.md`
4. Present recommendation (Approve / Approve with Conditions / Reject)
5. If approved, generate onboarding checklist from `monitoring_framework.md`

### Workflow 2: Competitive Vendor Selection

1. **Define requirements** -- Document must-have and nice-to-have criteria mapped to risk dimensions
2. **Screen candidates** -- Run initial scoring on all candidates; eliminate any with Critical risk
3. **Deep-dive finalists** -- Full 6-dimension assessment on top 2-3 vendors
4. **Compare** -- Run `vendor_comparison.py` on finalist assessments
5. **Negotiate** -- Use risk findings as leverage in contract negotiations (integrates with `tech-contract-negotiation` skill)
6. **Select and onboard** -- Approve preferred vendor; set up monitoring per `monitoring_framework.md`

### Workflow 3: Ongoing Vendor Monitoring

1. **Quarterly review** -- Re-score vendor using updated data; compare against baseline
2. **Event-triggered review** -- Re-assess on M&A, breaches, regulatory changes, or leadership turnover
3. **Annual re-assessment** -- Full 6-dimension re-evaluation with updated questionnaire
4. **Early Warning response** -- Monitor indicators from `monitoring_framework.md`; escalate per defined paths
5. **Exit planning** -- If risk exceeds threshold, activate exit provisions and dual-source strategy

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| All dimensions score 1 (Low Risk) | Vendor self-reported optimistically on questionnaire | Cross-reference with SOC 2 reports, pen test results, and financial filings; adjust scores based on evidence |
| Composite score doesn't reflect known security issues | Security dimension not weighted for critical service | Re-run with `--critical` flag to apply 2x multiplier on security and compliance dimensions |
| Comparison matrix shows all vendors tied | Scoring inputs are too similar or too coarse | Request more granular data; use the 5-level scoring criteria from the risk framework to differentiate |
| Regulatory checklist seems incomplete for your industry | Only 8 frameworks are pre-built | Customize checklists by adding industry-specific requirements as additional items |
| Vendor refuses to complete questionnaire | Vendor sees assessment as overly burdensome | Share only the dimensions relevant to their service scope; offer to accept SOC 2/ISO 27001 reports as partial substitutes |
| Risk score changed dramatically between quarters | Major event occurred (breach, M&A, leadership change) | This is expected behavior; document the trigger event and follow the event-triggered review process |

## Success Criteria

- **Assessment Completeness**: 100% of vendor assessments cover all 6 risk dimensions with evidence-backed scores
- **Timeline Adherence**: Three-phase assessment completed within 20 business days for 90% of evaluations
- **Risk Prediction Accuracy**: Vendors flagged as High/Critical risk experience 3x more incidents than Low risk vendors over 12 months
- **Regulatory Coverage**: All applicable regulatory checklists completed with zero missed frameworks for 95% of assessments
- **Comparison Consistency**: Vendor comparison rankings remain stable when re-scored by different assessors (inter-rater reliability > 85%)
- **Monitoring Compliance**: 100% of quarterly reviews completed on schedule with documented findings
- **Early Warning Detection**: 80%+ of vendor incidents preceded by at least one Early Warning Indicator flagged in monitoring

## Scope & Limitations

**This skill covers:**
- Multi-factor risk scoring across 6 dimensions (Financial, Operational, Compliance, Security, Reputational, Strategic) with critical-service weighting
- Regulatory compliance checklists for GDPR, DORA, NIS2, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001/SOC 2, HIPAA, and FedRAMP
- Side-by-side vendor comparison with composite ranking and dimension-level analysis
- Ongoing monitoring framework with quarterly reviews, Early Warning Indicators, and escalation paths
- Risk mitigation strategies and onboarding checklists by risk level

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Real-time vendor monitoring dashboards, automated data feeds, or integration with GRC platforms (all input is via JSON files)
- Financial auditing, forensic accounting, or detailed financial statement analysis of vendors (use the `finance/financial-analyst` skill)
- Physical security assessments, on-site facility audits, or hardware supply chain verification
- Legal review of vendor contracts or negotiation of terms (use the `legal/tech-contract-negotiation` skill)
- Vendor relationship management, performance optimization, or strategic partnership development beyond risk assessment

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Relying solely on vendor self-assessment questionnaires | Vendors underreport risks; no independent verification | Cross-reference questionnaire responses with SOC 2/ISO 27001 reports, pen test results, and public records |
| Applying the same weight to all dimensions regardless of service type | A payroll vendor and a marketing tool have different risk profiles | Use `--critical` flag for critical services; adjust dimension weights based on service classification |
| Completing due diligence once and never revisiting | Vendor risk changes over time due to M&A, breaches, market shifts | Implement quarterly monitoring with annual re-assessment per the monitoring framework |
| Rejecting vendors for a single high-risk dimension without considering mitigations | Eliminates potentially strong vendors with addressable gaps | Use the gap analysis severity classification; require remediation plans for major concerns before final decision |
| Skipping the comparison matrix for sole-source procurements | Misses opportunity to benchmark the vendor against market standards | Run comparison against industry benchmarks or previous vendor assessments to establish a risk baseline |
