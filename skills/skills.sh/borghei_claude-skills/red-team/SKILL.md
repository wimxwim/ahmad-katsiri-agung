# Red Team

> **Category:** Engineering
> **Domain:** Offensive Security

## Overview

The **Red Team** skill provides tools for planning and scoping security engagements. It helps define rules of engagement, select methodologies, scope targets, plan attack phases, and generate engagement documentation.

## Clarify First

Before planning the engagement, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Authorization & ROE owner** — who has signed off and the escalation contacts (no engagement plan without confirmed authorization)
- [ ] **In-scope targets & boundaries** — the exact assets in and explicitly out of bounds (drives scope and `--target`)
- [ ] **Engagement type** — red-team / pentest / purple / bug-bounty (sets stealth, methodology, and `--type`)
- [ ] **Compliance framework** — e.g. pci-dss (maps test cases to controls via `--compliance`)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Plan a red team engagement
python scripts/engagement_planner.py --type red-team --target "web application" --duration 2w

# Plan a penetration test
python scripts/engagement_planner.py --type pentest --target "api,network" --duration 1w --compliance pci-dss

# Generate rules of engagement document
python scripts/engagement_planner.py --type red-team --target "full-org" --output engagement_plan.json --format json
```

## Tools Overview

| Tool | Purpose | Key Flags |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `engagement_planner.py` | Plan red team engagements with scope, rules, and methodology | `--type`, `--target`, `--duration`, `--compliance` |

### engagement_planner.py

Generates comprehensive engagement plans including:
- Scope definition and boundaries
- Rules of engagement (ROE)
- Methodology selection (MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP, PTES, etc.)
- Phase breakdown with timelines
- Communication and escalation procedures
- Deliverables checklist

## Workflows

### Full Red Team Engagement
1. Define engagement objectives and scope with `engagement_planner.py`
2. Review generated rules of engagement with stakeholders
3. Get formal sign-off on scope and ROE
4. Execute phases per the plan timeline
5. Document findings throughout
6. Deliver final report

### Compliance-Driven Pentest
1. Run planner with `--compliance` flag for framework-specific requirements
2. Map test cases to compliance controls
3. Execute against compliance-specific checklist
4. Generate evidence for auditors

## Reference Documentation

- [Red Team Methodology](references/red-team-methodology.md) - Frameworks, attack phases, and engagement standards

## Common Patterns

### Engagement Types
- **Red Team**: Full adversary simulation, stealth required, tests detection/response
- **Penetration Test**: Authorized vulnerability exploitation, known to defenders
- **Purple Team**: Collaborative attack/defense, real-time knowledge sharing
- **Bug Bounty Triage**: Structured vulnerability validation from external reports
