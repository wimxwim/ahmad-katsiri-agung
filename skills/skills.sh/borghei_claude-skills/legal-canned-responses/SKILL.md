# Legal Canned Responses Skill

## Overview

Production-ready toolkit for generating templated responses to common legal inquiries with built-in escalation detection. Covers 7 response categories with multiple sub-types each, plus a universal and category-specific escalation trigger system. Designed for legal operations teams handling high volumes of recurring inquiries while ensuring critical matters are routed to counsel.

## Clarify First

Before generating the response, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Inquiry category + sub-type** — DSR-acknowledgment vs subpoena-objection select completely different templates
- [ ] **The raw inquiry text** — required to run escalation detection first; a litigation, regulator, law-enforcement, or press trigger means STOP and route to counsel, not a templated reply
- [ ] **Substitution variables** — requestor name, dates, matter, and regulation — populate the response; missing values leave placeholders and the wrong timelines (GDPR 30-day vs CCPA 45-day)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the response.

## Tools

### 1. Response Generator (`scripts/response_generator.py`)

Generate formatted legal responses from templates with variable substitution and escalation detection.

```bash
python scripts/response_generator.py \
  --category dsr --sub-type acknowledgment \
  --var requestor_name="Jane Doe" \
  --var request_type="access" \
  --var request_date="2026-04-10"

python scripts/response_generator.py \
  --category nda --sub-type standard-form \
  --var counterparty="Acme Corp" \
  --var purpose="due diligence" --json

python scripts/response_generator.py \
  --category discovery --sub-type initial-notice \
  --var matter_name="Smith v. Corp" \
  --var custodians="Engineering,Sales"
```

### 2. Escalation Detector (`scripts/escalation_detector.py`)

Analyze inquiry text for escalation triggers and recommend routing.

```bash
python scripts/escalation_detector.py \
  --text "We received a subpoena from the DOJ regarding our pricing practices"

python scripts/escalation_detector.py \
  --text "A reporter from the Wall Street Journal is asking about our data practices" --json

python scripts/escalation_detector.py \
  --category vendor \
  --text "The vendor is threatening litigation over the contract dispute"
```

## Reference Guides

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `references/response_templates.md` | Complete templates for all 7 categories with sub-types |
| `references/escalation_triggers.md` | Universal and category-specific escalation triggers |

## Workflows

### Template Lifecycle

1. **Creation** -- Draft response template for identified recurring inquiry type
2. **Review** -- Legal counsel reviews template for accuracy, tone, and compliance
3. **Publication** -- Template added to system with metadata, variables, and triggers
4. **Use** -- Staff selects category/sub-type, fills variables, generates response
5. **Feedback** -- Track usage and collect feedback on template effectiveness
6. **Update** -- Revise templates based on feedback, legal changes, or policy updates
7. **Retirement** -- Archive templates that are no longer applicable

### Response Generation Workflow

1. **Classify Inquiry** -- Determine category (DSR, NDA, subpoena, etc.) and sub-type
2. **Check Escalation** -- Run escalation detector on inquiry text
3. **If Escalation Detected** -- Stop; route to counsel with escalation report
4. **If No Escalation** -- Generate response with appropriate template and variables
5. **Review & Send** -- Review generated response before sending; adjust if needed

## Response Categories

| Category | Sub-Types | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Data Subject Requests (DSR) | acknowledgment, verification, fulfillment, denial, extension | GDPR/CCPA data subject right requests |
| Discovery/Litigation Holds | initial-notice, reminder, modification, release | Litigation hold management |
| Privacy Inquiries | cookies, data-sharing, children, transfers | General privacy questions |
| Vendor Legal Questions | contract-status, amendments, certifications, audit | Vendor/supplier legal matters |
| NDA Requests | standard-form, counterparty-markup, decline, renewal | Non-disclosure agreement lifecycle |
| Subpoena/Legal Process | acknowledgment, objection, extension, compliance | Legal process responses |
| Insurance Notifications | initial-claim, supplemental-info, reservation-of-rights | Insurance claim management |

### DSR Sub-Types

| Sub-Type | Use When | Key Variables |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| acknowledgment | New DSR received | requestor_name, request_type, request_date |
| verification | Identity verification needed | requestor_name, verification_method |
| fulfillment | Request completed | requestor_name, request_type, data_description |
| denial | Request denied with reason | requestor_name, request_type, denial_reason |
| extension | Need more time | requestor_name, request_type, extension_reason, new_deadline |

### Discovery/Litigation Hold Sub-Types

| Sub-Type | Use When | Key Variables |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| initial-notice | New litigation hold issued | matter_name, custodians, data_types |
| reminder | Periodic hold reminder | matter_name, reminder_number |
| modification | Hold scope changed | matter_name, modification_description |
| release | Hold lifted | matter_name, release_date |

## Escalation System

### Universal Triggers (Always Escalate)

| # | Trigger | Why |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | Potential or active litigation | Legal exposure requires counsel assessment |
| 2 | Regulatory investigation or inquiry | Regulatory response requires strategic approach |
| 3 | Government or law enforcement contact | Constitutional and procedural rights at stake |
| 4 | Binding legal commitment requested | Cannot create legal obligations without counsel |
| 5 | Criminal liability exposure | Requires immediate counsel involvement |
| 6 | Media attention or press inquiry | Reputational risk requires coordinated response |
| 7 | Unprecedented or novel situation | No template exists; bespoke legal analysis needed |
| 8 | Multi-jurisdictional conflict | Cross-border legal complexity requires expert analysis |

### Escalation Response Protocol

1. **Stop** -- Do not send any templated response
2. **Alert** -- Notify designated counsel immediately
3. **Explain** -- Provide escalation context with matched triggers
4. **Recommend** -- Suggest routing based on trigger type
5. **Draft** -- Mark any preliminary draft "FOR COUNSEL REVIEW ONLY"

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Missing variable in output | Required variable not provided | Check template requirements; provide all required `--var` parameters |
| Wrong template selected | Category/sub-type mismatch | Review category descriptions; ensure sub-type matches inquiry type |
| False positive escalation | Common words matching trigger patterns | Provide `--category` to use category-specific triggers; review matched triggers |
| False negative escalation | Inquiry text too vague | Add more context to inquiry text; run both universal and category-specific checks |
| Template too generic | Using default values | Replace all placeholder values with actual organization-specific details |
| Discovery hold sent to wrong custodians | Custodian list outdated | Verify custodian list against current employees and systems |
| Subpoena response not flagged | Missing category context | Always use `--category subpoena` for legal process; subpoena category always escalates |
| Response tone inappropriate | Wrong audience context | Select appropriate sub-type; customize tone per audience |

## Success Criteria

- **Response Time**: Templated responses generated within 5 minutes vs. 30+ minutes manual drafting
- **Escalation Accuracy**: 100% of genuine escalation triggers detected (zero false negatives on CRITICAL triggers)
- **Template Coverage**: Templates cover 80%+ of recurring legal inquiry types
- **Consistency**: All responses within a category use consistent language, tone, and legal caveats
- **Audit Trail**: Every generated response logged with category, sub-type, date, and escalation status

## Scope & Limitations

**This skill covers:**
- Template-based response generation for 7 common legal inquiry categories
- Escalation detection using keyword and pattern matching against known triggers
- Variable substitution for organization-specific customization
- Response metadata generation for audit trail purposes

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Legal advice or attorney-client privileged analysis
- Automated sending of responses (generation only; human review required)
- Contract drafting, negotiation, or legal document creation
- Case management, docketing, or deadline tracking
- Jurisdiction-specific legal compliance validation of response content

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Sending templated response without review | May miss context-specific nuances; legal risk | Always review generated response before sending |
| Ignoring escalation triggers | Critical matters mishandled; legal exposure | Run escalation detector on every inquiry; treat all triggers seriously |
| Using templates for novel situations | Templates assume standard scenarios; novel situations need bespoke analysis | Escalate novel situations to counsel; create new template after resolution |
| Hardcoding organization details in templates | Templates become non-portable; updates missed | Use variable substitution; maintain variables in configuration |
| Skipping identity verification for DSRs | GDPR/CCPA require verification before fulfillment | Always send verification sub-type before fulfillment |
