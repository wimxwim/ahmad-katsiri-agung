# EU AI Act Compliance Specialist

Production-ready compliance patterns for Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 -- the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. Covers risk classification, provider/deployer obligations, GPAI model requirements, conformity assessment, and AI governance.

---

## Clarify First

Before classifying or mapping obligations, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Intended purpose and domain** — what the system does and its Annex III area (drives the risk classification and which obligations apply)
- [ ] **Role** — provider, deployer, GPAI provider, or importer (determines the obligation set)
- [ ] **Biometric / GPAI characteristics** — uses biometrics, is a GPAI model, or trained with >10^25 FLOPs (drives the prohibited / high-risk / systemic-risk path and the conformity-assessment route)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the classification.

## AI System Inventory and Classification Workflow

The agent classifies AI systems under the EU AI Act's risk-based framework and maps applicable obligations.

### Workflow: Classify and Map Obligations

1. **Inventory all AI systems** -- for each system, document: name, provider/developer, description, intended purpose, deployment status, affected persons, geographic scope, data processed, and decision impact level.
2. **Apply classification decision tree** to each system:
   - Does it meet the Art. 3(1) definition of an AI system? If no, document exclusion.
   - Does it fall under a prohibited practice (Art. 5)? If yes, flag as UNACCEPTABLE RISK -- must be discontinued.
   - Is it a safety component of an Annex I product? If yes, HIGH-RISK (product legislation path).
   - Does it fall under an Annex III category? If yes, apply Art. 6(3) exception analysis. If exception does not apply, HIGH-RISK.
   - Does Art. 50 transparency obligation apply? If yes, LIMITED RISK. Otherwise, MINIMAL RISK.
3. **Map obligations** based on classification -- assign compliance owners for each obligation.
4. **Run gap analysis** using `scripts/ai_compliance_checker.py` to identify compliance gaps.
5. **Prioritize remediation** by deadline urgency, penalty severity, and number of affected persons.
6. **Validation checkpoint:** Every AI system classified; prohibited practices flagged for immediate action; high-risk systems have assigned compliance owners and remediation timelines.

---

## Conformity Assessment Workflow

The agent guides organizations through conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems.

### Workflow: Internal Control (Annex VI)

1. **Establish QMS** per Art. 17 -- document design, development, testing, data management, and post-market monitoring processes.
2. **Compile technical documentation** per Art. 11 -- system description, development process, risk management, data governance, performance metrics.
3. **Implement all Chapter III Section 2 requirements** -- verify each obligation is addressed.
4. **Conduct internal assessment:**
   - Verify risk management system addresses all identified risks (Art. 9)
   - Verify data governance meets Art. 10 requirements
   - Verify technical documentation is complete and current (Art. 11)
   - Verify logging capability (Art. 12)
   - Verify transparency and instructions for use (Art. 13)
   - Verify human oversight design (Art. 14)
   - Verify accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity (Art. 15)
   - Confirm QMS covers all required elements (Art. 17)
5. **Sign EU Declaration of Conformity** (Art. 47), affix CE marking (Art. 48), register in EU database (Art. 49).
6. **Implement post-market monitoring** (Art. 72) and maintain documentation updates.
7. **Validation checkpoint:** All 12 provider obligations verified; declaration signed; CE marking affixed; EU database registration complete; post-market monitoring operational.

### Workflow: Third-Party Assessment (Annex VII)

7. **Validation checkpoint:** Notified body certificates issued; CE marking with NB number affixed; ongoing surveillance scheduled.

---

## Bias Detection and Fairness Testing

The agent performs bias detection per Art. 10 data governance requirements.

### Workflow: Bias Testing

1. **Define protected attributes** -- age, gender, ethnicity, disability, religion, and other relevant characteristics for the system's context.
2. **Analyze data distribution** -- check representation ratios (target: 0.8-1.25 vs. population), class imbalance ratios (>0.5), and coverage of all known groups.
3. **Evaluate outcome fairness** using these metrics:
   - Demographic parity: P(positive outcome) equal across groups (within 80% / four-fifths rule)
   - Equalized odds: TPR and FPR equal across groups (within 80%)
   - Predictive parity: PPV equal across groups (within 80%)
   - Calibration: Predicted probabilities accurate for all groups (within 5pp)
4. **Identify proxy variables** -- check for features correlated with protected attributes.
5. **Implement mitigation** -- data augmentation, re-sampling, re-weighting, adversarial debiasing, threshold adjustment, or reject option classification as appropriate.
6. **Validate** -- re-run analysis to confirm improvement.
7. **Document** -- record all findings, measures taken, and residual bias levels in technical documentation.
8. **Validation checkpoint:** All protected attributes tested; fairness metrics within thresholds or residual bias documented with justification; mitigation measures recorded.

### Example: Bias Detection Command

```bash
# Analyze dataset statistics for bias indicators
python scripts/ai_bias_detector.py --input dataset_stats.json \
  --protected-attributes gender,age_group,ethnicity

# Output as JSON for integration with compliance documentation
python scripts/ai_bias_detector.py --input dataset_stats.json --json
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| AI system classified as HIGH-RISK but organization believes it qualifies for Art. 6(3) exception | Exception analysis incomplete or domain mapping incorrect | Re-evaluate against all Art. 6(3) exception criteria; the system must perform a narrow procedural task, improve the result of a previously completed human activity, or be purely preparatory; document rationale with legal review |
| Bias detector reports disparate impact but model performs well overall | Aggregated metrics mask subgroup disparities; four-fifths rule violation on specific protected attributes | Analyze per-group positive outcome rates using `--protected-attributes` flag; implement targeted mitigation (re-sampling, threshold adjustment) for affected groups; document residual bias with justification |
| Compliance checker returns low score despite extensive documentation | Documentation exists but key compliance fields marked as incomplete or not up to date | Verify each obligation field in the input JSON reflects current state; ensure `kept_up_to_date` and `lifecycle_coverage` flags are set; update technical documentation per Art. 11 before reassessment |
| System falls under multiple Annex III categories simultaneously | AI system serves multiple domains (e.g., employment + education) | Classify under the highest-risk applicable category; apply the most stringent obligations; document classification rationale for each category |
| GPAI model obligations unclear for downstream provider | Upstream GPAI provider has not supplied sufficient documentation per Art. 53 | Request technical documentation, training data summary, and copyright compliance information from the GPAI provider; if unavailable, document the gap and assess independent obligations |
| Conformity assessment route uncertain (internal vs. third-party) | Biometric identification system or insufficient harmonized standards | Biometric ID systems (Annex III point 1) require third-party assessment (Annex VII); all others may use internal control (Annex VI) unless harmonized standards are unavailable; consult notified body |
| Post-market monitoring shows model performance degradation | Data drift, concept drift, or deployment context changed since initial assessment | Trigger Art. 72 post-market monitoring procedures; report serious incidents within 15 days; update risk management system and technical documentation; consider re-running conformity assessment |

---

## Success Criteria

- **All AI systems inventoried and classified** -- every system assessed against the risk-based framework with documented classification rationale, including Art. 6(3) exception analysis where applicable
- **Prohibited practices identified and discontinued** -- all Art. 5 prohibited practices flagged by February 2, 2025, with documented evidence of discontinuation or lawful exception application
- **High-risk systems fully compliant by August 2, 2026** -- all 12 provider obligations verified, EU Declaration of Conformity signed, CE marking affixed, and EU database registration complete
- **Bias testing completed for all high-risk systems** -- demographic parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity metrics within four-fifths threshold for all protected attributes, or residual bias documented with justification
- **GPAI model obligations met by August 2, 2025** -- technical documentation maintained, downstream provider information supplied, copyright compliance verified, and training data summary published
- **Conformity assessment completed per correct route** -- internal control (Annex VI) or third-party assessment (Annex VII) selected based on system classification, with all certificates issued and filed

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- AI system risk classification across all four tiers (Prohibited, High-Risk, Limited Risk, Minimal Risk)
- Annex III category analysis and Art. 6(3) exception evaluation
- Provider and deployer obligation mapping with compliance gap analysis
- GPAI model classification including systemic risk determination (10^25 FLOPs threshold)
- Bias detection and fairness testing mapped to Art. 10 data governance requirements
- Conformity assessment workflow guidance (Annex VI internal control and Annex VII third-party)
- Implementation timeline tracking with penalty exposure assessment

**Out of Scope:**
- Actual ML model training, retraining, or adversarial testing -- this skill provides compliance frameworks, not ML engineering tools
- Notified body selection, engagement, or audit execution
- National regulatory sandbox applications or experimental AI system exemptions
- Detailed GPAI Code of Practice implementation beyond obligation mapping
- CE marking physical affixation or EU database registration system interaction
- Legal advice on liability, insurance, or contractual allocation of AI Act obligations

**Important Notes:**
- The EU AI Act compliance deadline of August 2, 2026 for high-risk systems is firm -- organizations should begin classification and gap analysis immediately
- Penalties are severe: up to EUR 35 million or 7% of global turnover for prohibited practices, EUR 15 million or 3% for high-risk non-compliance
- SMEs and startups receive proportionate penalty treatment (lower of absolute or percentage)
