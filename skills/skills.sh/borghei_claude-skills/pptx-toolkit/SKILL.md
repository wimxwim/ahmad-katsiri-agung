# Pptx Toolkit

Audit `.pptx` files using the standard library only — no `python-pptx` required. Reads OOXML directly via `zipfile` + `xml.etree`.

## Clarify First

Before running the audit, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Deck purpose (board/investor, sales, or conference talk)** — sets the density caps, speaker-notes coverage, and animation limits (the rubric differs per type)
- [ ] **Delivery context (sent to be read vs presented live from notes)** — changes whether bare slides and animations are acceptable
- [ ] **Whether hidden slides should ship** — distinguishes intentional backup slides from leftover narrative cruft

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Quick Start

```bash
python scripts/pptx_auditor.py deck.pptx
```

Outputs: slide count, hidden slide count, slides with speaker notes, words per slide (with per-slide breakdown), image and embedded-media count, animation node count, theme name.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Pre-Meeting Deck Review

**Goal:** Catch the issues that make decks look unprofessional in the room — overstuffed slides, missing speaker notes, leftover hidden slides from prior versions.

**Steps:**
1. Run audit
2. Slides with > 50 words → flag for content reduction
3. Slides without speaker notes for a board / investor deck → add notes or mark "intentionally bare"
4. Hidden slides → confirm they should ship hidden, or delete
5. Animation count > 100 across deck → likely over-animated; trim

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes per deck.

### Workflow 2: Board / Investor Deck Audit

**Goal:** Hold a board / investor deck to a higher quality bar with a structured audit trail.

**Steps:**
1. Run audit; export JSON for archival alongside the deck
2. Apply the rubric in `references/deck_density_rubric.md`
3. Flag slides over density caps; trim to one idea per slide
4. Pair with `cs-board-deck-builder` skill for narrative review

**Time Estimate:** 30-60 minutes per board deck.

### Workflow 3: Pre-Conference Talk Deck Check

**Goal:** Stage-ready deck — hidden / cut slides removed, speaker notes complete, animations rehearsable.

**Steps:**
1. Audit; ensure slide count matches dry-run timing budget
2. Speaker notes coverage > 90% (for talks where you'll deliver from notes)
3. Animations under 50 across the talk (more invites timing accidents on stage)
4. Embedded video / audio: confirm present and play locally

**Time Estimate:** 15 minutes pre-rehearsal.

## Tools

### pptx_auditor.py

Reads a `.pptx` file as a ZIP archive and parses OOXML directly. No external dependencies.

```bash
python scripts/pptx_auditor.py deck.pptx
python scripts/pptx_auditor.py deck.pptx --json
```

**Reports:**
- Slide count and hidden-slide count
- Slides with speaker notes (count and percentage)
- Words per slide (mean, max, full distribution)
- Top-N densest slides
- Image / embedded-media count
- Animation timing node count
- Theme name

---

## Reference Guides

- **`references/deck_density_rubric.md`** — Words-per-slide guidance by deck purpose (board, sales, talk, training); animation philosophy; speaker-notes pattern

---

## Templates

- **`assets/deck_handoff_checklist.md`** — Pre-meeting deck sign-off checklist

---

## Best Practices

- **One idea per slide.** If you can't summarize the slide in one sentence, it has more than one idea.
- **Speaker notes are documentation.** Slides without notes leave readers (post-meeting) guessing what the talk track was.
- **Delete hidden slides before sending.** Hidden slides are often older versions left for "just in case" — they survive forever and leak narrative context.
- **Animations are timing risk.** Every animation is a place where the live demo can desync from the speaker.

## Integration Points

- Pairs with `c-level-advisor/board-deck-builder` for board / investor decks
- Pairs with `marketing/launch-strategy` for launch-deck reviews
- Used by `cs-pr-comms-lead` for press / partner decks
