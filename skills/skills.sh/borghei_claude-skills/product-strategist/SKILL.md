## Clarify First

Before generating the OKRs or analysis, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Strategy type** — growth, retention, revenue, innovation, or operational (selects the OKR template and objectives)
- [ ] **Current and target metrics** — e.g. MAU 100k→150k, NPS 40→60 (drives measurable key results)
- [ ] **Team structure** — the teams receiving cascaded OKRs (drives the cascade and balance scoring)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Quick Start

### Generate OKRs for Your Team

```bash
# Growth strategy with default teams
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth

# Retention strategy with custom teams
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py retention --teams "Engineering,Design,Data"

# Revenue strategy with 40% product contribution
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py revenue --contribution 0.4

# Export as JSON for integration
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth --json > okrs.json
```

---

## Workflow: Strategic Planning Session

A step-by-step guide for running a quarterly strategic planning session.

### Step 1: Define Strategic Focus

Choose the primary strategy type based on company priorities:

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Growth** | Scaling user base, market expansion |
| **Retention** | Reducing churn, improving LTV |
| **Revenue** | Increasing ARPU, new monetization |
| **Innovation** | Market differentiation, new capabilities |
| **Operational** | Improving efficiency, scaling operations |

See `references/strategy_types.md` for detailed guidance on each strategy.

### Step 2: Gather Input Metrics

Collect current state metrics to inform OKR targets:

```bash
# Example metrics JSON
{
  "current": 100000,      # Current MAU
  "target": 150000,       # Target MAU
  "current_nps": 40,      # Current NPS
  "target_nps": 60        # Target NPS
}
```

### Step 3: Configure Team Structure

Define the teams that will receive cascaded OKRs:

```bash
# Default teams
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth

# Custom teams for your organization
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth --teams "Core,Platform,Mobile,AI"
```

### Step 4: Generate OKR Cascade

Run the generator to create aligned OKRs:

```bash
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth --contribution 0.3
```

### Step 5: Review Alignment Scores

Check the alignment scores in the output:

| Score | Target | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Vertical Alignment | >90% | Ensure all objectives link to parent |
| Horizontal Alignment | >75% | Check for team coordination |
| Coverage | >80% | Validate all company OKRs are addressed |
| Balance | >80% | Redistribute if one team is overloaded |
| **Overall** | **>80%** | Good alignment; <60% needs restructuring |

### Step 6: Refine and Validate

Before finalizing:

- [ ] Review generated objectives with stakeholders
- [ ] Adjust team assignments based on capacity
- [ ] Validate contribution percentages are realistic
- [ ] Ensure no conflicting objectives across teams
- [ ] Set up tracking cadence (bi-weekly check-ins)

### Step 7: Export and Track

Export OKRs for your tracking system:

```bash
# JSON for tools like Lattice, Ally, Workboard
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth --json > q1_okrs.json
```

## PESTEL Analysis Framework

Evaluate macro-environment forces that impact product strategy. PESTEL is a decision lens, not a checklist -- use it to inform roadmap decisions, identify threats before they materialize, and spot opportunities competitors miss.

### When to Use

- Annual/quarterly strategic planning sessions.
- Entering a new market or geography.
- Evaluating regulatory or economic changes that affect your product.
- Pre-investment analysis for new product lines.

### PESTEL Template

```markdown
## PESTEL Analysis

**Product/Company:** [Name]
**Analysis Purpose:** [Decision this analysis informs]
**Time Horizon:** [e.g., 12 months, 3 years]
**Geography/Scope:** [e.g., US, EU, Global]

### 1. Political Factors
| Factor | Impact | Opp/Threat | Product Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Government policies | | | |
| Political stability | | | |
| Trade regulations | | | |
| Taxation policy | | | |

### 2. Economic Factors
| Factor | Impact | Opp/Threat | Product Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Economic growth | | | |
| Inflation rate | | | |
| Exchange rates | | | |
| Consumer spending | | | |

### 3. Social Factors
| Factor | Impact | Opp/Threat | Product Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Demographics | | | |
| Cultural trends | | | |
| Lifestyle changes | | | |
| Consumer attitudes | | | |

### 4. Technological Factors
| Factor | Impact | Opp/Threat | Product Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tech advancements | | | |
| R&D activity | | | |
| Automation | | | |
| Digital transformation | | | |

### 5. Environmental Factors
| Factor | Impact | Opp/Threat | Product Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Climate change | | | |
| Sustainability | | | |
| Resource scarcity | | | |
| Environmental regs | | | |

### 6. Legal Factors
| Factor | Impact | Opp/Threat | Product Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compliance requirements | | | |
| IP rights | | | |
| Employment laws | | | |
| Health & safety regs | | | |

### Strategic Synthesis
- **Top 3 Opportunities:** [List]
- **Top 3 Threats:** [List]
- **Strategic Implications for Product:** [List]

### Assumptions to Validate
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]
```

### Next Steps After PESTEL

1. Generate a mitigation and monitoring plan (Recommended)
2. Convert into a one-page executive risk brief
3. Generate scenario planning for best/base/worst case
4. Map top threats into roadmap guardrails

## TAM-SAM-SOM Market Sizing

Estimate market size for product opportunities using Total Addressable Market, Serviceable Available Market, and Serviceable Obtainable Market analysis.

### When to Use

- Evaluating new product or feature investment.
- Preparing investor or board presentations.
- Comparing market opportunities across product lines.
- Go-to-market planning and resource allocation.

### Market Sizing Framework

#### Step 1: Define the Problem Space

Describe the problem your product solves. Be specific about the job-to-be-done, not the product category.

#### Step 2: Define Geographic Scope

Specify the geographic region (e.g., US, Europe, Global) and relevant data sources:

| Region | Primary Data Sources |
|---|---|
| US | Census Bureau, BLS, industry trade orgs |
| Europe | Eurostat, local statistical agencies |
| Global | World Bank, IMF, global industry reports |

#### Step 3: Identify Industry Segments

What specific industry or market segments does this problem relate to?

#### Step 4: Define Customer Profile

Who are the potential customers? Define by problem characteristics, not demographics.

### TAM-SAM-SOM Template

```markdown
## Market Sizing Analysis

**Problem Space:** [Description]
**Geographic Region:** [Scope]
**Industry Segments:** [Relevant segments]
**Customer Profile:** [Who is affected]

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- **Description:** The total market demand for the problem space
- **Population Estimate:** [Number of potential users/organizations]
- **Market Size Estimate:** $[Annual revenue opportunity]
- **Methodology:** [Top-down from industry reports / Bottom-up from customer count]
- **Data Sources:** [List sources]

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
- **Segment of TAM:** [The portion you can realistically serve]
- **Filters Applied:** [Geography, segment, capability constraints]
- **Population Estimate:** [Number]
- **Market Size Estimate:** $[Amount]
- **SAM as % of TAM:** [Percentage]

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- **Realistically Capturable:** [What you can win in 1-3 years]
- **Competitive Position:** [Your share vs. alternatives]
- **Population Estimate:** [Number]
- **Market Size Estimate:** $[Amount]
- **SOM as % of SAM:** [Percentage]

### Assumptions & Risks
- [Key assumption about market size]
- [Key assumption about capture rate]
- [Risk that could shrink the market]
```

### Market Sizing Tips

- **Top-down:** Start from industry reports, narrow by filters. Good for ballpark estimates.
- **Bottom-up:** Count potential customers, multiply by expected revenue per customer. More credible for investors.
- **Triangulate:** Use both methods and reconcile. Significant gaps indicate wrong assumptions.
- SOM is typically 1-5% of SAM for startups, 10-20% for established companies in year 1.

## Reference Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `references/okr_framework.md` | OKR methodology, writing guidelines, alignment scoring |
| `references/strategy_types.md` | Detailed breakdown of all 5 strategy types with examples |
| `references/examples/sample_growth_okrs.json` | Complete sample output for growth strategy |

---

## Best Practices

### OKR Cascade

- Limit to 3-5 objectives per level
- Each objective should have 3-5 key results
- Key results must be measurable with current and target values
- Validate parent-child relationships before finalizing

### Alignment Scoring

- Target >80% overall alignment
- Investigate any score below 60%
- Balance scores ensure no team is overloaded
- Horizontal alignment prevents conflicting goals

### Team Configuration

- Configure teams to match your actual org structure
- Adjust contribution percentages based on team size
- Platform/Infrastructure teams often support all objectives
- Specialized teams (ML, Data) may only support relevant objectives

---

## Tool Reference

### okr_cascade_generator.py

Generates aligned OKRs from company strategy down to product and team levels with alignment scoring.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `strategy` | positional | growth | Strategy type: `growth`, `retention`, `revenue`, `innovation`, `operational` |
| `--teams`, `-t` | string | Growth,Platform,Mobile,Data | Comma-separated team names |
| `--contribution`, `-c` | float | 0.3 | Product contribution to company OKRs (0-1) |
| `--json`, `-j` | flag | False | Output as JSON instead of dashboard |
| `--metrics`, `-m` | string | sample metrics | Metrics as JSON string |

**Alignment scores generated:**
- Vertical alignment: How well each level supports the level above (target: >90%)
- Horizontal alignment: How well teams coordinate with each other (target: >75%)
- Coverage: What percentage of company OKRs are addressed by product (target: >80%)
- Balance: Whether work is evenly distributed across teams (target: >80%)
- Overall: Weighted composite score (target: >80%)

```bash
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py growth
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py retention --teams "Engineering,Design,Data,Growth"
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py revenue --contribution 0.4 --json
python scripts/okr_cascade_generator.py innovation --metrics '{"current": 50000, "target": 100000}'
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Overall alignment score <60% | Too many orphaned objectives without parent link | Reduce objective count; ensure every product OKR maps to a company OKR |
| Horizontal alignment low | Teams working on isolated goals | Identify shared objectives; add cross-team key results |
| Balance score low | One team overloaded with objectives | Redistribute objectives; adjust team contribution percentages |
| Key results not measurable | Template uses vague language | Replace every KR with specific current/target numbers and timeframe |
| Contribution percentage unrealistic | Product team cannot own 50%+ of company KR | Calibrate with other functions (sales, marketing); 25-35% is typical |
| Teams report OKR fatigue | Too many objectives per team | Limit to 3 objectives and 3-5 key results per team per quarter |
| OKRs disconnected from daily work | Sprint work not mapped to OKRs | Link every epic/story to a team-level key result |

---

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | How to Measure |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Overall alignment score | >80% | okr_cascade_generator alignment output |
| OKR completion rate | >70% of KRs hit target | End-of-quarter KR progress review |
| Cascade coverage | 100% of company OKRs have product children | Coverage score in alignment output |
| Planning velocity | <4 hours from strategy to team OKRs | Time from generator run to stakeholder approval |
| Quarterly check-in cadence | Bi-weekly progress reviews | Count of check-in meetings held |
| OKR quality | All KRs have current + target values | Audit key results for measurability |
| Team buy-in | >80% of teams confirm OKR relevance | Survey after OKR rollout |

---
