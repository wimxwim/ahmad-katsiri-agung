## Revenue Health Diagnostic

Before applying any framework, diagnose the current state.

### Revenue Health Decision Tree

```
START: "How healthy is our revenue engine?"
  |
  v
[Check NRR]
  |
  +-- NRR < 90% --> CRISIS. Existing customers are shrinking.
  |                  Stop scaling sales. Fix retention first.
  |
  +-- NRR 90-100% --> WARNING. Churn eating expansion.
  |                    Diagnose: product gap, CS gap, or ICP problem?
  |
  +-- NRR 100-110% --> HEALTHY. Base is stable. Focus on new logo + expansion.
  |
  +-- NRR > 110% --> STRONG. Expansion engine is working.
                      Check: is it sustainable or driven by price increases?
```

### Revenue Waterfall

```
Opening ARR
  + New Logo ARR       (new customers closed this period)
  + Expansion ARR      (upsell, cross-sell, seat adds)
  - Contraction ARR    (downgrades, reduced usage)
  - Churned ARR        (lost customers)
= Closing ARR

NRR = (Opening + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Opening x 100
GRR = (Opening - Contraction - Churn) / Opening x 100
```

## Revenue Metrics

### Board-Level Metrics (Monthly/Quarterly)

| Metric | Formula | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| ARR Growth YoY | (Current ARR / Prior Year ARR) - 1 | 2x+ early stage, 50%+ growth | Decelerating 2+ quarters |
| NRR | See waterfall above | > 110% | < 100% |
| GRR | See waterfall above | > 85% | < 80% |
| Pipeline Coverage | Open pipeline / Quota | > 3x | < 2x entering quarter |
| Magic Number | Net New ARR x 4 / Prior Q S&M Spend | > 0.75 | < 0.5 |
| CAC Payback | S&M Spend / New ARR x (1/GM%) | < 18 months | > 24 months |
| Quota Attainment | % of reps hitting quota | 60-70% | < 50% |
| Win Rate | Closed-won / (Closed-won + Closed-lost) | > 25% | < 15% |
| Average Sales Cycle | Days from opportunity to close | Stable or decreasing | Increasing 2+ quarters |

### NRR Benchmarks

| NRR Range | Signal | Strategic Implication |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| > 130% | World-class (Snowflake, Twilio) | Can grow even with zero new logos |
| 110-130% | Excellent | Strong expansion motion, invest in new logo |
| 100-110% | Healthy | Expansion offsets churn, monitor trends |
| 90-100% | Concerning | Churn exceeds expansion, fix before scaling |
| < 90% | Critical | Leaky bucket, all new revenue evaporates |

## Sales Model Selection

### Model Comparison Matrix

| Model | ACV Range | Sales Cycle | Team | Best For |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|
| Self-serve / PLG | $0-$10K | Minutes-days | No sales team | High volume, simple product |
| SMB inside sales | $5K-$50K | 2-6 weeks | SDR + AE | Mid-volume, moderate complexity |
| Mid-market | $25K-$150K | 4-12 weeks | SDR + AE + SE | Complex product, multiple stakeholders |
| Enterprise | $100K-$1M+ | 3-12 months | AE + SE + CSM + exec sponsor | Large organizations, high touch |
| Channel/Partner | Varies | Varies | Partner manager + enablement | Market coverage, geographic reach |

### Model Selection Decision Tree

```
START: "Which sales model?"
  |
  v
[What's the average deal size?]
  |
  +-- < $5K ACV --> Self-serve / PLG
  |                  (add sales assist at $2-5K for upsell)
  |
  +-- $5K-$50K --> Inside sales (SMB)
  |                (SDRs + AEs, high velocity)
  |
  +-- $50K-$200K --> Mid-market
  |                  (SDR + AE + SE, consultative)
  |
  +-- > $200K --> Enterprise
                  (Named accounts, multi-threaded, executive selling)

HYBRID: Most companies evolve to serve 2-3 segments.
Route by ACV and buying complexity.
```

## Pipeline Management

### Pipeline Stage Definitions

| Stage | Definition | Exit Criteria | Typical Conversion |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 0: Lead | Inbound inquiry or outbound target | Qualified as ICP fit | 20-30% to Stage 1 |
| 1: Discovery | First meeting completed | Pain confirmed, authority identified | 50-60% to Stage 2 |
| 2: Evaluation | Active evaluation, demo/POC | Champion identified, timeline set | 40-50% to Stage 3 |
| 3: Proposal | Proposal/pricing delivered | Budget confirmed, decision criteria clear | 50-60% to Stage 4 |
| 4: Negotiation | Terms being negotiated | Legal/procurement engaged | 70-80% to Close |
| 5: Closed-Won | Contract signed | Revenue recognized | -- |
| X: Closed-Lost | Deal lost | Loss reason documented | -- |

### Pipeline Coverage Model

| Quarter Position | Required Pipeline Coverage | Action If Below |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Q-1 (planning) | 4x quota | Increase top-of-funnel activity |
| Q start | 3x quota | Accelerate existing deals, add pipeline |
| Mid-quarter | 2x quota | Deal acceleration, executive engagement |
| Q-end | 1.5x quota | Forecast adjustment, pull-in deals |

### Deal Qualification: MEDDPICC

| Element | Question | Red Flag |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **M**etrics | What business outcome does the buyer measure? | No quantified value proposition |
| **E**conomic Buyer | Who signs the check? Have we met them? | Never met the decision-maker |
| **D**ecision Criteria | What criteria will they use to decide? | "We'll know it when we see it" |
| **D**ecision Process | What are the steps to get to a yes? | No defined process or timeline |
| **P**aper Process | What legal/procurement steps are required? | Unknown procurement process |
| **I**dentify Pain | What problem are they solving? Is it urgent? | Pain is theoretical, not acute |
| **C**hampion | Who internally advocates for us? | No internal champion identified |
| **C**ompetition | Who else are they evaluating? | "They said no competition" (always wrong) |

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Model Selection

| Model | Best When | Watch Out For |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Per-seat | Value scales with users | Seat consolidation games |
| Usage-based | Value directly tied to consumption | Revenue unpredictability |
| Tiered | Clear feature differentiation between segments | Tier boundaries feel arbitrary |
| Flat-rate | Simple product, uniform usage | Leaves money on table for heavy users |
| Value-based | Clear ROI measurement possible | Requires trust and proof |
| Hybrid | Complex product with multiple value dimensions | Complexity in quoting |

### Pricing Decision Framework

```
START: "How should we price?"
  |
  v
[What is the primary value driver for the customer?]
  |
  +-- Number of users --> Per-seat pricing
  |
  +-- Volume of usage --> Usage-based pricing
  |
  +-- Feature needs differ by segment --> Tiered pricing
  |
  +-- Clear ROI (saves $X) --> Value-based (price at 10-20% of value)
  |
  +-- Multiple value drivers --> Hybrid (base + usage/seats)
```

### Pricing Health Indicators

| Signal | Healthy | Unhealthy |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Price objection rate | < 20% of proposals | > 40% = value communication broken |
| Discount rate (avg) | < 15% off list | > 25% = pricing not anchored to value |
| Time since last increase | < 12 months | > 24 months = inflation eating margin |
| Price increase churn | < 2% incremental churn | > 5% = increase was too aggressive |
| Win rate after increase | Stable or improved | Dropped > 10 points = over-corrected |

---

## Sales Team Scaling

### Capacity Model

```
Required AEs = Target New ARR / (Quota x Attainment Rate x Ramp Factor)

Example:
  Target: $5M new ARR
  Quota per AE: $1M
  Attainment: 65%
  Ramp factor: 0.85 (accounts for ramp time)

  Required AEs = $5M / ($1M x 0.65 x 0.85) = 9.1 --> Hire 10 AEs
```

### Sales Team Structure by ARR

| ARR | Team Structure | Key Hires |
|-----|---------------|-----------|
| $0-$1M | Founder-led sales | No sales team yet |
| $1-$3M | 1-2 AEs | First AE, maybe first SDR |
| $3-$10M | 3-6 AEs, 2-4 SDRs, 1 sales manager | First sales manager, first SE |
| $10-$25M | VP Sales, 2 teams, SDR team, SE team | VP Sales, Rev Ops, CS Manager |
| $25-$50M | CRO, multiple segments, CS org | CRO, segment leaders, enablement |
| $50M+ | Full revenue org | SVPs, regional leaders, strategy |

### Quota Setting Guidelines

| Metric | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Quota : OTE ratio | 4-6x (e.g., $800K quota for $160K OTE) |
| Ramp period | 3-6 months depending on sales cycle |
| Ramp quota | 25% (M1-2), 50% (M3-4), 75% (M5-6), 100% (M7+) |
| Quota coverage target | Hire for 120-130% of plan (accounts for attrition + ramp) |
| % of team hitting quota | Target 60-70%. < 50% = quota too high. > 80% = too low. |

---

## Red Flags

- NRR declining 2 quarters in a row -- customer value proposition is broken
- Pipeline coverage < 3x entering quarter -- forecasting a miss
- Win rate dropping while sales cycle extends -- competitive pressure or ICP drift
- < 50% of AEs quota-attaining -- comp plan, ramp, or quota calibration issue
- Average deal size declining -- moving downmarket under pressure
- Magic Number < 0.5 -- sales spend not converting to revenue
- Forecast accuracy < 80% -- pipeline quality or rep sandbagging
- Single customer > 15% of ARR -- concentration risk
- "Too expensive" in > 40% of loss notes -- value demonstration broken, not price
- Expansion ARR < 20% of total new ARR -- upsell motion missing
- No win/loss analysis process -- learning nothing from every deal outcome
- Sales and CS not aligned on health scoring -- churn surprises

## Integration with C-Suite

| When... | CRO Works With... | To... |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Pricing changes | CPO + CFO | Align value positioning, model margin impact |
| Product roadmap | CPO (`cpo-advisor`) | Ensure features support ICP and close pipeline |
| Headcount plan | CFO + CHRO | Capacity model with ROI justification |
| NRR declining | CPO + COO | Root cause: product gap or CS process failure |
| Enterprise expansion | CEO (`ceo-advisor`) | Executive sponsorship for key accounts |
| Revenue targets | CFO (`cfo-advisor`) | Bottom-up model to validate top-down targets |
| Pipeline SLA | CMO (`cmo-advisor`) | MQL-to-SQL conversion, CAC by channel |
| Security reviews | CISO (`ciso-advisor`) | Unblock enterprise deals with security artifacts |
| Sales ops | COO (`coo-advisor`) | RevOps staffing, commission infrastructure |
| Sales hiring | CHRO (`chro-advisor`) | Comp plans, ramp modeling, territory design |
| Competitive wins/losses | Competitive Intel (`competitive-intel`) | Battlecard updates, positioning |

---

## Proactive Triggers

- NRR < 100% -- retention must be fixed before scaling acquisition
- Pipeline coverage < 3x -- forecast at risk, flag to CEO immediately
- Win rate declining 2+ quarters -- sales process or product alignment issue
- Top customer > 20% of ARR -- concentration risk, diversify immediately
- No pricing review in 12+ months -- likely leaving revenue on the table
- Expansion revenue < 15% of new ARR -- missing upsell/cross-sell opportunity
- Sales cycle lengthening -- competitive or product issue, investigate
- > 30% discount rate on deals -- pricing or value communication problem

---

| `--json` | optional | Output in JSON format instead of human-readable text |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| NRR declining 2+ quarters | Product-market fit erosion, CS gap, or ICP drift | Segment NRR by cohort and plan tier; diagnose whether churn is product, service, or fit-driven |
| Pipeline coverage below 3x entering quarter | Insufficient top-of-funnel or poor lead-to-opp conversion | Audit lead sources by conversion rate; increase SDR activity; align with CMO on MQL volume |
| Win rate dropping while sales cycle extends | Competitive pressure, product gap, or wrong ICP | Analyze win/loss by competitor and segment; review qualification criteria; check ICP alignment |
| Less than 50% of AEs quota-attaining | Quota calibration, ramp, or enablement issue | Benchmark quota:OTE ratio (4-6x); review ramp schedule; assess territory balance |
| Magic Number below 0.5 | S&M spend not converting to revenue efficiently | Review channel ROI; reduce spend on low-performing channels; improve rep productivity before adding headcount |
| Forecast accuracy below 80% | Pipeline quality issues, sandbagging, or weak inspection | Standardize stage exit criteria; implement MEDDPICC qualification; conduct weekly deal reviews |
| Expansion ARR less than 20% of total new ARR | Missing upsell/cross-sell motion or no expansion playbook | Design expansion triggers with CS; implement usage-based upsell alerts; create cross-sell bundles |

---

## Success Criteria

- NRR exceeds 110% sustained across 4 consecutive quarters
- Pipeline coverage maintains 3-4x quota with healthy stage distribution at quarter start
- Win rate stable or improving against top 3 competitors
- 60-70% of ramped AEs achieving quota attainment
- Magic Number exceeds 0.75 indicating efficient S&M spend
- CAC Payback under 18 months with LTV:CAC ratio above 3:1
- Forecast accuracy exceeds 85% within two quarters of implementation

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In scope:** Revenue health diagnostics (NRR, GRR, ARR waterfall), sales model selection and optimization, pipeline management (stage definitions, coverage modeling, MEDDPICC qualification), pricing strategy frameworks, sales team scaling (capacity model, quota setting, territory design), revenue forecasting, and board-level revenue reporting.

**Out of scope:** CRM system administration or data extraction (tools consume JSON exports), individual deal coaching (tools flag patterns, not prescribe tactics), marketing attribution modeling (use cmo-advisor), customer success health scoring (use customer-success-manager), and compensation plan legal compliance. Tools analyze point-in-time revenue snapshots; continuous monitoring requires CRM/BI integration.

**Limitations:** Revenue benchmarks based on aggregate B2B SaaS data; targets vary by stage, ACV, and sales motion (PLG vs enterprise vs channel). Pipeline analysis assumes accurate CRM data including stage, value, age, and close date. Sales efficiency metrics require accurate financial data that early-stage companies may not track. Quota recommendations are directional; final calibration requires territory-level analysis.

---

## Integration Points

- **cfo-advisor** -- Revenue forecasts and capacity models feed financial planning; pricing impacts margin modeling
- **cpo-advisor** -- Product roadmap must support ICP needs and close pipeline gaps; feature requests filtered through CPO
- **cmo-advisor** -- Pipeline SLA and MQL-to-SQL conversion jointly owned; CAC optimization requires marketing alignment
- **coo-advisor** -- RevOps staffing and commission infrastructure depend on operational capacity planning
- **competitive-intel** -- Win/loss data and competitive win rates inform battlecard updates and positioning
- **sales-success/** -- Sales efficiency metrics cascade to account executive and sales ops execution
