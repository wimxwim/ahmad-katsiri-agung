## Clarify First

Before triaging the NDA, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Counterparty relationship** — a direct competitor or a Fortune-500 vendor changes routing and scrutiny even when the text scores GREEN
- [ ] **Mutual vs one-way** — GREEN fast-track requires a mutual NDA; a one-way NDA where you are the recipient warrants closer review
- [ ] **Your role (discloser or recipient)** — determines whether missing carveouts and broad definitions actually hurt you, and how to route the result

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the output.

## Tools

### NDA Screener

Scans NDA text for red flags and outputs GREEN/YELLOW/RED classification with reasoning.

```bash
# Screen an NDA file
python scripts/nda_screener.py nda_draft.txt

# JSON output for integration
python scripts/nda_screener.py incoming_nda.md --json

# Save screening results
python scripts/nda_screener.py nda_draft.txt --output screening.json --json
```

**What it detects:**
- Missing standard carveouts (public knowledge, prior possession, independent development, third-party receipt, legal compulsion)
- Non-solicitation and non-compete clauses
- Perpetual confidentiality obligations
- Overbroad definition of confidential information
- Residuals clauses granting usage rights to ideas/concepts
- IP assignment or license grants
- Liquidated damages provisions
- Unlimited audit rights
- One-sided obligations

**Classification Rules:**

| Level | Criteria | Routing |
|-------|----------|---------|
| GREEN | All 5 carveouts present, no problematic provisions, standard structure | Business approver; no counsel needed |
| YELLOW | 1-2 missing carveouts, minor problematic provisions, or non-standard terms | Legal counsel review within 48 hours |
| RED | 3+ missing carveouts, non-compete/non-solicitation, IP assignment, perpetual term with no exit | Senior counsel review; do not sign |

### NDA Checklist

Generates a compliance checklist for an NDA, checking all 10 screening criteria with pass/fail status.

```bash
# Generate checklist for an NDA
python scripts/nda_checklist.py nda_draft.txt

# JSON output
python scripts/nda_checklist.py nda_draft.txt --json

# Save checklist
python scripts/nda_checklist.py nda_draft.txt --output checklist.json --json
```

**10-Point Screening Criteria:**

| # | Criterion | What It Checks |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Agreement Structure | Mutual vs. one-way; parties identified; purpose stated |
| 2 | Definition of Confidential Info | Scope, specificity, marking requirements |
| 3 | Obligations | Standard of care, use restrictions, disclosure limits |
| 4 | Standard Carveouts | 5 required: public knowledge, prior possession, independent development, third-party receipt, legal compulsion |
| 5 | Permitted Disclosures | Representatives, advisors, affiliates with need-to-know |
| 6 | Term & Duration | Reasonable term, survival period, obligations after expiry |
| 7 | Return/Destruction | Obligation to return or destroy upon request/termination |
| 8 | Remedies | Injunctive relief, damages, indemnification scope |
| 9 | Problematic Provisions | Non-solicitation, non-compete, exclusivity, residuals, IP assignment, audit rights |
| 10 | Governing Law | Jurisdiction, dispute resolution mechanism |

## Reference Guides

### NDA Screening Criteria
`references/nda_screening_criteria.md`

Complete evaluation reference covering:
- All 10 screening criteria with detailed sub-items
- GREEN/YELLOW/RED classification rules with specific examples
- Common NDA issues with standard positions
- Redline approaches for common problems

---

## Workflows

### Standard NDA Triage

1. **Receive NDA** -- Save as `.txt` or `.md` file
2. **Screen** -- Run `nda_screener.py` for quick RED/YELLOW/GREEN classification
3. **Checklist** -- Run `nda_checklist.py` for detailed 10-point evaluation
4. **Route** -- Follow routing recommendations based on classification
5. **Track** -- Log screening result and routing decision

### Bulk NDA Processing

```bash
# Screen multiple NDAs
for nda in ndas/*.txt; do
  echo "=== $nda ==="
  python scripts/nda_screener.py "$nda"
  echo ""
done

# Generate JSON report for all NDAs
for nda in ndas/*.txt; do
  python scripts/nda_screener.py "$nda" --json --output "results/$(basename $nda .txt).json"
done
```

## Routing Recommendations

| Classification | Approver | Timeline | Escalation |
|---------------|----------|----------|------------|
| GREEN | Business owner or designated approver | Same day; sign within 24 hours | None required |
| YELLOW | Legal counsel review | 48-hour turnaround | Escalate to senior counsel if no response in 72 hours |
| RED | Senior legal counsel | 5 business day turnaround | Escalate to General Counsel if deal-critical |

### GREEN Fast-Track Conditions

All of the following must be true for GREEN classification:
- Mutual NDA (both parties bound)
- All 5 standard carveouts present
- No non-solicitation, non-compete, or exclusivity clauses
- No IP assignment or license grants
- No residuals clause
- Term is 2-5 years (not perpetual)
- Return/destruction obligation present
- Standard remedies (injunctive relief, no liquidated damages)

### RED Escalation Triggers

Any one of the following triggers RED classification:
- Non-compete clause of any scope
- Non-solicitation clause covering employees or customers
- IP assignment or broad license grant
- Missing 3 or more standard carveouts
- Perpetual obligations with no termination right
- Liquidated damages for breach
- Exclusivity provision

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Screener classifies everything as YELLOW | NDA uses non-standard formatting that breaks pattern matching | Ensure NDA is clean plain text; remove PDF artifacts and headers/footers |
| Missing carveouts false positive | Carveouts are present but use unusual language | Review the full "Exceptions" or "Exclusions" section manually; the screener checks common phrasings |
| Non-compete not detected | Non-compete is embedded in definitions or obligations section rather than standalone | Search the full document for "compete", "competitive", "restrict" manually |
| Checklist shows PASS but screener shows RED | Checklist evaluates presence; screener evaluates content quality | Use both tools together; the screener's RED overrides checklist PASS |
| Script errors on large files | NDA text exceeds expected size (>100KB) | Ensure the file contains only the NDA text, not appendices or exhibits |

---

## Success Criteria

- **NDA triage under 5 minutes:** Automated screening replaces 30-minute manual review.
- **Zero missed RED-severity issues:** Every non-compete, IP assignment, and missing carveout is flagged.
- **GREEN NDAs signed within 24 hours:** Fast-track routing eliminates bottleneck for standard agreements.
- **YELLOW NDAs resolved within 48 hours:** Counsel review turnaround meets SLA.
- **Consistent classification across reviewers:** 10-point checklist eliminates subjective "looks fine" approvals.
- **100% of NDAs screened before routing:** No NDA reaches an approver without automated triage.

---

## Scope & Limitations

**Covers:**
- Pattern-based screening of NDA text for structural issues and problematic provisions
- 10-point compliance checklist against standard NDA requirements
- GREEN/YELLOW/RED classification with routing recommendations
- Detection of non-solicitation, non-compete, IP assignment, residuals, and other problematic clauses
- Missing carveout identification

**Does NOT cover:**
- **Legal advice** -- classification is a screening aid, not a legal opinion
- **Negotiation or redlining** -- use `nda-review` for deep clause analysis and redline generation
- **Multi-party NDAs** -- optimized for bilateral (two-party) agreements
- **Industry-specific NDA requirements** (healthcare, defense, government) -- patterns target commercial NDAs
- **Non-English NDAs** -- pattern matching is English-language only

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Signing GREEN-classified NDAs without any human review | Automated screening cannot catch business-context risks (e.g., NDA with a direct competitor) | GREEN classification means low legal risk, not zero risk; business approver must still review |
| Using triage as a substitute for deep NDA review on complex deals | Triage checks structure and red flags, not clause quality or negotiation position | Run `nda-review` skill for M&A, joint venture, or high-value partnership NDAs |
| Ignoring YELLOW classifications because "it's just an NDA" | YELLOW items like missing carveouts or residuals clauses create real legal exposure | Route all YELLOW NDAs to counsel; missing independent development carveout alone can cost millions |
| Treating all NDAs as equal regardless of counterparty relationship | NDA with a startup partner requires different scrutiny than NDA with a Fortune 500 vendor | Adjust review depth based on counterparty, deal value, and information sensitivity |
