# Productboard Expert

Master-level expertise in Productboard workspace configuration, Insight inbox triage, Driver-based prioritization, Feature hierarchy management, Releases and Roadmap views, REST API operations, and two-way integration with Jira, Linear, Azure DevOps, Salesforce, Intercom, and Slack. Productboard sits between customer-feedback intake (Slack/Intercom/Salesforce/email) and the engineering tracker (Jira/Linear), with an opinionated three-layer model that differs meaningfully from generic issue trackers.

## Overview

Productboard separates three layers: **Insights** (inbound customer evidence), **Features** (candidate product changes organized in Components and parent/child hierarchy), and **Drivers + Releases** (the prioritization framework — Drivers = weighted criteria, Releases = time-boxed delivery groupings). Insights link to Features (many-to-many); Features score against Drivers; high-scoring Features get added to Releases; Releases push down to Jira/Linear epics. The flow is **inbox → triage → prioritize → ship**.

The job of a Productboard expert is to operate fluently inside this model: configure the workspace cleanly, run the Insight inbox without backlog, design Driver weightings that match company strategy, and write API automations for what the UI does not cover.

## Core Capabilities

- **Workspace & hierarchy setup** — Components, Feature taxonomy, Tags, custom fields, roles
- **Insight inbox triage** — the highest-leverage daily ritual; verbatim discipline, multi-Feature linking
- **Driver configuration & Feature scoring** — 3-5 weighted Drivers, composite scoring, quarterly re-weighting
- **Releases & Roadmap views** — time-boxed delivery, audience-specific views, Portal for customers
- **REST API automation** — bulk Insight/Feature operations, webhooks, custom-field updates, pagination
- **Two-way integration** — Jira/Linear/Azure DevOps (Features↔Epics) and Salesforce/HubSpot/Intercom/Zendesk (Insight capture)

## When to Use

- Setting up a new Productboard workspace, Component hierarchy, or Feature taxonomy
- Configuring Drivers and weighting them against strategic objectives
- Running the Insight inbox triage workflow (the highest-leverage daily ritual)
- Configuring two-way Jira/Linear/Azure DevOps integration or CRM customer sync
- Building Roadmap views for executives, customers, and internal teams
- Writing API calls to bulk-create Insights, update Features, or read prioritization data
- Migrating from spreadsheet-based prioritization, or troubleshooting "Insights aren't flowing", "scores aren't updating", and similar workflow failures

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:** Workspace and Component hierarchy setup, Insight inbox triage, Driver configuration and Feature scoring, Releases and Roadmap views (internal and customer-facing), Productboard REST API operations (Features, Insights, Releases, custom fields, webhooks), two-way integration setup with Jira/Linear/Azure DevOps, customer-data sync from Salesforce/HubSpot, bulk operations via API, Portal configuration.

**Out of Scope:** Engineering-side Jira/Linear configuration (see `jira-expert/`, `linear-expert/`). Strategic prioritization framework selection (see `execution/prioritization-frameworks/`). PRD authoring (see `execution/create-prd/`). Customer interview synthesis (see `discovery/interview-synthesis/`).

**Limitations:** API rate limits are workspace-wide; aggressive scripts can starve the UI. The Salesforce/HubSpot integration is one-way (CRM → Productboard) on a schedule, not real time. Drivers max out at 10 per workspace on most plans. Roadmap views are good for time-bound delivery (Releases) but weaker for outcome-based roadmaps (Now/Next/Later) — augment with `execution/outcome-roadmap/`. Per-Component access control is an Enterprise feature.

## Integration Points

| Integration | Direction | What flows |
|---|---|---|
| `jira-expert/` | Productboard ↔ Jira | Features push as Epics; status flows back; Sprint plan derived from prioritization |
| `linear-expert/` | Productboard ↔ Linear | Features push as Projects/Issues; Cycle assignment from Release dates |
| `execution/prioritization-frameworks/` | Bidirectional | Drivers operationalize RICE/ICE/WSJF; external scores import as custom fields |
| `execution/create-prd/` | Productboard → PRD | High-priority Features become PRDs; PRD link returns as custom field |
| `execution/outcome-roadmap/` | Bidirectional | Outcome themes map to Objectives; Releases give the delivery side |
| `execution/roadmap-communication/` | Productboard → Comms | Customer-facing Roadmap variants pull from Portal |
| `execution/customer-feedback-triage/` | Bidirectional | Triaged feedback clusters become Insights; inbox is the triage entry point |
| `execution/release-notes/` | Productboard → Release Notes | Completed Features in a Release become release-note line items |
| `senior-pm/` | Productboard → Portfolio | Driver scores and Feature distribution feed portfolio health |
| `notion-pm/` | Productboard ↔ Notion | Roadmap embeds into Notion; deep PRDs live in Notion linked from Features |
| `discovery/interview-synthesis/` | Bidirectional | Interview insights become Notes; high-evidence Features motivate interviews |
| `business-growth/customer-success/` | CS → Productboard | CS is a primary Insight source via Salesforce / Intercom integration |
