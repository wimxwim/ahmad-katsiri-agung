# Legal Meeting Briefing Skill

## Overview

Production-ready toolkit for preparing structured briefings for meetings with legal relevance and tracking resulting action items. Supports 8 meeting types with type-specific preparation guidance, a 13-section briefing template, and action item management with priority levels and follow-up cadence. Designed for legal teams preparing counsel, in-house attorneys, and legal operations professionals for productive meetings.

## Clarify First

Before generating the briefing, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Meeting type** — deal-review, board, regulatory, litigation, etc. — selects which type-specific sections appear (e.g. privilege considerations only for regulatory/litigation)
- [ ] **Participants with orgs and roles** — populate the counterparty-dynamics and interests sections; without them the brief is generic
- [ ] **Objective / agenda** — sets the depth and which sections matter; drives the preparation-gap list
- [ ] **Privilege sensitivity** — for regulatory/government or litigation meetings, determines what goes in the privilege section vs what can be shared

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the briefing.

## Tools

### 1. Meeting Brief Generator (`scripts/meeting_brief_generator.py`)

Generate a meeting briefing skeleton pre-populated with sections based on meeting type.

```bash
python scripts/meeting_brief_generator.py \
  --type deal-review \
  --title "Series B Term Sheet Review" \
  --date 2026-04-15 \
  --participants '[{"name":"Jane Smith","org":"Legal","role":"Lead Counsel"}]'

python scripts/meeting_brief_generator.py \
  --type board \
  --title "Q1 Board Meeting" \
  --date 2026-04-20 \
  --agenda "Legal update,Risk report,Pending approvals" --json

python scripts/meeting_brief_generator.py \
  --type regulatory \
  --title "FDA Pre-Submission Meeting" \
  --date 2026-05-01 \
  --participants '[{"name":"Dr. Lee","org":"FDA","role":"Reviewer"}]'
```

### 2. Action Item Tracker (`scripts/action_item_tracker.py`)

Manage action items from legal meetings with priority levels, ownership, and status tracking.

```bash
python scripts/action_item_tracker.py add \
  --title "Draft NDA for Vendor X" \
  --owner "Jane Smith" \
  --priority high \
  --deadline 2026-04-20 \
  --meeting "Series B Review"

python scripts/action_item_tracker.py list \
  --filter-status open \
  --filter-priority high

python scripts/action_item_tracker.py complete --id 3

python scripts/action_item_tracker.py dashboard --json

python scripts/action_item_tracker.py update --id 5 \
  --status in-progress --notes "Waiting for counterparty response"
```

## Reference Guides

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `references/meeting_type_guides.md` | Preparation guidance for all 8 meeting types |
| `references/briefing_templates.md` | Complete 13-section briefing template and action item tracking |

## Workflows

### 5-Step Briefing Methodology

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. Identify Meeting | Determine meeting type, participants, objectives | Meeting classification |
| 2. Assess Preparation Needs | Select type-specific sections and depth | Section checklist |
| 3. Gather Context | Collect documents, prior notes, open issues | Background materials |
| 4. Synthesize into Briefing | Run generator; populate sections with gathered context | Draft briefing |
| 5. Identify Preparation Gaps | Review for missing info; flag items needing follow-up | Gap list |

### Meeting Type Selection

| Meeting Type | Key Indicator |
|-------------|---------------|
| Deal Review | Transaction under consideration or in progress |
| Board/Committee | Board of directors, audit committee, compensation committee |
| Vendor Call | Meeting with supplier, contractor, or service provider |
| Team Sync | Internal legal team meeting |
| Client/Customer | External client or customer-facing meeting |
| Regulatory/Government | Meeting with regulator, agency, or government body |
| Litigation/Dispute | Meeting about active or potential legal dispute |
| Cross-Functional | Meeting with stakeholders from multiple departments |

### Action Item Workflow

1. **Capture** -- Record action items during or immediately after meeting
2. **Assign** -- Set owner, priority, and deadline for each item
3. **Track** -- Monitor progress via dashboard; update status as work progresses
4. **Follow-Up** -- Follow cadence based on priority level
5. **Close** -- Mark complete when done; archive for audit trail

### Follow-Up Cadence

| Priority | Follow-Up Frequency | Escalation |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| High | Daily check-in | Escalate after 2 missed days |
| Medium | Weekly check-in | Escalate after 1 missed week |
| Low | Monthly check-in | Escalate after 1 missed month |
| Overdue | Immediate escalation | Notify supervisor and meeting owner |

## Meeting Types

### Deal Review

Focus: Transaction analysis, contract review, approval requirements.

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Deal Summary | Parties, structure, value, timeline |
| Contract Status | Draft version, open issues, redline items |
| Approval Requirements | Who must approve; delegated authority limits |
| Counterparty Dynamics | Negotiation position, prior dealings, leverage |
| Comparable Deals | Similar transactions for benchmarking terms |

### Board/Committee

Focus: Legal department update, risk highlights, governance.

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Legal Department Update | Headcount, budget, key accomplishments |
| Risk Highlights | Top legal risks with likelihood and impact |
| Regulatory Update | Recent regulatory changes affecting the organization |
| Pending Approvals | Items requiring board or committee action |
| Litigation Summary | Active matters, reserves, settlement status |

### Regulatory/Government

Focus: Compliance posture, enforcement patterns, privilege considerations.

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Regulatory Body Context | Agency structure, jurisdiction, enforcement priorities |
| Enforcement Patterns | Recent enforcement actions in the sector |
| Matter History | Prior interactions, submissions, correspondence |
| Privilege Considerations | What is privileged; what can be shared |
| Compliance Posture | Current compliance status; remediation progress |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Brief missing type-specific sections | Wrong meeting type selected | Review meeting type descriptions; select the most specific type |
| Participants not formatted | JSON format error | Use valid JSON array: `'[{"name":"X","org":"Y","role":"Z"}]'` |
| Action items not persisting | Tracker uses file-based storage | Ensure write permissions in working directory; check `action_items.json` |
| Dashboard shows stale data | Cached data from previous run | Re-run dashboard command; items are loaded fresh from storage |
| Overdue items not flagged | Clock/timezone mismatch | Verify system date; deadlines use YYYY-MM-DD format |
| Agenda items not populating | Comma-separated format expected | Use `--agenda "Item 1,Item 2,Item 3"` format |
| Brief too generic | Minimal parameters provided | Add participants, agenda, and type-specific context |
| Action item ID not found | Item was completed or deleted | Run `list --filter-status all` to see all items including completed |

## Success Criteria

- **Preparation Coverage**: Every legal meeting has a briefing covering all relevant sections for its type
- **Action Item Capture**: 100% of action items captured with owner, deadline, and priority within 24 hours
- **On-Time Completion**: 90%+ of action items completed by deadline
- **Meeting Effectiveness**: Participants report improved preparation and productivity (measured by survey)
- **Follow-Up Compliance**: High-priority items followed up daily; medium weekly; low monthly

## Scope & Limitations

**This skill covers:**
- Meeting briefing generation with type-specific sections for 8 meeting types
- Action item tracking with CRUD operations, filtering, and status dashboard
- Follow-up cadence management based on priority levels
- Preparation gap identification for pre-meeting readiness

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Calendar integration or meeting scheduling
- Real-time meeting notes or transcription
- Email drafting or distribution of briefings
- Document management or version control for meeting materials
- Video conferencing or collaboration tool integration

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Generic briefing for all meeting types | Misses type-specific concerns; wastes prep time on irrelevant sections | Select correct meeting type; use type-specific guidance |
| Capturing action items days after meeting | Details forgotten; ownership unclear; deadlines slip | Capture during meeting or within 2 hours; use tracker immediately |
| Single owner for all items | Creates bottleneck; no accountability for individual tasks | Assign specific owner per item; each item has exactly one owner |
| No follow-up on action items | Items go stale; commitments missed; trust erodes | Follow cadence: high=daily, medium=weekly, low=monthly |
| Skipping privilege considerations for regulatory meetings | Inadvertent privilege waiver; disclosed protected communications | Always complete privilege section for regulatory/government meetings |
