# Notion for Product Management

Master-level expertise in using Notion as the documentation and operational backbone for a product team: PRDs, OKRs, roadmaps, decision logs, sprint reviews, 1:1 notes, customer research, and sync patterns with Jira, Linear, and GitHub. Covers Notion's database model, view design, formula and rollup patterns, page architecture, and REST API.

## Overview

Notion's PM value comes from its database model: every meaningful PM artifact (a PRD, an OKR, a roadmap row, a decision) becomes a row in a typed database, with relations to other databases. This unlocks linked views (one source of truth, many surface presentations), rollups (aggregate child progress into a parent), and a queryable API. The job of a Notion PM expert is to design these databases up front, restrain ad-hoc page creation, and tie the workspace into Jira/Linear/GitHub so the artifacts stay current without manual maintenance.

## Core Capabilities

- **Database design** — typed schemas for PRDs, OKRs, Roadmap, Decisions, and Sprint/Cycle Reviews, with the right property types (relation, rollup, formula, status, unique_id).
- **View design** — Table, Board, Timeline, Calendar, Gallery, and List views with filters, sorts, and groups tuned per artifact.
- **Page & workspace architecture** — Teamspace setup, curated home dashboards, linking strategy (relations vs mentions vs sub-pages), governance and review cadence.
- **REST API authoring** — query/create/update/append calls, compound filters, pagination, and rate-limit handling.
- **Sync patterns** — one-way, two-way, roll-up, and embed integrations with Jira, Linear, and GitHub.

## When to Use

- Standing up a new product team's documentation workspace
- Designing a PRD, OKR, Roadmap, or Decisions database from scratch
- Refactoring an existing Notion workspace that has grown into a sprawl of unrelated pages
- Building roadmap or status views aggregated from underlying issue trackers
- Authoring Notion REST API calls (page creation, database queries, block updates)
- Setting up two-way sync between Notion and Jira/Linear/GitHub
- Establishing governance: ownership, review cadence, archive strategy

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:** Notion workspace and Teamspace setup, database design for PRDs/OKRs/Roadmap/Decisions/Reviews/1:1s, view design, property and relation modeling, page architecture, Notion REST API authoring, sync pattern design with Jira/Linear/GitHub, governance and review cadences.

**Out of Scope:** Notion administration (SCIM, SAML, billing) at the workspace level beyond Teamspace setup. Jira space and project configuration (hand off to `jira-expert/` and `confluence-expert/`). Linear configuration (hand off to `linear-expert/`). Strategic OKR setting (hand off to `execution/brainstorm-okrs/`). Story splitting and backlog refinement (hand off to `execution/backlog-refinement/`, `execution/story-splitting/`).

**Limitations:** Notion's API rate limits (~3 req/s) make it unsuitable for very high-throughput sync; batch and queue. Status properties cannot have options created via the API in lower plan tiers; pre-create options manually. Rollups cannot reference rollups in older API versions; chain via formulas where needed. Page-level permissions can be overridden in unexpected ways by Teamspace-level changes. Notion is not a real-time collaboration substitute for chat; do not try to replace Slack with comments.

## Integration Points

| Integration | Direction | What Flows |
|---|---|---|
| `jira-expert/` | Notion ↔ Jira | PRD-to-Epic creation; Jira issue embeds in PRD pages |
| `confluence-expert/` | Migration | When moving from Confluence to Notion, structure and content mapping |
| `linear-expert/` | Notion ↔ Linear | PRD-to-Project creation; Linear progress rollups into Notion |
| `execution/create-prd/` | PRD → Notion | PRD scaffolder output rendered as Notion blocks via `--format notion` |
| `execution/brainstorm-okrs/` | OKR → Notion | OKR validator output written to the OKR DB |
| `execution/outcome-roadmap/` | Roadmap → Notion | Roadmap rows materialized in the Roadmap DB |
| `execution/daci-framework/` | Decision → Notion | DACI decisions logged in the Decisions DB |
| `execution/status-update-generator/` | Notion → Status | Weekly status pulls aggregates from PRDs/OKRs DBs |
| `execution/release-notes/` | Notion → Release | Shipped PRDs feed release notes input |
| `senior-pm/` | Notion → Portfolio | OKR and Roadmap DBs feed portfolio reports |
| `discovery/interview-synthesis/` | Research → Notion | Customer research database populated from interview synth output |
