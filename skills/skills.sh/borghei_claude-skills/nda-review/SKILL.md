## Clarify First

Before reviewing the NDA, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Your perspective: Recipient or Discloser** — flips every risk rating and the direction of each redline (the core `--perspective` input)
- [ ] **Deal context** — M&A, employment, VC/fundraising, or standard commercial — triggers the variation callouts (standstill, invention assignment, portfolio conflicts)
- [ ] **What you cannot accept** — non-compete, IP grant, perpetual term — sets which of the 7 immediate red flags force escalation vs negotiation

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the issue log.

## Tools

### NDA Clause Reviewer

Performs deep analysis of NDA text, extracting and classifying each clause against best practices. Detects overbroad definitions, missing carveouts, problematic residuals, IP grants, indemnification, and audit rights.

```bash
# Review from recipient perspective (default)
python scripts/nda_clause_reviewer.py nda_draft.txt

# Review from discloser perspective
python scripts/nda_clause_reviewer.py nda_draft.txt --perspective discloser

# JSON output for integration
python scripts/nda_clause_reviewer.py nda_draft.txt --json

# Save issue log
python scripts/nda_clause_reviewer.py nda_draft.txt --output issues.json --json
```

**What it produces:**
- Clause-by-clause issue log with H/M/L risk ratings
- Preferred redline for each issue
- Fallback position if preferred is rejected
- Rationale for each recommendation
- Owner assignment (legal, business, executive)
- Deadline category (pre-signing, 30-day, 90-day)

---

## Reference Guides

### NDA Clause Reference
`references/nda_clause_reference.md`

Five deep reference modules:
- Duration & Scope (term, survival, scope limitations)
- Key Clauses (definition, purpose, permitted use, marking)
- Party Obligations (standard of care, use restriction, disclosure limits)
- Remedies & Liability (injunctive relief, damages, indemnification)
- Standard Exceptions (public knowledge, prior possession, independent development, third-party receipt, legal compulsion)

### NDA Review Templates
`references/nda_review_templates.md`

Output templates and worked examples:
- Executive Summary format
- Clause-by-clause Issue Log table format
- Ownership and timing defaults by topic category
- Worked examples for social media endorsement and group licensing scenarios

## Workflows

### Full NDA Review

1. **Triage first** -- Run `nda-triage` skill for quick GREEN/YELLOW/RED classification
2. **Deep review** -- Run `nda_clause_reviewer.py` with appropriate `--perspective`
3. **Review issue log** -- Address HIGH-risk items first, then MEDIUM, then LOW
4. **Prepare redlines** -- Use preferred positions; prepare fallbacks
5. **Assign owners** -- Legal owns clause language; business owns commercial terms
6. **Set deadlines** -- Pre-signing items before next meeting; post-signing items within 30-90 days
7. **Negotiate** -- Present redlines; use fallbacks as needed
8. **Final review** -- Verify all issues resolved before execution

### Perspective-Based Review

| Perspective | Focus Areas | Key Concerns |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Recipient | Scope of obligations, carveouts, residuals, return/destruction | Protecting freedom to operate; avoiding contamination claims |
| Discloser | Definition breadth, remedies, duration, permitted disclosures | Maximizing protection; ensuring adequate enforcement |

---

## Immediate Red Flags

Stop review and escalate if any of these 7 red flags are present.

| # | Red Flag | Why It Matters | Escalation |
|---|----------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Non-compete clause | Restricts business operations; requires separate consideration and analysis | Senior counsel immediately |
| 2 | IP assignment or license grant | Transfers rights beyond confidentiality scope | Senior counsel immediately |
| 3 | Non-solicitation of employees or customers | Employment law implications; may be unenforceable | Senior counsel within 24 hours |
| 4 | Missing 3+ standard carveouts | Fundamentally deficient NDA | Counsel review before any response |
| 5 | Liquidated damages or penalty clause | Transforms NDA into penalty contract | Senior counsel within 24 hours |
| 6 | Perpetual obligations with no termination | Indefinite legal burden with no exit | Counsel review within 48 hours |
| 7 | Exclusivity provision | Limits engagement with other parties | Business leadership + counsel |

---

## Review Checklists

### Recipient Checklist (8 Topics)

| # | Topic | Key Questions | Risk if Missing |
|---|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Definition Scope | Is confidential info bounded? Is there a marking requirement? | Overbroad definition traps all shared information |
| 2 | Standard Carveouts | Are all 5 carveouts present and properly drafted? | Missing carveouts restrict legitimate business activities |
| 3 | Permitted Use | Is use restricted to stated purpose? Can we share with advisors? | Overly restrictive use limits may impede evaluation |
| 4 | Residuals | Is there a residuals clause? Is it narrow or broad? | Broad residuals clause benefits; narrow or absent protects discloser |
| 5 | Return/Destruction | Return or destroy option? Retention exception for backups? | No retention exception is impractical for electronic data |
| 6 | Term & Survival | Reasonable term? Reasonable survival period? Termination right? | Perpetual obligations are burdensome |
| 7 | Remedies | Injunctive relief only? Or liquidated damages/indemnification? | Excessive remedies shift risk disproportionately |
| 8 | Problematic Provisions | Non-compete? Non-solicitation? IP assignment? Audit rights? | These provisions have no place in a standard NDA |

### Discloser Checklist (5 Topics)

| # | Topic | Key Questions | Risk if Missing |
|---|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Definition Breadth | Does definition cover all information we will share? All forms? | Gaps in definition leave information unprotected |
| 2 | Obligation Strength | Standard of care adequate? Written agreements from recipients? | Weak obligations increase risk of unauthorized disclosure |
| 3 | Remedies | Injunctive relief available? Is it meaningful in this jurisdiction? | Without adequate remedies, NDA is unenforceable in practice |
| 4 | Duration | Is the term long enough? Does survival cover our exposure window? | Short terms may expire before information loses value |
| 5 | Recipient Limits | Who can receive? Is need-to-know enforced? Downstream binding? | Unrestricted sharing exposes information to unauthorized parties |

## Variation Callouts

Different NDA contexts require different review emphasis.

### M&A Context

| Additional Concern | Reason | Recommended Position |
|-------------------|--------|---------------------|
| Standstill provision | Prevents hostile acquisition moves during due diligence | Accept if mutual and time-limited (12-18 months) |
| Non-solicitation of employees | Standard in M&A NDAs | Accept if limited to key employees for 12 months |
| Broader definition | M&A requires extensive information sharing | Accept broader definition with strong carveouts |
| Longer survival | Sensitive strategic information shared | 3-5 year survival is appropriate |
| Residuals clause sensitivity | Competitive intelligence at stake | Resist residuals clause or narrow significantly |

### Employment Context

| Additional Concern | Reason | Recommended Position |
|-------------------|--------|---------------------|
| Invention assignment | Employer IP ownership | Separate from NDA; use invention assignment agreement |
| Post-employment obligations | Obligations after employment ends | Limit survival to 2 years; ensure enforceability |
| Scope of work product | What the employee creates | Define in employment agreement, not NDA |
| Non-compete enforceability | Varies by jurisdiction | Review local law before including; may be void |

### VC / Fundraising Context

| Additional Concern | Reason | Recommended Position |
|-------------------|--------|---------------------|
| Investor portfolio conflicts | VC may have portfolio companies in same space | Include portfolio company exclusion or conflict provision |
| Residuals clause | VCs see many similar pitches | Resist; protect trade secrets and specific data |
| Term limitations | VCs want short obligations | 2-3 year term acceptable; ensure adequate survival |
| Definition scope | Founders want maximum protection | Balance with investor need for portfolio flexibility |

## Risk Rating Guide

| Rating | Criteria | Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| HIGH (H) | Could result in material legal or financial exposure; deal-breaker potential | Must resolve before signing | Pre-signing |
| MEDIUM (M) | Creates meaningful risk but manageable; strong preference to resolve | Should resolve; accept with documented risk if necessary | Within 30 days |
| LOW (L) | Minor preference; improves agreement but not material | Nice to resolve; concede if needed for higher-priority wins | Within 90 days |

### Risk Rating by Issue Type

| Issue Type | Typical Rating | Escalation |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Missing carveout (any) | M-H | Counsel |
| Overbroad definition | M | Counsel |
| Non-compete/non-solicitation | H | Senior counsel |
| IP assignment | H | Senior counsel |
| Residuals clause (broad) | M | Counsel |
| Perpetual obligations | M-H | Counsel |
| No return/destruction | M | Counsel |
| Liquidated damages | H | Senior counsel |
| Missing governing law | L-M | Counsel |
| One-sided obligations | M | Counsel |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Reviewing without knowing your perspective | Recipient and discloser have opposing interests on many clauses | Always set `--perspective` flag; review with clear role in mind |
| Treating the NDA as "just a formality" | Missing problematic provisions that create real obligations | Run full clause review on every NDA, regardless of perceived importance |
| Negotiating clause-by-clause in document order | Wastes time on early low-priority clauses; may not reach critical issues | Prioritize by risk rating; address H items first |
| Accepting "standard" NDAs without review | Every organization's "standard" is different; one party's standard favors that party | No NDA is truly standard; always review |
| Ignoring context (M&A, employment, VC) | Standard NDA review misses context-specific risks | Use variation callouts for specialized contexts |
| Not preparing fallback positions | Stuck when counterparty rejects preferred redline | Prepare preferred + fallback for every H and M item |
| Signing before resolving H-rated issues | Creates material legal exposure | Require all H items resolved or executive sign-off |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| All issues rated LOW | NDA is genuinely well-drafted, or text extraction lost key sections | Manually verify critical sections (definition, carveouts, remedies) are in the input file |
| Perspective flag has no effect | Tool adjusts weighting, not detection; same issues found either way | Perspective changes risk ratings and recommendations, not issue detection |
| Too many issues generated | NDA is non-standard or poorly drafted | Focus on H-rated issues first; use the issue log as a negotiation roadmap |
| Script misses embedded provisions | Non-compete or IP clause hidden in definitions or general provisions | Search full document for "compete", "assign", "license", "solicit" manually |
| Output format does not match template | Tool outputs structured data, not final deliverable | Use `references/nda_review_templates.md` to format the output for stakeholders |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Complete clause-by-clause review in under 15 minutes:** Automated analysis replaces 1-2 hours of manual review.
- **Zero missed HIGH-risk issues:** Every non-compete, IP assignment, and missing carveout is identified.
- **Actionable redlines for every H and M issue:** Each issue has preferred position, fallback, and rationale.
- **Clear ownership assignment:** Every issue has a designated owner (legal, business, executive).
- **Perspective-appropriate recommendations:** Recipient and discloser reviews produce different risk weightings.
- **Context-aware review:** M&A, employment, and VC variations are flagged when relevant.

---

## Scope & Limitations

**Covers:**
- Deep clause-by-clause NDA analysis with pattern matching and risk classification
- Perspective-based review (Recipient vs. Discloser)
- Issue log generation with redlines, fallbacks, rationale, owners, and deadlines
- Detection of 7 immediate red flags for triage
- Context variation awareness (M&A, Employment, VC)

**Does NOT cover:**
- **Legal advice** -- this tool supports review, it does not replace qualified legal counsel
- **Rapid triage** -- use `nda-triage` for quick GREEN/YELLOW/RED screening
- **Contract types beyond NDAs** -- use `contract-review` for general commercial agreements
- **Jurisdiction-specific enforceability analysis** -- requires local counsel assessment
- **Non-English NDAs** -- pattern matching is English-language only

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Running deep review without triage first | Wastes time on detailed analysis of NDAs that should be rejected outright (RED triage) | Always run `nda-triage` first; only proceed to deep review for YELLOW or GREEN-with-complexity |
| Using Recipient perspective for both sides | Recipient perspective minimizes obligations and maximizes carveouts, which is wrong if you are the discloser | Always set the correct `--perspective` flag based on your role |
| Accepting all LOW-rated issues without review | Some LOW issues are low-risk individually but create cumulative exposure when combined | Review the full issue log for interaction effects; multiple LOW issues in the same area may compound to MEDIUM |
| Skipping the variation callouts for specialized contexts | Standard NDA review misses M&A standstill provisions, employment invention assignment, VC portfolio conflicts | Check the variation callouts section for your specific deal context |
