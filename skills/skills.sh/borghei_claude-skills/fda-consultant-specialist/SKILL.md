## Clarify First

Before selecting a pathway or assessing compliance, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Device class and predicate** — Class I/II/III and whether a predicate device exists (drives 510(k) vs De Novo vs PMA)
- [ ] **Intended use / indications** — what the device claims and its use environment (sets the substantial-equivalence argument and clinical-evidence needs)
- [ ] **Software/AI nature** — SaMD, adaptive AI needing a PCCP, or connected device (cybersecurity/SBOM) (changes the required documentation set)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the analysis.

## FDA Pathway Selection

Determine the appropriate FDA regulatory pathway based on device classification and predicate availability.

### Decision Framework

```
Predicate device exists?
├── YES → Substantially equivalent?
│   ├── YES → 510(k) Pathway
│   │   ├── No design changes → Abbreviated 510(k)
│   │   ├── Manufacturing only → Special 510(k)
│   │   └── Design/performance → Traditional 510(k)
│   └── NO → PMA or De Novo
└── NO → Novel device?
    ├── Low-to-moderate risk → De Novo
    └── High risk (Class III) → PMA
```

### Pathway Comparison

| Pathway | When to Use | Timeline | Cost |
|---------|-------------|----------|------|
| 510(k) Traditional | Predicate exists, design changes | 90 days | $21,760 |
| 510(k) Special | Manufacturing changes only | 30 days | $21,760 |
| 510(k) Abbreviated | Guidance/standard conformance | 30 days | $21,760 |
| De Novo | Novel, low-moderate risk | 150 days | $134,676 |
| PMA | Class III, no predicate | 180+ days | $425,000+ |

### Pre-Submission Strategy

1. Identify product code and classification
2. Search 510(k) database for predicates
3. Assess substantial equivalence feasibility
4. Prepare Q-Sub questions for FDA
5. Schedule Pre-Sub meeting if needed

**Reference:** See [fda_submission_guide.md](references/fda_submission_guide.md) for pathway decision matrices and submission requirements.

## FDA QMSR — Quality Management System Regulation

### Transition from QSR (21 CFR 820) to QMSR

The FDA finalized the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR) in January 2024, replacing the legacy Quality System Regulation (QSR) with ISO 13485:2016 alignment. The rule became effective **February 2, 2026**.

| Aspect | Legacy QSR (21 CFR 820) | QMSR (Effective Feb 2026) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Framework | FDA-specific prescriptive requirements | Incorporates ISO 13485:2016 by reference |
| Design controls | 820.30 (FDA-specific) | ISO 13485 Clause 7.3 |
| CAPA | 820.100 | ISO 13485 Clause 8.5 |
| Document control | 820.40 | ISO 13485 Clause 4.2 |
| Management responsibility | 820.20 | ISO 13485 Clause 5 |
| Purchasing controls | 820.50 | ISO 13485 Clause 7.4 |

**Key differences under QMSR:**
- ISO 13485:2016 is incorporated by reference as the primary QMS standard
- FDA retains certain device-specific requirements not covered by ISO 13485 (e.g., complaint handling per 21 CFR 820.198)
- Organizations already ISO 13485 certified have a significant head start
- No separate FDA registration for QMS — single system serves both ISO and FDA

### QMSR Transition Checklist

- [ ] Gap analysis: ISO 13485:2016 vs. current QSR compliance
- [ ] Update Quality Manual to reference ISO 13485 clause structure
- [ ] Map existing SOPs to ISO 13485 clauses
- [ ] Address FDA-specific retained requirements (complaint handling, MDR reporting)
- [ ] Train staff on ISO 13485 terminology and structure
- [ ] Update supplier agreements to reference new regulatory framework
- [ ] Conduct internal audit against QMSR requirements
- [ ] Update design history files to ISO 13485 Clause 7.3 format

## FDA Regulatory Updates & Cross-Framework Integration

### FDA QMSR — Quality Management System Regulation

The FDA is aligning 21 CFR Part 820 with ISO 13485:2016 through the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR), effective February 2, 2026:

- **Key Change:** QSR (21 CFR 820) replaced by ISO 13485 as the recognized quality system standard
- **Impact:** Manufacturers must comply with ISO 13485:2016 instead of QSR-specific requirements
- **Design Controls:** ISO 13485 Clause 7.3 replaces 820.30
- **CAPA:** ISO 13485 Clause 8.5 replaces 820.90/820.100
- **Transition:** FDA accepting both QSR and QMSR during transition period

### AI/ML-Based Software as Medical Device (SaMD)

- **Predetermined Change Control Plan (PCCP):** Required for AI/ML devices that learn and adapt
- **Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP):** FDA's 10 guiding principles for AI/ML in medical devices
- **Transparency:** Clear labeling of AI/ML-based functionality and limitations
- **Real-World Performance:** Post-market monitoring of AI model performance drift
- **Cross-reference:** See `eu-ai-act-specialist` for EU AI Act requirements for AI medical devices

### Enhanced Cybersecurity Requirements (PATCH Act)

- **Premarket Submissions:** Cybersecurity documentation required for all connected devices
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Mandatory for all premarket submissions
- **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure:** Required policy for all connected device manufacturers
- **Postmarket Patches:** Cybersecurity patches exempt from 510(k) requirements
- **Cross-reference:** See `infrastructure-compliance-auditor` for technical cybersecurity checks

### Cross-Framework Mapping (FDA ↔ MDR ↔ ISO 13485)

| Area | FDA (QSR/QMSR) | EU MDR 2017/745 | ISO 13485:2016 |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| 510(k) submission returned as RTA (Refuse to Accept) | Missing user fee, incomplete Form 3514, no predicate identified, or inadequate SE comparison | Review the RTA checklist per FDA guidance; verify payment, complete all eSTAR fields, confirm K-number in FDA database, and address all technological characteristics in SE comparison |
| QSR compliance checker shows gaps in design controls (820.30) | Design History File incomplete or not aligned with ISO 13485 Clause 7.3 under QMSR | Map existing DHF to ISO 13485 Clause 7.3 structure; ensure design inputs, outputs, reviews, verification, and validation are documented with traceability |
| HIPAA risk assessment returns low score for technical safeguards | Missing encryption at rest/transit, no MFA implementation, or audit logging not enabled | Implement AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit, MFA for all users with ePHI access, and comprehensive audit logging; run `hipaa_risk_assessment.py` with `--category technical` to validate |
| FDA AI request (Additional Information) received during 510(k) review | Performance testing insufficient, SE argument incomplete, or software documentation gaps | Respond within 180 days; address each question specifically; supplement with additional test data, clinical evidence, or software documentation per IEC 62304 |
| QMSR transition gap analysis reveals significant differences | Organization structured QMS around legacy 21 CFR 820 rather than ISO 13485 | Conduct systematic gap analysis mapping 820 subsections to ISO 13485 clauses; prioritize complaint handling (retained FDA requirement), risk-based evidence across all processes, and updated Quality Manual |
| Cybersecurity documentation rejected in premarket submission | SBOM incomplete, threat model missing, or coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy not published | Generate comprehensive SBOM in CycloneDX or SPDX format; complete STRIDE threat model per AAMI TIR57; publish CVD policy; document patch management lifecycle plan |
| AI/ML SaMD submission lacks Predetermined Change Control Plan | Adaptive algorithm deployed without PCCP framework | Develop PCCP covering modification types, validation protocol, impact assessment, performance monitoring, and user notification plan; include all four change categories with appropriate verification levels |

---

## Success Criteria

- **510(k) submission accepted on first attempt** -- zero RTA deficiencies, with all eSTAR sections complete, user fee verified, predicate identified, and SE comparison addressing all technological characteristics
- **QSR/QMSR compliance score above 85%** -- as measured by `qsr_compliance_checker.py`, with all critical subsections (design controls, CAPA, document control) showing evidence of implementation
- **HIPAA technical safeguards fully implemented** -- AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit, MFA enforced, audit controls active, and automatic logoff configured for all systems handling ePHI
- **FDA submission timeline targets met** -- 510(k) traditional within 90 days, De Novo within 150 days, PMA within 180 days, tracked via `fda_submission_tracker.py` milestones
- **QMSR transition completed** -- Quality Manual references ISO 13485 clause structure, all SOPs mapped, FDA-specific retained requirements addressed, and internal audit conducted against QMSR requirements
- **Cybersecurity documentation complete for all connected devices** -- SBOM, threat model, security testing reports, vulnerability disclosure policy, and patch management plan included in premarket submissions

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- FDA regulatory pathway selection (510(k), De Novo, PMA) with decision framework and comparison
- 510(k) submission process including eSTAR requirements, SE comparison, and RTA prevention
- Quality System Regulation (21 CFR 820) and QMSR (ISO 13485:2016 alignment) compliance assessment
- HIPAA Security Rule safeguard evaluation for medical device software
- Device cybersecurity requirements including SBOM, threat modeling, and PATCH Act compliance
- AI/ML SaMD framework including PCCP, GMLP principles, and training data characterization
- Cross-framework mapping between FDA, EU MDR, and ISO 13485

**Out of Scope:**
- Preparation or writing of actual FDA submission documents -- this skill provides frameworks and gap analysis, not document authoring
- Clinical trial design, execution, or statistical analysis for PMA clinical data
- FDA establishment registration, device listing, or UDI system implementation
- Post-market surveillance reporting (MDR, MedWatch) beyond process guidance
- De novo classification request scientific review preparation
- Direct interaction with FDA reviewers or Pre-Submission (Q-Sub) meeting facilitation

**Important Notes:**
- The QMSR became effective February 2, 2026 -- all manufacturers must now comply with ISO 13485:2016 as incorporated by reference, with FDA-specific retained requirements
- The Quality System Inspection Technique (QSIT) has been withdrawn and replaced with updated inspection procedures under Compliance Program 7382.850
- Risk-based thinking is now expected across all QMS processes under QMSR, not just design controls
