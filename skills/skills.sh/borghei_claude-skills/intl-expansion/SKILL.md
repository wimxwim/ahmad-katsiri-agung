# International Expansion

Frameworks for expanding into new markets: selection, entry mode, localization, regulatory compliance, GTM adaptation, and execution. Every expansion is a bet -- this skill structures the bet to maximize signal before committing resources.

## Keywords

international expansion, market entry, localization, go-to-market, GTM, regional strategy, international markets, market selection, cross-border, global expansion, EMEA, APAC, LATAM, data residency, local entity, regional hiring, currency, payment methods, regulatory compliance

## Clarify First

Before generating, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Which deliverable is needed** (market scoring, entry-mode recommendation, localization plan, regulatory map, pricing, or launch plan) — each follows a different framework
- [ ] **The target market(s) under consideration** — regional regulatory, cultural-distance, and pricing guidance is country-specific
- [ ] **Existing traction in that market** (inbound demand, current ARR from it) — the entry-mode graduation path is gated on revenue thresholds; pull vs. push changes the go/no-go
- [ ] **Product type and home-market model** (B2B SaaS vs. other; PLG vs. sales-led) — the frameworks are tuned for B2B SaaS and the GTM adaptation depends on the current model

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Decision Sequence

```
Market Selection --> Entry Mode --> Regulatory Assessment --> Localization Plan
  --> GTM Strategy --> Team Structure --> Launch --> Scale or Exit
```

---

## Market Selection Framework

### Scoring Matrix

| Factor | Weight | Assessment Method | Score 1-5 |
|--------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Market size (addressable) | 25% | TAM in target segment, willingness to pay, growth rate |
| Competitive intensity | 20% | Incumbent strength, number of alternatives, market gaps |
| Regulatory complexity | 20% | Barriers to entry, compliance cost, timeline to launch |
| Cultural distance | 15% | Language, business practices, buying behavior, sales cycle |
| Existing traction | 10% | Inbound demand, existing customers, partnership signals |
| Operational complexity | 10% | Time zones, infrastructure, payment systems, talent pool |

### Market Selection Decision Tree

```
START: Considering a new market
  |
  v
[Is there existing pull from this market?]
  |
  +-- YES (inbound demand, existing customers) --> Strong signal. Score and proceed.
  |
  +-- NO  --> [Is there a strategic reason to enter?]
              |
              +-- YES (competitor pressure, investor expectation) --> Score carefully.
              |    Be honest about push vs. pull.
              |
              +-- NO  --> Do not enter. Focus on existing markets.
```

### Regional Quick Reference

## Entry Mode Evaluation

### Entry Mode Comparison

| Mode | Investment | Control | Risk | Speed | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------|------|-------|----------|
| Remote sales (export) | Low ($10-50K) | Low | Low | Fast | Testing demand before committing |
| Partnership/reseller | Medium ($50-200K) | Medium | Medium | Medium | Markets with strong local requirements |
| Local hire (no entity) | Medium ($100-300K) | Medium-High | Medium | Medium | First boots on the ground |
| Full entity (subsidiary) | High ($200K-1M) | Full | High | Slow | Major markets with proven demand |
| Acquisition | Highest ($500K+) | Full | Highest | Fast (if done well) | Immediate market presence + customer base |

### Entry Mode Decision Tree

```
START: Market selected, entry mode needed
  |
  v
[Do you have existing customers in this market?]
  |
  +-- NO  --> Start with Remote Sales
  |            Test demand for 3-6 months
  |            If revenue > $200K ARR from market --> Upgrade
  |
  +-- YES --> [Revenue from this market > $500K ARR?]
              |
              +-- NO  --> Remote Sales or Local Hire (EOR)
              |
              +-- YES --> [Does the market require local entity?]
                          |
                          +-- YES (regulatory requirement) --> Full Entity
                          +-- NO  --> [Revenue trajectory?]
                                      |
                                      +-- Growing fast --> Local Hire, plan Entity
                                      +-- Stable --> Partnership or Local Hire
```

### Default Graduation Path

```
Stage 1: Remote Sales ($0-200K ARR from market)
  - Sell remotely from HQ
  - No local presence
  - Test messaging, pricing, ICP fit

Stage 2: Local Hire ($200K-500K ARR)
  - 1-2 people via EOR (Employer of Record)
  - Sales + CS representative
  - No legal entity yet

Stage 3: Local Entity ($500K-2M ARR)
  - Establish legal entity
  - Hire local team (3-8 people)
  - Local banking, contracts, compliance

Stage 4: Regional Hub ($2M+ ARR)
  - Full local team (10+ people)
  - Regional leadership
  - Market-specific product features
```

## Localization Framework

### Product Localization

| Layer | Must Have | Nice to Have | Cost Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Language (UI) | Full translation of core product | Marketing site in local language | $20-50K initial |
| Currency | Display and charge in local currency | Multi-currency invoicing | $10-30K engineering |
| Payment methods | Credit card + local preferred method | All local payment methods | $5-20K per method |
| Data formats | Date, time, number, address | Local units (km, kg, etc.) | $5-15K engineering |
| Data residency | If legally required | If customer-required | $50-200K infrastructure |
| Cultural adaptation | Avoid cultural missteps | Full cultural optimization | Variable |

### GTM Localization

| Element | Approach | Common Mistake |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Messaging | Adapt value proposition for local pain points | Copy-paste from home market |
| Channel strategy | Research local channels (may differ significantly) | Assume same channels work everywhere |
| Case studies | Local customer references essential | Only showing US/UK case studies |
| Partnerships | Local integrations and ecosystem | Ignoring local tech ecosystem |
| Events | Regional conferences and meetups | Only attending global events |
| Content/SEO | Local language content, local domain | English-only content for non-English market |

### Operations Localization

| Area | Key Considerations |
|------|-------------------|
| Legal entity | Type, timeline, cost, ongoing compliance |
| Tax compliance | VAT/GST registration, transfer pricing, withholding |
| Employment law | At-will vs. strong protections, notice periods, benefits |
| Customer support | Hours, language, channels |
| Banking | Local bank account, payment processing |
| Insurance | Local requirements for entity and employees |

---

## Regulatory Compliance by Region

### Data Privacy Requirements

| Regulation | Region | Key Requirements | Penalty |
|-----------|--------|------------------|---------|
| GDPR | EU/EEA | Consent, data minimization, DPO, breach notification | Up to 4% annual revenue |
| UK GDPR | UK | Similar to GDPR, separate registration | Up to 4% annual revenue |
| LGPD | Brazil | Similar to GDPR, DPO required | Up to 2% revenue (capped R$50M) |
| PIPL | China | Data localization, consent, cross-border assessment | Up to 5% annual revenue |
| PIPA | South Korea | Consent, purpose limitation, data localization for some | Up to 3% of related revenue |
| APPI | Japan | Consent, purpose specification, cross-border transfer rules | Criminal penalties possible |
| Privacy Act | Australia | APPs, breach notification, cross-border transfer rules | Increasing penalties |

### Data Residency Decision Tree

```
START: Expanding to new region
  |
  v
[Does local law require data residency?]
  |
  +-- YES (e.g., certain China, Russia, some industry regs)
  |     --> Local hosting mandatory. Budget for local infrastructure.
  |
  +-- NO  --> [Do target customers require local data hosting?]
              |
              +-- YES (common in enterprise, government, healthcare)
              |     --> Offer regional hosting as option. Major sales enabler.
              |
              +-- NO  --> Global hosting acceptable. Document your data practices.
```

## International GTM Strategy

### Pricing Strategy by Market

| Approach | When | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Global uniform pricing | Simple product, global ICP | Same price everywhere |
| PPP-adjusted | Consumer product, price-sensitive markets | Lower prices in developing markets |
| Market-specific | Different value perception by market | Higher in markets with less competition |
| Local currency, global rate | B2B SaaS, enterprise | Price in local currency, USD-equivalent |

### Sales Model Adaptation

| Market Characteristic | Sales Model Adjustment |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| High-trust culture (Nordics, Japan) | Longer relationship building, more proof points |
| Price-sensitive market (India, LATAM) | Flexible pricing, usage-based options |
| Channel-dominant (Japan, Middle East) | Partner-led sales, local reseller required |
| Enterprise-heavy (DACH, France) | On-premises option, compliance documentation |
| PLG-friendly (US, UK, Nordics) | Self-serve with local payment methods |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Prevention |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Entering too many markets at once | FOMO, board pressure | Maximum 1-2 new markets per year |
| Copy-paste GTM from home market | Assuming buyers are the same | Research local buying behavior first |
| Underestimating regulatory cost | "We'll figure it out" | Regulatory assessment BEFORE committing |
| Hiring local team too early | Optimism about demand | Prove $200K+ ARR from market first |
| Wrong pricing (just converting) | Laziness or assumption | Research local willingness to pay |
| Ignoring local competition | Focused on global competitors | Local players often dominate segments |
| Underestimating cultural distance | "Business is business everywhere" | Invest in local market expertise |
| No exit criteria | Sunk cost fallacy | Define revenue milestone to hit within 12 months |

---

## Launch Checklist

### Pre-Launch (T-90 days to T-30 days)

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Legal | Entity established (if needed) | [ ] |
| Legal | Local contracts reviewed by local counsel | [ ] |
| Compliance | Data privacy requirements met | [ ] |
| Compliance | Tax registration completed | [ ] |
| Product | Core product localized (language, currency) | [ ] |
| Product | Local payment methods integrated | [ ] |
| Sales | ICP defined for local market | [ ] |
| Sales | Pricing set for local market | [ ] |
| Marketing | Local messaging and positioning | [ ] |
| Marketing | Local case studies (or adjacent) | [ ] |
| People | First local hire identified | [ ] |
| Support | Support coverage plan for timezone | [ ] |

### Launch (T-0 to T+90 days)

| Week | Focus | Success Metric |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1-4 | Activate local presence, first outreach | 20+ qualified conversations |
| 5-8 | First pipeline built, first deals | 5+ opportunities in pipeline |
| 9-12 | First customers closed, iterate | 2+ closed deals, product feedback |

### Exit Criteria

If these are not met within 12 months, evaluate exit:

| Metric | Minimum Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|
| Pipeline generated | $500K+ |
| Revenue closed | $200K+ ARR |
| Customer satisfaction | NPS > 20 in market |
| Cost of entry | < 3x first-year revenue |

---

## Red Flags

- Entering a market because a board member suggested it (without data)
- No local market research before committing resources
- Pricing set by currency conversion, not local value research
- Hiring a country manager before proving demand
- Legal entity established before $200K ARR from market
- Ignoring local data privacy requirements
- Same marketing messaging as home market
- No exit criteria defined before entry

---

## Integration with C-Suite

| Role | Contribution to Expansion |
|------|--------------------------|
| CEO (`ceo-advisor`) | Market selection decision, strategic commitment |
| CFO (`cfo-advisor`) | Investment sizing, ROI modeling, entity structure, tax |
| CRO (`cro-advisor`) | Revenue targets, sales model adaptation, pricing |
| CMO (`cmo-advisor`) | Positioning, channel strategy, local brand |
| CPO (`cpo-advisor`) | Localization roadmap, feature priorities |
| CTO (`cto-advisor`) | Infrastructure, data residency, scaling |
| CHRO (`chro-advisor`) | Local hiring, employment law, compensation |
| CISO (`ciso-advisor`) | Data privacy, regulatory compliance |
| COO (`coo-advisor`) | Operations setup, process adaptation |

---

## Output Artifacts

| Request | Deliverable |
|---------|-------------|
| "Should we expand to [market]?" | Market scoring analysis with recommendation |
| "How should we enter [market]?" | Entry mode recommendation with graduation path |
| "Localization plan for [market]" | Product + GTM + operations localization checklist |
| "Regulatory requirements for [region]" | Compliance checklist with timeline and cost |
| "International pricing strategy" | Market-specific pricing recommendation |
| "Launch plan for [market]" | 90-day launch plan with milestones and exit criteria |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Market scores high but pipeline generation is near zero | Market sizing based on TAM not SAM; ICP not validated locally | Re-score using serviceable addressable market; run 20 discovery calls before committing further resources |
| Local hire producing no results after 3 months | Wrong profile (too senior or too junior), insufficient HQ support, or wrong ICP | Assess whether hire has local market expertise AND startup mindset; ensure HQ provides enablement materials and responsive support |
| Regulatory compliance taking 2x longer than planned | Underestimated complexity; no local legal counsel engaged early | Engage local legal counsel in pre-launch phase (T-90); add 50% buffer to all regulatory timelines |
| Localization costs spiraling beyond budget | Scope creep from "nice to have" to "must have"; no phased approach | Apply localization framework layers strictly: Must Have first, Nice to Have only after revenue proves market |
| Pricing not competitive in new market | Direct currency conversion without local willingness-to-pay research | Conduct 10+ pricing conversations with local prospects; consider PPP adjustment or market-specific pricing tier |
| Partnership/reseller underperforming | Partner not incentivized properly or wrong partner profile | Review partner selection criteria; ensure economic alignment (margins); set 90-day performance review with exit clause |
| Cultural missteps damaging brand in new market | No local market expertise on team; copy-paste approach from home market | Hire local advisor or consultant for cultural review; adapt messaging, not just translate it |

---

## Success Criteria

- Market selection scoring produces a clear rank-ordered list with at least 3 candidate markets scored across all 6 factors
- Entry mode selected matches the graduation path: no legal entity before $200K ARR from market
- Pre-launch checklist 100% complete by T-30 days before launch
- First 90 days produce 20+ qualified conversations, 5+ pipeline opportunities, and 2+ closed deals
- Exit criteria defined before market entry with specific revenue and cost thresholds
- Localization phased: Must Have items complete at launch; Nice to Have items gated behind revenue milestone
- Regulatory compliance achieved before first customer contract signed in new market

---

## Scope & Limitations

- **In scope:** Market selection scoring, entry mode evaluation, localization planning (product, GTM, operations), regulatory compliance mapping by region, pricing strategy adaptation, launch planning with exit criteria, team structure decisions
- **Out of scope:** Detailed tax advisory (engage local tax counsel); immigration and visa processing (use specialized provider); transfer pricing implementation (use CFO Advisor with tax expertise); detailed legal entity formation (use local legal counsel)
- **Limitation:** Regional quick reference data is indicative and changes with regulations; always validate with local experts before committing
- **Limitation:** Framework optimized for B2B SaaS companies; B2C, hardware, and marketplace businesses have different expansion dynamics
- **Limitation:** Market scoring is a structured estimate, not a guarantee; validate with real market signals (inbound demand, pilot customers) before major investment
