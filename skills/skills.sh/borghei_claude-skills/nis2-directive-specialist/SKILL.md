## NIS2 Overview

The **NIS2 Directive (EU 2022/2555)** is the EU's updated framework for cybersecurity, replacing the original NIS Directive (EU 2016/1148). It entered into force on January 16, 2023, with Member States required to transpose it into national law by **October 17, 2024**.

**Key objectives:**

- Establish a high common level of cybersecurity across the EU
- Harmonize cybersecurity requirements and enforcement
- Expand scope to cover more sectors and entities
- Strengthen incident reporting obligations
- Introduce management accountability for cybersecurity
- Enhance supply chain security requirements

**Legal basis:** Article 114 TFEU (internal market harmonization)

**Relationship to other frameworks:**

| Framework | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| ISO 27001 | NIS2 measures map closely to ISO 27001 controls |
| GDPR | NIS2 complements GDPR for security of processing |
| CER Directive | Critical Entities Resilience — physical security complement |

## Clarify First

Before running the assessment, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Entity scope** — sector (Annex I vs Annex II), size thresholds, and any automatic-inclusion criteria (determines Essential vs Important classification and the obligation set)
- [ ] **Task** — scope determination, 10-measure compliance check, or supply-chain assessment (selects the tool and workflow)
- [ ] **Member State** — which national transposition applies (the tools assess the directive baseline, not country-specific law)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the assessment.

## Compliance Assessment Workflow

### Phase 1: Scope Determination

```
1. Identify sector and sub-sector classification
   → Use NIS2 Scope Analyzer tool
2. Determine entity size (employees, turnover, balance sheet)
3. Check for automatic inclusion criteria
4. Classify as Essential or Important entity
5. Identify applicable Member State transposition requirements
```

### Phase 2: Gap Assessment

```
1. Document current security posture
2. Map existing controls to NIS2 10 minimum measures
   → Use NIS2 Compliance Checker tool
3. Assess incident reporting readiness
4. Evaluate supply chain security maturity
5. Review management accountability compliance
6. Generate gap analysis report
```

### Phase 3: Remediation Planning

```
1. Prioritize gaps by risk and regulatory impact
2. Develop remediation roadmap (see Implementation Playbook)
3. Allocate budget and resources
4. Define project milestones and ownership
5. Establish governance structure
```

### Phase 4: Implementation

```
1. Implement technical controls
2. Develop and approve policies
3. Deploy monitoring and detection capabilities
4. Establish incident reporting procedures
5. Conduct supply chain security assessments
6. Train management body and staff
```

### Phase 5: Continuous Compliance

```
1. Regular compliance assessments (quarterly minimum)
2. Annual management body training refresh
3. Incident response exercises (biannual)
4. Supply chain security reviews (annual)
5. Policy review and update cycles
6. Audit preparation and execution
```

| 9–10 | **Supply Chain** | Supplier assessments, contractual updates, third-party risk program |
| 11 | **Testing** | Incident response exercises, penetration testing, compliance validation |
| 12 | **Operationalize** | Final audit, continuous monitoring, ongoing compliance program launch |

### Quick Wins (Month 1–3)

1. Enable MFA for all remote access and privileged accounts
2. Document existing security policies
3. Establish incident reporting contact with national CSIRT
4. Begin management body cybersecurity training
5. Create asset inventory of critical systems
6. Review and update backup procedures

### Resource Estimates

| Organization Size | FTE Requirement | Estimated Budget |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Medium (50–249) | 1–2 dedicated + project team | €200K–€500K |
| Large (250–999) | 2–4 dedicated + project team | €500K–€1.5M |
| Enterprise (1000+) | 4–8 dedicated + project team | €1.5M–€5M+ |

---

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Scope Analyzer returns "out of scope" for an entity that should be in scope | Automatic inclusion criteria not triggered; size thresholds not met | Check for automatic inclusion flags (DNS providers, TLD registries, sole provider). Verify `--turnover` and `--employees` values. Use `--checklist` flag to review all criteria. |
| Compliance Checker scores are unexpectedly low | Assessment JSON has missing or null control responses | Run `--template` to regenerate a fresh assessment template. Ensure every control question has a boolean or score value. |
| Gap report does not cover all 10 measures | `--measures` flag is filtering output | Remove the `--measures` flag to assess all 10 Article 21 measures. Verify the config JSON includes all measure sections. |
| Entity classified as "Important" instead of "Essential" | Sector falls under Annex II rather than Annex I | Review sector/sub-sector classification. Annex I sectors produce Essential entities; Annex II sectors produce Important entities. Size also matters. |
| National transposition requirements unclear | Member State has not yet fully transposed NIS2 | As of early 2026, 13 of 27 EU Member States have incomplete transposition. Check the ECSO NIS2 Transposition Tracker for country-specific status. Apply the directive's baseline requirements. |
| Supply chain assessment section incomplete | Supplier tier classification not provided in config | Populate supplier data with tier levels (Critical/Important/Standard) and include contractual security requirements for each tier. |
| Incident reporting readiness score is zero | No incident handling controls documented in assessment | Complete Measure 2 (Incident Handling) controls in the assessment JSON, including detection capabilities, classification procedures, and CSIRT reporting integration. |

---

## Success Criteria

- All in-scope entities correctly classified as Essential or Important with documented rationale for the classification decision

- Incident reporting procedures tested and validated against the 24h/72h/1-month staged timeline, with documented CSIRT contact and reporting templates
- Management body members have completed mandatory cybersecurity training with documented attendance and knowledge assessment records
- Supply chain security program covers 100% of Tier 1 (critical) suppliers with quality agreements, right-to-audit clauses, and incident notification requirements in contracts
- Gap analysis produces a prioritized remediation roadmap with assigned owners, budgets, and milestone dates for every identified gap
- Quarterly compliance reassessments demonstrate measurable improvement with trending metrics reported to management

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- NIS2 Directive (EU 2022/2555) compliance assessment and gap analysis
- Entity classification (Essential vs Important) per Annex I and Annex II
- All 10 Article 21 minimum security measures assessment
