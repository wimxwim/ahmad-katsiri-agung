## Clarify First

Before assessing the breach, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **T0 — the moment of awareness** — starts the 72h clock; every deadline and "time remaining" in the timeline is calculated from it
- [ ] **Your role: controller or processor** — determines whether you notify the SA/data subjects (Art. 33/34) or only the controller (Art. 33(2))
- [ ] **Data categories, scale, and ease of identification** — these are the DPC/EI inputs that drive the ENISA severity score and verdict (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/VERY HIGH)
- [ ] **Which regulations apply** — GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIS2, AI Act — sets which notification deadlines and authorities the matrix produces

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the assessment.

## Tools

### Breach Severity Calculator

Calculates ENISA breach severity score from breach parameters. Determines notification obligations based on severity verdict.

```bash
# Calculate severity from parameters
python scripts/breach_severity_calculator.py \
  --dpc 3 --ei 0.75 \
  --confidentiality 0.5 --integrity 0.25 --availability 0 \
  --malicious

# JSON output
python scripts/breach_severity_calculator.py \
  --dpc 2 --ei 0.5 --confidentiality 0.5 --json

# With T0 timestamp for countdown
python scripts/breach_severity_calculator.py \
  --dpc 3 --ei 1.0 --confidentiality 0.5 \
  --t0 "2026-04-10T08:00:00" --json

# Generate input template
python scripts/breach_severity_calculator.py --template
```

**Output includes:**
- ENISA severity score (SE)
- Severity verdict: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH
- Notification obligations (SA, data subjects, public)
- Time remaining for GDPR 72h notification from T0

---

### Breach Timeline Tracker

Tracks breach response timeline from T0 (moment of awareness). Records events, monitors deadlines, and generates status dashboards.

```bash
# Initialize a new breach timeline
python scripts/breach_timeline_tracker.py init \
  --breach-id "BR-2026-001" --t0 "2026-04-10T08:00:00" \
  --description "Unauthorized database access" \
  --output breach_timeline.json

# Record an event
python scripts/breach_timeline_tracker.py event \
  --timeline breach_timeline.json \
  --action "Containment team activated" --category containment

# View status dashboard
python scripts/breach_timeline_tracker.py status --timeline breach_timeline.json

# Check deadlines
python scripts/breach_timeline_tracker.py deadlines --timeline breach_timeline.json

# JSON status output
python scripts/breach_timeline_tracker.py status --timeline breach_timeline.json --json
```

**Tracks:**
- GDPR 72-hour SA notification deadline
- DPA contractual deadlines (24h / 48h processor notification)
- NIS2 24-hour early warning and 72-hour notification
- Completed vs. pending response actions
- Time elapsed and time remaining per deadline

---

## Reference Guides

### ENISA Methodology
`references/enisa_methodology.md`

Complete ENISA breach severity methodology:
- DPC (Data Processing Context) scoring 1-4
- EI (Ease of Identification) scoring 0.25-1.00
- CB (Circumstances of Breach) additive scoring
- Formula: SE = (DPC x EI) + CB
- Adjustments for encryption, pseudonymization, volume
- EDPB case matching (18 reference cases)

### Notification Obligations
`references/notification_obligations.md`

Multi-regulation notification requirements:
- GDPR Art. 33 (SA within 72h) and Art. 34 (data subjects)
- CCPA, HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIS2, state breach notification
- Controller vs. Processor obligation matrix
- Cross-border notification rules
- AI Act Art. 62 serious incident reporting

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Standard Breach Response

```
Step 1: Emergency check — is there <12h remaining on any deadline?
        → If yes, skip to Step 4 (emergency notification)

Step 2: Initialize breach timeline
        → python scripts/breach_timeline_tracker.py init --breach-id "BR-2026-001" \
          --t0 "2026-04-10T08:00:00" --description "Description"

Step 3: Calculate severity
        → python scripts/breach_severity_calculator.py --dpc N --ei N \
          --confidentiality N --integrity N --availability N [--malicious]

Step 4: Based on severity verdict, determine notifications
        → LOW (<2): Internal log only, no external notification
        → MEDIUM (2 to <3): Notify supervisory authority within 72h
        → HIGH (3 to <4): Notify SA + individual data subjects
        → VERY HIGH (>=4): Notify SA + data subjects + consider public notice

Step 5: Execute containment and record events
        → python scripts/breach_timeline_tracker.py event --timeline breach.json \
          --action "Action taken" --category containment

Step 6: Monitor deadlines continuously
        → python scripts/breach_timeline_tracker.py deadlines --timeline breach.json

Step 7: Complete notification obligations and document
```

### Workflow 2: Emergency Mode (<12h Remaining)

```
Step 1: Calculate severity immediately
        → python scripts/breach_severity_calculator.py --dpc N --ei N \
          --confidentiality N --t0 "original-t0" --json

Step 2: If MEDIUM or higher, prepare phased notification
        → Art. 33(4) allows phased notification when full information unavailable
        → Initial notification: what is known + promise of update
        → Supplementary notification: full details when available

Step 3: File initial SA notification before deadline expires

Step 4: Initialize timeline for ongoing tracking
        → Continue gathering information for supplementary notification

Step 5: Document emergency timeline and decisions
```

### Workflow 3: Processor Breach Notification

```
Step 1: Processor becomes aware of breach
        → T0 for processor = moment of awareness

Step 2: Processor must notify controller "without undue delay"
        → Check DPA for specific contractual deadline (24h/48h common)

Step 3: Controller's T0 starts when controller becomes aware
        → Controller's 72h clock starts at this point

Step 4: Controller assesses severity independently
        → python scripts/breach_severity_calculator.py (controller's assessment)

Step 5: Controller makes notification decisions
        → Processor provides information; controller decides on SA/subject notification
```

## ENISA Severity Formula

```
SE = (DPC x EI) + CB
```

| Component | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| DPC | 1-4 | Data Processing Context — nature and sensitivity of data |
| EI | 0.25-1.0 | Ease of Identification — how easily individuals can be identified |
| CB | -0.5 to +1.0 | Circumstances of Breach — additive factors (malicious intent, volume, loss type) |

### Severity Verdicts

| Score Range | Verdict | Notification Obligations |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------|
| <2 | LOW | Internal log only. No SA or subject notification required |
| 2 to <3 | MEDIUM | Notify supervisory authority within 72h (Art. 33) |
| 3 to <4 | HIGH | Notify SA within 72h + notify individual data subjects (Art. 34) |
| >=4 | VERY HIGH | Notify SA + data subjects + consider public notice; crisis management |

## Notification Decision Matrix

Quick reference for notification obligations per regulation and severity.

| Regulation | Authority Notification | Individual Notification | Trigger |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------|
| GDPR Art. 33 | SA within 72h | N/A | Unless unlikely to result in risk to rights/freedoms |
| GDPR Art. 34 | N/A | Without undue delay | When likely to result in high risk |
| CCPA | State AG | Affected consumers | Unencrypted personal information compromised |
| HIPAA | HHS within 60 days | Affected individuals | Unsecured PHI; >500: notify media |
| PCI DSS | Card brands within 24h | Cardholders (via issuer) | Cardholder data compromised |
| NIS2 Art. 23 | CSIRT within 24h (early warning), 72h (notification) | N/A | Significant incident |
| AI Act Art. 62 | Market surveillance within 15 days | N/A | Serious incident involving AI system |

### Controller vs. Processor Obligations

| Obligation | Controller | Processor |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Notify supervisory authority | Yes (Art. 33) | No (notify controller only) |
| Notify data subjects | Yes (Art. 34) | No |
| Document all breaches | Yes (Art. 33(5)) | Yes (assist controller) |
| Notify controller | N/A | Yes, without undue delay (Art. 33(2)) |
| Conduct severity assessment | Yes | Assist (provide information) |
| Timeline starts (T0) | When controller becomes aware | When processor becomes aware |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Severity score is borderline between MEDIUM and HIGH | Parameters are at threshold boundaries | Score conservatively — if near 3.0, treat as HIGH and notify data subjects; document the borderline analysis |
| 72-hour deadline approaching with incomplete information | Complex breach requiring ongoing investigation | Use Art. 33(4) phased notification — notify SA with available information and supplement later |
| Processor discovered breach but delayed notifying controller | DPA contractual deadline may have been missed | Document the delay; assess whether processor's delay affected controller's ability to comply; review DPA terms |
| Cross-border breach — unclear which SA to notify | Multi-jurisdictional processing with unclear lead SA | Notify the SA of your main establishment (one-stop-shop); if unclear, notify the SA where most affected subjects reside |
| Breach involves encrypted data — unclear if notification needed | Encryption may lower severity or eliminate notification | If encryption was effective (strong algorithm, key not compromised), this may make notification unnecessary per Art. 34(3)(a); document the analysis |
| AI system involved in breach — unclear additional obligations | AI Act Art. 62 may apply alongside GDPR | Assess whether AI system is high-risk under AI Act; if serious incident, notify market surveillance authority within 15 days in addition to GDPR obligations |

## Success Criteria

- **Breach severity calculated within 2 hours of awareness** -- ENISA methodology applied with documented parameters and scoring rationale
- **SA notification filed within 72 hours of T0** -- for MEDIUM or higher severity breaches, phased notification used when full information unavailable
- **Data subject notification completed without undue delay** -- for HIGH or higher severity breaches, clear communication of impact and protective measures
- **All response actions tracked with timestamps** -- breach timeline maintained from T0 through closure with all events recorded
- **Cross-regulation obligations identified and met** -- GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIS2, and AI Act obligations assessed and fulfilled per applicable law
- **Post-breach documentation complete** -- internal breach log maintained per Art. 33(5) regardless of notification decision

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- ENISA breach severity calculation with full parameter support
- GDPR Art. 33/34 notification timeline tracking
- Multi-regulation notification obligation assessment (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIS2, AI Act)
- Controller vs. processor obligation guidance
- Cross-border breach notification routing
- Phased notification guidance per Art. 33(4)
- Breach response event tracking and deadline monitoring

**Out of Scope:**
- Technical incident containment (network isolation, forensics, malware removal)
- Filing notifications with supervisory authorities (document preparation only)
- Insurance claim processing or coverage analysis
- Law enforcement coordination
- Public relations or crisis communications strategy
- Forensic investigation methodology

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Delaying T0 determination to buy more time** -- T0 is the moment the controller becomes "aware" of the breach, not when full details are known; deliberately delaying awareness to extend the 72-hour window is a compliance violation and will be treated as such by regulators
- **Defaulting to no notification without documented analysis** -- every breach must be documented and assessed, even if the conclusion is that notification is not required; "we decided not to notify" without documented severity analysis is indefensible
- **Treating processor notification as controller notification** -- processor notifying its own SA does not satisfy the controller's Art. 33 obligation; the controller must make its own independent notification decision and filing
- **Using encryption as an automatic notification exemption** -- Art. 34(3)(a) exemption requires that the encrypted data was rendered unintelligible AND the encryption key was not compromised; weak encryption or compromised keys do not qualify
- **Ignoring AI Act obligations for AI-involved breaches** -- if the breach involves a high-risk AI system, Art. 62 serious incident reporting (15 days to market surveillance authority) applies in addition to GDPR; these are separate obligations with different timelines
