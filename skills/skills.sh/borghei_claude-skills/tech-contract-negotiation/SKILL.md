# Tech Contract Negotiation Skill

## Overview

Production-ready negotiation toolkit for technology services agreements, professional services contracts, and B2B transactions. Provides a Three-Position Framework (provider-favorable, balanced, client-favorable) for every major provision, Deal-Size Tactics across 5 tiers, Five-Tier Objection Handling, regulatory leverage arguments, and concession roadmaps. Designed for legal counsel, procurement leads, and sales/deal desk teams negotiating technology contracts from $100K to $10M+.

## Clarify First

Before the analysis, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Which side you are on** — provider vs client — the `--perspective` input that flips position classification and your target positions
- [ ] **Deal value + complexity parameters** — drive the deal tier (1-5), expected timeline, and number of rounds
- [ ] **Your bright lines / non-negotiables** — define what cannot be conceded vs what can be traded in the concession roadmap
- [ ] **Applicable regulations** — GDPR, DORA, NIS2, SOX — determine which regulatory-leverage arguments are genuine vs would destroy credibility

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the analysis.

## Tools

### 1. Negotiation Position Analyzer (`scripts/negotiation_position_analyzer.py`)

Analyzes contract text and classifies each provision as provider-favorable, balanced, or client-favorable based on keyword patterns and structural analysis. Generates a position map and recommended negotiation priorities.

```bash
# Analyze a contract draft
python scripts/negotiation_position_analyzer.py contract_draft.txt

# JSON output for integration
python scripts/negotiation_position_analyzer.py contract_draft.txt --json

# Analyze from a specific party's perspective
python scripts/negotiation_position_analyzer.py contract_draft.txt --perspective client
```

### 2. Deal Complexity Scorer (`scripts/deal_complexity_scorer.py`)

Takes deal parameters and scores complexity across 7 dimensions. Recommends deal tier (1-5), expected timeline, number of rounds, and key focus areas.

```bash
# Score deal complexity from parameters file
python scripts/deal_complexity_scorer.py deal_params.json

# JSON output
python scripts/deal_complexity_scorer.py deal_params.json --json

# Override deal value for quick what-if
python scripts/deal_complexity_scorer.py deal_params.json --deal-value 5000000
```

## Reference Guides

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `references/three_position_framework.md` | Provider/balanced/client positions for 5 major provisions with deal-size tactics |
| `references/objection_handling.md` | Five-tier objection methodology, prediction matrix, communication templates |
| `references/regulatory_leverage.md` | GDPR, DORA, NIS2, SOX leverage arguments, concession roadmap, industry considerations |

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Pre-Negotiation Assessment

1. **Classify the deal** -- Run `deal_complexity_scorer.py` with deal parameters to determine tier, timeline, and focus areas
2. **Analyze the draft** -- Run `negotiation_position_analyzer.py` on the initial contract to map current positions
3. **Identify gaps** -- Compare position map against your target positions from `three_position_framework.md`
4. **Prepare objection responses** -- Review `objection_handling.md` for predicted objections based on client type
5. **Map regulatory leverage** -- Identify applicable frameworks from `regulatory_leverage.md`

### Workflow 2: Active Negotiation

1. **Open with position** -- Use the Opening Position Statement template from `objection_handling.md`
2. **Handle pushback** -- Apply Five-Tier Objection Handling: Acknowledge, Market Context, Business Rationale, Alternatives, Bright Lines
3. **Track concessions** -- Follow the 4-tier concession roadmap (Easy Gives through Bright Lines)
4. **Re-analyze after redlines** -- Run `negotiation_position_analyzer.py` on each revised draft
5. **Close** -- Use Closing the Deal template; verify no Bright Lines were crossed

### Workflow 3: Deal Review and Approval

1. **Final position analysis** -- Run analyzer on execution-ready draft
2. **Complexity validation** -- Confirm final terms match expected deal tier parameters
3. **Regulatory check** -- Verify all mandatory regulatory provisions are present
4. **Document concessions** -- Record what was traded and why for future negotiations
5. **Approval package** -- Combine position map, complexity score, and concession log

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Analyzer flags everything as "provider-favorable" | Input is a vendor's first draft (expected behavior) | Use `--perspective provider` to flip the analysis; compare against balanced baseline |
| Complexity scorer returns Tier 5 for a small deal | High regulatory or multi-jurisdictional flags triggered | Review the regulatory and jurisdiction inputs; lower if overestimated |
| Position map shows no IP provisions detected | Contract uses non-standard terminology for IP clauses | Check for terms like "work product," "deliverables ownership," or "background IP" manually |
| Deal timeline estimate seems too short | Scorer does not account for internal approval delays | Add internal review buffer (typically 1-2 weeks per approval level) to the estimated timeline |
| Objection framework doesn't cover a specific pushback | Counterparty raised an atypical demand | Start with Acknowledge tier; frame using closest Market Context example; escalate to Bright Lines if needed |
| Regulatory leverage arguments rejected as irrelevant | Framework doesn't apply to counterparty's jurisdiction | Verify which regulations actually bind each party; remove inapplicable leverage points |

## Success Criteria

- **Position Accuracy**: Analyzer correctly classifies 85%+ of provisions when validated against expert review
- **Deal Tier Alignment**: Complexity scorer tier matches actual negotiation effort within one tier for 90% of deals
- **Negotiation Efficiency**: Average number of negotiation rounds reduced by 30% compared to ad-hoc approach
- **Concession Tracking**: 100% of material concessions documented with rationale and trade-off analysis
- **Bright Line Protection**: Zero instances of crossing defined Bright Lines without executive escalation and approval
- **Regulatory Coverage**: All applicable regulatory provisions identified and addressed in 95%+ of contracts
- **Time-to-Signature**: Deals close within estimated timeline +/- 20% for 80% of negotiations

## Scope & Limitations

**This skill covers:**
- Technology services agreements, SaaS subscriptions, professional services contracts, and B2B licensing deals
- Negotiation position analysis for liability, IP, payment, SLA, and warranty provisions
- Deal complexity scoring with tier-based recommendations for timeline, rounds, and focus areas
- Regulatory leverage for GDPR, DORA, NIS2, and SOX in technology contract contexts
- Objection handling frameworks and communication templates for common negotiation scenarios

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Employment agreements, M&A transactions, real estate contracts, or consumer-facing terms of service
- Jurisdiction-specific legal advice or attorney-client privileged analysis (this is a framework, not legal counsel)
- Contract drafting from scratch (assumes an existing draft to analyze and negotiate)
- Litigation strategy, dispute resolution beyond contract clauses, or enforcement proceedings
- Price negotiation tactics for commodity purchases or non-technology procurement

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Treating every provision as a Bright Line | Counterparty disengages when everything is non-negotiable | Classify provisions into 4 concession tiers; trade Easy Gives early to build goodwill |
| Skipping deal complexity assessment | Under-preparing for complex deals or over-preparing for simple ones | Always run complexity scorer first to calibrate effort, timeline, and approval requirements |
| Using regulatory leverage when the regulation doesn't apply | Destroys credibility and trust with informed counterparties | Verify applicability before citing any regulation; use the genuine-vs-preference test from the framework |
| Accepting "this is our standard template" at face value | Every template is negotiable; accepting defaults leaves value on the table | Analyze the "standard" template with the position analyzer to identify moveable provisions |
| Negotiating provisions in isolation | Conceding on SLAs without linking to liability caps creates exposure | Use the Three-Position Framework holistically; link related provisions (SLAs to credits to liability) |

## Tool Reference

### `scripts/negotiation_position_analyzer.py`

Analyze contract text and classify provisions by negotiation position.

```
usage: negotiation_position_analyzer.py [-h] [--json] [--perspective {provider,client}]
                                         input_file

positional arguments:
  input_file            Path to contract text file (.txt or .md)

options:
