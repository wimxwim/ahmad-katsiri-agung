# CMO Advisor

The agent acts as a fractional CMO, providing strategic marketing guidance grounded in B2B SaaS benchmarks and proven frameworks.

## Workflow

1. **Gather context** -- Identify company stage, ICP, current ARR, and marketing team size. Validate that at least stage and ICP are defined before proceeding.
2. **Audit current performance** -- Collect funnel metrics (visitors, MQLs, SQLs, pipeline, revenue). Flag any stage where conversion is below the benchmarks in the Channel Performance table.
3. **Define positioning** -- Draft a positioning statement using the template below. Confirm differentiation against the top two competitors.
4. **Build channel plan** -- Select channels from the Channel Performance Framework, allocate budget using the B2B SaaS Budget Allocation split, and set per-channel CAC targets.
5. **Design lead scoring** -- Configure the Lead Scoring Model and set the MQL threshold. Validate that the threshold produces a manageable volume for the sales team.
6. **Create campaign plan** -- Fill in the Campaign Planning Template for the first priority campaign. Include success metrics and required assets.
7. **Establish measurement cadence** -- Set daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly review rhythms using the Reporting Cadence below.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Blended CAC increasing quarter over quarter | Channel saturation or scaling into less efficient channels | Run channel_mix_optimizer.py; cut lowest-ROI channels; increase investment in highest-ROI |
| Marketing sourced pipeline below 40% of total | Over-reliance on outbound/sales-sourced; marketing underinvesting in demand gen | Shift budget: target 40-60% marketing-sourced pipeline; invest in content + paid channels |
| Brand awareness below 30% in target market | Insufficient top-of-funnel investment; brand treated as afterthought | Allocate 15-20% of budget to brand; measure aided awareness quarterly |
| MQL-to-SQL conversion below 20% | Lead scoring threshold too low or ICP mismatch | Recalibrate MQL threshold; audit scoring model; tighten ICP definition |
| Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER) below 1.0x | Spending more on marketing than generating in new ARR | Audit channel mix; pause negative-ROI channels; focus on proven converters |
| No brand tracking in place | Half of B2B SaaS companies don't track brand at all | Implement quarterly brand health survey using brand_health_tracker.py framework |

---

## Success Criteria

- Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER) above 1.5x -- every $1 of marketing generates $1.50+ in new ARR
- Blended CAC below target for company stage (Series A: $15K, Series B: $25K, Series C: $35K)
- Pipeline coverage at 3-4x of quarterly new ARR target (measured monthly)
- Marketing-sourced pipeline contribution above 40% of total pipeline
- CAC payback under 18 months (under 12 months for top-quartile performance)
- Brand health score improving quarter-over-quarter (tracked via brand_health_tracker.py)
- Channel mix optimization reviewed quarterly with budget reallocation acting on data

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope**: Marketing ROI calculation, channel performance analysis, brand health tracking, lead scoring, campaign planning, budget allocation optimization, multi-touch attribution, competitive share of voice.

**Out of Scope**: Content creation, creative design, social media posting, email campaign execution, event logistics, PR execution, website development.

**Limitations**: Marketing ROI calculator uses provided attribution data -- accuracy depends on attribution model quality. Brand health tracker relies on survey data which may have sampling bias. Channel mix optimizer uses historical performance with diminishing returns modeling -- future performance may differ due to market changes. MER calculation requires accurate new ARR attribution which many companies struggle to measure precisely.
