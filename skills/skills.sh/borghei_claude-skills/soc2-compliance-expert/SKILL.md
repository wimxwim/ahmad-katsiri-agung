# SOC 2 Compliance Expert

SOC 2 Type I and Type II compliance management covering all Trust Services Criteria (TSC), infrastructure security validation, evidence collection, and end-to-end audit preparation.

---

## SOC 2 Overview

### Type I vs Type II

| Aspect | Type I | Type II |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Scope | Design of controls at a point in time | Design AND operating effectiveness over a period |
| Duration | Single date (snapshot) | Observation period (3-12 months, typically 6-12) |
| Cost | $20K-$60K (first audit) | $40K-$150K (first audit) |
| Timeline | 1-3 months | 6-15 months (includes observation period) |
| Customer Preference | Early-stage acceptable | Enterprise customers require |

Start with Type I to validate control design, then transition to Type II within 6 months.

### Trust Services Criteria Summary

| Category | Focus | Controls |
|----------|-------|----------|
| CC1-CC5 | Common Criteria (COSO-based) | Control environment, communication, risk, monitoring, control activities |
| CC6 | Logical and Physical Access | Authentication, authorization, physical security, encryption |
| CC7 | System Operations | Vulnerability management, monitoring, incident response, BCP |
| CC8 | Change Management | Authorization, testing, deployment controls |
| CC9 | Risk Mitigation | Vendor management, business disruption, risk transfer |
| A1 | Availability | Capacity planning, DR, recovery testing |
| PI1 | Processing Integrity | Data validation, error handling, reconciliation |
| C1 | Confidentiality | Classification, encryption, disposal |
| P1 | Privacy | Notice, consent, data subject rights, retention |

For detailed control requirements per category, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Clarify First

Before running the readiness assessment, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Report type** — Type I (design at a point in time) vs Type II (operating effectiveness over a period) (sets the observation-period requirement and timeline)
- [ ] **TSC scope** — which criteria beyond mandatory Security (Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy) (drives which controls and evidence are needed)
- [ ] **Subservice organizations** — carve-out vs inclusive (affects the scope and system description)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the assessment.

## Readiness Assessment Workflow

The agent guides organizations through SOC 2 readiness from gap analysis through audit completion.

### Workflow: Phase 1 -- Gap Analysis (Weeks 1-4)

1. **Define scope** -- determine which TSC categories to include (Security is mandatory), define system boundaries, identify subservice organizations (carve-out vs. inclusive), document principal service commitments.
2. **Assess current state** -- inventory existing policies and procedures, map current controls to TSC requirements, interview process owners and control operators.
3. **Run automated gap analysis** using `scripts/soc2_readiness_checker.py`.
4. **Document gaps** -- missing controls, controls lacking evidence, controls not operating effectively.
5. **Prioritize** gaps by risk level and remediation effort.
6. **Validation checkpoint:** Gap analysis covers all in-scope TSC categories; each gap has severity rating and remediation owner assigned.

### Workflow: Phase 2 -- Remediation (Weeks 5-16)

1. **Develop/update policies** -- information security policy, supporting procedures per control domain, policy review and approval workflows.
2. **Implement technical controls** -- configure IdP with SSO/MFA enforcement, deploy endpoint security (MDM, EDR, disk encryption), implement SIEM logging and monitoring, configure backup and DR, harden cloud infrastructure.
3. **Establish processes** -- access review procedures, change management workflow, incident response procedures, vendor management program, security awareness training.
4. **Set up evidence collection** -- configure automated collection, establish repository structure, define refresh cadence per TSC category.
5. **Validation checkpoint:** All identified gaps remediated; technical controls verified via `scripts/soc2_infrastructure_auditor.py`; evidence collection producing artifacts.

### Workflow: Phase 3 -- Pre-Audit (Weeks 17-20)

1. **Conduct internal readiness assessment** -- mock audit against all in-scope TSC, validate evidence completeness and quality, run infrastructure auditor for technical validation.
2. **Remediate pre-audit findings** -- address remaining gaps, strengthen evidence.
3. **Select and engage CPA firm** -- negotiate scope, timeline, fees; schedule kickoff; prepare system description draft.
4. **Validation checkpoint:** Mock audit passes with no critical gaps; system description reviewed; auditor engaged.

### Workflow: Phase 4 -- Audit Execution

1. **Type I audit** (if applicable) -- auditor reviews control design; management provides assertions; address findings before Type II.
2. **Type II observation period** (3-12 months) -- controls operate consistently, evidence collected continuously, quarterly self-assessments, regular auditor check-ins.
3. **Fieldwork** (2-4 weeks) -- auditor selects samples, tests controls, interviews personnel; draft report review; final report issuance.
4. **Validation checkpoint:** Clean opinion received; any findings have management response and remediation plan.

## Evidence Collection Framework

### Evidence by TSC Category

| TSC | Evidence Type | Collection Method | Refresh |
|-----|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| CC1 | Code of conduct acknowledgments | HR system export | Annual |
| CC2 | Security awareness training records | LMS export | Ongoing |
| CC3 | Risk assessment report, risk register | GRC platform | Annual/Quarterly |
| CC4 | Penetration test reports, vulnerability scans | Third-party/scanner | Annual/Monthly |
| CC5 | Policy documents with version history | Policy management | Annual review |
| CC6 | Access reviews, MFA enrollment, offboarding | IAM/IdP/HRIS | Quarterly/Per event |
| CC7 | Vulnerability remediation, incident records | Ticketing/ITSM | Ongoing |
| CC8 | Change tickets with approvals, code reviews | ITSM/Git | Per change |
| CC9 | Vendor risk assessments, vendor SOC 2 reports | GRC platform | Annual |
| A1 | Uptime reports, DR tests, backup logs | Monitoring/backup | Monthly/Semi-annual |
| PI1 | Data validation/reconciliation reports | Application logs | Per process |
| C1 | Data classification inventory, encryption configs | Manual/automated | Annual/Quarterly |
| P1 | PIAs, DSR response tracking | Privacy tool | Per event |

### Example: Evidence Collection Command

```bash
# Generate evidence checklist for all TSC categories
python scripts/evidence_collector.py --generate-checklist --categories all

# Track evidence status
python scripts/evidence_collector.py --status evidence-tracker.json

# Update specific evidence item
python scripts/evidence_collector.py --update evidence-tracker.json \
  --item CC6.1-MFA --status collected

# Generate readiness dashboard
python scripts/evidence_collector.py --dashboard evidence-tracker.json

# Export for auditor review
python scripts/evidence_collector.py --export evidence-tracker.json --format json
```

### Automation Strategies

**GRC Platforms:** Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, Laika, AuditBoard -- automated evidence collection via API integrations, continuous control monitoring, auditor collaboration portals.

**Infrastructure-as-Evidence:** Cloud configuration snapshots (AWS Config, Azure Policy, GCP Org Policies), Terraform state as configuration evidence, Git history as change management evidence, CI/CD pipeline logs as deployment control evidence.

---

## Infrastructure Security Validation

The agent validates infrastructure configurations against SOC 2 requirements.

### Quick Reference: Infrastructure Checks

| Domain | Key Checks | SOC 2 Mapping |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) | Encryption, IAM, logging, network, backup, secrets | CC6, CC7, A1, C1 |
| DNS | SPF, DKIM, DMARC, DNSSEC, CAA | CC6.6, CC2.2 |
| TLS/SSL | TLS 1.2+, AEAD ciphers, HSTS, auto-renewal | CC6.7 |
| Endpoint | MDM, disk encryption, EDR, patching, screen lock | CC6.1, CC6.8, CC7.1 |
| Network | Segmentation, WAF, DDoS, VPN/ZTNA, egress filtering | CC6.6, A1.1 |
| Container | Image scanning, minimal base, no privileged, RBAC | CC6.1, CC7.1 |
| CI/CD | Signed commits, branch protection, SAST/DAST, SBOM | CC7.1, CC8.1 |
| Secrets | Vault storage, rotation policies, git scanning | CC6.1 |

For detailed per-provider control mappings, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#infrastructure-security-checks).

### Example: Infrastructure Audit Command

```bash
# Full infrastructure audit
python scripts/soc2_infrastructure_auditor.py --config infra-config.json

# Audit specific domains only
python scripts/soc2_infrastructure_auditor.py --config infra-config.json \
  --domains dns tls cloud

# JSON output with severity ratings
python scripts/soc2_infrastructure_auditor.py --config infra-config.json --format json

# Generate sample configuration template
python scripts/soc2_infrastructure_auditor.py --generate-template
```

## Audit Timeline

### Typical Timeline (First SOC 2)

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Scoping | 2-4 weeks | Define TSC, system boundaries, auditor selection |
| Gap Analysis | 2-4 weeks | Assess current controls, identify gaps |
| Remediation | 8-16 weeks | Implement missing controls, policies, procedures |
| Type I Audit | 2-4 weeks | Point-in-time control design assessment |
| Type II Observation | 3-12 months | Controls operate, evidence collected continuously |
| Type II Fieldwork | 2-4 weeks | Auditor testing, evidence review, interviews |
| Report Issuance | 2-4 weeks | Draft review, management response, final report |

### Annual Renewal

- Begin renewal planning 3 months before observation period ends
- Maintain continuous compliance between audit periods
- Address prior-year findings before new observation period
- Bridge letters available for gaps between reports

---

## Incident Response Requirements

### IRP Structure

1. **Preparation** -- IR team defined, communication channels established, runbooks for common incidents, legal/PR contacts on retainer.
2. **Detection and Analysis** -- monitoring/alerting coverage, severity classification (SEV1-SEV4), triage procedures, escalation matrix.
3. **Containment, Eradication, Recovery** -- isolate affected systems, preserve evidence, identify root cause, restore and validate.
4. **Post-Incident** -- blameless post-mortem within 5 business days, lessons learned, control improvements, notification assessment (MTTD, MTTR, MTTC tracking).

For severity level definitions and breach notification timelines, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#incident-response-plan).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Readiness checker scores are 0% across all categories | Controls JSON missing `config_key` values or all set to false | Verify the input JSON maps each TSC control to a boolean value under the correct `config_key`. Run `--generate-sample > sample-config.json` to see the expected structure. |
| Infrastructure auditor reports all checks as "fail" | Infrastructure config JSON is empty or uses wrong key names | Run `--generate-template` to produce a valid template. Populate DNS, TLS, cloud, endpoint, and other sections with actual infrastructure state. |
| Evidence collector checklist missing categories | `--categories` flag filtering output | Use `--categories all` to generate the complete checklist. Available categories: `security`, `availability`, `processing_integrity`, `confidentiality`, `privacy`. |
| Evidence tracker status not updating | Tracker file path incorrect or file not writable | Verify the path passed to `--status` or `--update` points to an existing tracker JSON file. Check file permissions. |
| Cloud mapping not appearing in readiness report | `--cloud-mapping` flag not included | Add `--cloud-mapping` to the readiness checker command to include AWS/Azure/GCP control mappings in the output. |
| Type II observation period too short for auditor | Observation period is less than 3 months | Most CPA firms require a minimum 3-month observation period for Type II. A 6-12 month period carries more weight. Plan the observation window during the scoping phase. |
| Auditor requests evidence not in the tracker | Evidence catalog does not cover all TSC subcriteria for the selected scope | Supplement the auto-generated checklist with auditor-specific evidence requests. Each CPA firm may have additional requirements beyond the standard TSC evidence items. |

## Success Criteria

- SOC 2 scope defined with all applicable TSC categories selected, system boundaries documented, and subservice organizations identified (carve-out vs inclusive)
- Gap analysis completed with every identified gap assigned a severity rating, remediation owner, and target completion date
- Readiness score of 80%+ across all in-scope TSC categories before engaging the CPA firm, trending to 95%+ before Type II fieldwork
- Evidence collection framework operational with centralized repository, defined refresh cadence per TSC category, and automated collection where possible
- Infrastructure audit passes with no critical or high-severity findings in DNS, TLS, cloud, endpoint, or access control domains
- Type II observation period of at least 6 months with continuous control operation, quarterly self-assessments, and no significant control failures
- Clean SOC 2 Type II opinion received with any findings addressed by management response and documented remediation plans

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- SOC 2 Type I and Type II readiness assessment against all TSC categories (CC1-CC9, A1, PI1, C1, P1)
- Infrastructure security validation (DNS, TLS, cloud, endpoint, network, container, CI/CD, secrets)
- Evidence collection framework generation and tracking
- Gap analysis with severity-rated findings and remediation guidance
- Audit timeline planning and CPA firm engagement preparation
- Incident response plan structure and requirements
- Continuous compliance program design

**Out of Scope:**
- CPA firm audit execution (the tools prepare for audit; the actual Type I/II report requires an independent CPA firm)
- SOC 1 (ICFR) assessment (SOC 1 covers financial reporting controls, not security/availability/privacy)
- SOC 3 report generation (SOC 3 is a public-facing summary derived from SOC 2; it requires a completed SOC 2 audit)
- Penetration testing execution (use infrastructure-compliance-auditor or engage a third-party pentest firm)
- GRC platform selection or implementation (the skill is compatible with Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, etc., but does not implement them)
- Legal advice on customer contractual requirements for SOC 2 reports
- Physical security assessments (the infrastructure auditor covers logical controls; physical data center audits require on-site assessment)

## Integration Points

| Skill | Integration |
|-------|------------|
| [infrastructure-compliance-auditor](../infrastructure-compliance-auditor/) | Provides Vanta-level infrastructure checks across cloud, DNS, TLS, endpoints, access controls, and CI/CD that map directly to SOC 2 TSC requirements |
| [nist-csf-specialist](../nist-csf-specialist/) | NIST CSF functions map to SOC 2 TSC categories; use the control mapper to build unified control matrices for organizations pursuing both |
| [information-security-manager-iso27001](../information-security-manager-iso27001/) | ISO 27001 Annex A controls provide a management system backbone that satisfies many SOC 2 requirements; shared evidence reduces audit burden |
| [pci-dss-specialist](../pci-dss-specialist/) | PCI DSS requirements overlap with SOC 2 CC6 (access), CC7 (operations), CC8 (change management); shared controls for payment-processing organizations |
| [gdpr-dsgvo-expert](../gdpr-dsgvo-expert/) | GDPR requirements align with SOC 2 Privacy (P1) criteria; organizations processing EU personal data can leverage shared privacy controls |
| [nis2-directive-specialist](../nis2-directive-specialist/) | NIS2 minimum security measures overlap with SOC 2 security criteria; EU entities can map shared incident response, access control, and encryption controls |
