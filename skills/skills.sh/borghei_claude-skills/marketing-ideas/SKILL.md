# Marketing Ideas

139+ proven marketing strategies with implementation guidance matched to stage, budget, and goals. This file is a lean map — browse the full tactic catalog and frameworks in the references below.

## Core Capabilities

- **Curated idea selection** — match 3-5 of 92 cataloged tactics to a team's stage, budget, goal, and timeline
- **Campaign ideation** — run structured sessions that generate, score, and brief fresh ideas against constraints
- **Trend analysis** — identify emerging trends and evaluate them for relevance, risk, and brand fit before committing
- **Prioritization & briefing** — score ideas on impact/effort/alignment and produce execution-ready implementation briefs

## When to Use

- Brainstorming marketing or growth ideas for a specific stage, budget, or goal
- Planning a growth strategy and needing a curated shortlist instead of a generic dump
- Running a campaign ideation session that needs structure and scoring
- Evaluating whether to act on an emerging marketing trend

## Quick Start

### Get Curated Ideas for Your Situation

1. Define your stage (pre-launch, early, growth, scale)
2. Define your budget (free, low, medium, high)
3. Define your goal (leads, authority, retention, awareness)
4. Use the filtering tables in `references/idea-catalog.md` to find 3-5 matching ideas
5. For each idea: review implementation steps, expected timeline, and resource requirements

### Run a Campaign Ideation Session

1. Define the campaign objective and constraints
2. Use the Campaign Ideation Framework (`references/ideation-and-trends.md`) to generate 15-20 raw ideas
3. Score each idea on effort, impact, and alignment
4. Select the top 3-5 for execution planning
5. Build implementation briefs for each selected idea

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:** 139+ marketing ideas organized by category/stage/budget/timeline, campaign ideation frameworks, idea scoring and prioritization, campaign brief generation, trend identification and evaluation, quick win identification, PLG strategy ideas.

**Out of Scope:** Detailed implementation for each idea (see channel-specific skills), budget allocation optimization (see marketing-analyst skill), execution tracking and analytics (see campaign-analytics skill), content creation (see content-creator skill).

**Limitations:** This skill provides strategy and ideas, not execution. Each idea requires a channel-specific skill for full implementation. Impact estimates (High/Medium/Low) are directional based on benchmarks; actual results depend on execution quality, market fit, and timing. Trend evaluation is subjective and should be combined with data analysis.
