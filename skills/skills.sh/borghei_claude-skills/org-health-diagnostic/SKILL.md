## Clarify First

Before generating, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Company stage** (Seed / Series A / B / C+) — sets both the dimension weighting and the stage-adjusted benchmarks; a Seed company is not held to Series C standards
- [ ] **Which dimensions have data and the actual metric values** — the diagnostic degrades gracefully, but it must know what's measured vs. missing to avoid scoring on guesses
- [ ] **The purpose and audience** (internal prioritization, board review, QoQ comparison) — determines depth, whether cascade analysis is included, and the output format
- [ ] **Any known problem areas or recent shocks** — focuses cascade analysis on where failures are likely propagating

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Scoring System

### Individual Dimension Score

Each dimension scores 1-10 based on weighted metrics:

```
Dimension Score = Sum(metric_score x metric_weight) / Sum(weights)

Traffic Light:
  Green (7-10):  Healthy -- maintain and optimize
  Yellow (4-6):  Watch -- trend matters (improving or declining?)
  Red (1-3):     Action required -- address within 30 days
```

### Overall Health Score

Weighted average by company stage:

| Dimension | Seed Weight | Series A | Series B | Series C+ |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Financial | 20% | 15% | 15% | 15% |
| Revenue | 10% | 20% | 20% | 20% |
| Product | 25% | 20% | 15% | 10% |
| Engineering | 15% | 15% | 15% | 10% |
| People | 10% | 10% | 15% | 15% |
| Operations | 5% | 10% | 10% | 15% |
| Security | 5% | 5% | 5% | 10% |
| Market | 10% | 5% | 5% | 5% |

### Stage-Adjusted Benchmarks

Different stages have different healthy ranges. A Seed company with 6-month runway is normal; a Series C company with 6-month runway is a crisis.

| Stage | Runway Target | Burn Multiple | Team Size | Revenue Threshold |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Seed | > 12 months | Not applicable | 2-10 | Pre-revenue acceptable |
| Series A | > 18 months | < 3x | 10-40 | > $500K ARR |
| Series B | > 18 months | < 2x | 30-100 | > $3M ARR |
| Series C+ | > 24 months | < 1.5x | 80-300 | > $15M ARR |

## Cascade Analysis

### How Dimension Failures Propagate

This is the most important part of the diagnostic. Problems in one dimension inevitably create problems in others.

| If This Is Red... | Watch These Next... | Why |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Financial | People -> Engineering -> Product | Budget cuts -> hiring freeze -> velocity drops -> product stalls |
| Revenue | Financial -> People -> Market | Cash gap -> attrition risk -> positioning weakens |
| Product | Revenue -> Market -> People | NRR drops -> CAC rises -> top talent leaves |
| Engineering | Product -> Revenue | Features slip -> deals stall on missing features |
| People | Engineering -> Product -> Revenue | Velocity drops -> quality drops -> churn rises |
| Operations | ALL dimensions degrade over time | Execution failure cascades everywhere |
| Security | Revenue (enterprise) -> Financial | Enterprise deals blocked -> revenue impact |
| Market | Revenue -> Financial | Lead pipeline dries up -> sales suffers |

### Cascade Risk Decision Tree

```
START: Dimension scores calculated
  |
  v
[Any dimension RED?]
  |
  +-- NO  --> [Any dimension YELLOW with declining trend?]
  |            |
  |            +-- YES --> Monitor cascade. Check connected dimensions.
  |            +-- NO  --> Healthy. Maintain current approach.
  |
  +-- YES --> [Check cascade connections]
              |
              v
            [Are connected dimensions also Yellow/Red?]
              |
              +-- YES --> SYSTEMIC ISSUE. Root cause in the Red dimension.
              |           Address Red dimension first. Connected will improve.
              |
              +-- NO  --> ISOLATED ISSUE. Fix Red dimension before it cascades.
                          Timeline: 30 days or cascade begins.

## Dashboard Output Format

```
ORG HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC -- [Company] -- [Date]
Stage: [Seed/A/B/C]   Overall: [Score]/10   Trend: [Improving/Stable/Declining]

DIMENSION SCORES
------------------------------------------------------------
  Financial     [G] 8.2  Runway 14mo, burn 1.6x
  Revenue       [Y] 5.8  NRR 104%, pipeline thin (1.8x)
  Product       [G] 7.4  NPS 42, DAU/MAU 38%
  Engineering   [Y] 5.2  Debt at 30%, MTTR 3.2h

  Operations    [Y] 6.0  OKR 65% completion
  Security      [G] 7.8  SOC 2 complete, 0 incidents
  Market        [Y] 5.5  CAC rising, win rate 22%
------------------------------------------------------------

TOP PRIORITIES (address in order)
[R] 1. People: attrition at 24%
       Impact: Engineering velocity drops in 60 days (cascade risk)
       Action: Retention audit + intervention for top 5 at-risk
       Owner: CHRO + CEO | Timeline: This week

[Y] 2. Revenue: pipeline at 1.8x
       Impact: Q+1 miss risk is high
       Action: Add 3 qualified opps in 30 days or adjust forecast
       Owner: CRO | Timeline: 30 days

[Y] 3. Engineering: tech debt at 30%
       Impact: Shipping velocity slows by Q3
       Action: Dedicated debt sprint plan
       Owner: CTO | Timeline: 45 days

CASCADE WARNING
  People [R] --> Engineering [Y] cascade risk
  If attrition continues: engineering velocity drops -> product delays
  -> revenue impact in 2 quarters

DATA GAPS
  [!] Market: Brand awareness data needed
  [!] Operations: Meeting effectiveness not measured
```

## Graceful Degradation

Not all data is always available. The diagnostic handles partial data:

| Data Availability | Approach |
|------------------|----------|
| All metrics available | Full scoring, all dimensions |
| Missing 1-2 metrics per dimension | Score available metrics, flag gaps |
| Missing entire dimension | Exclude from overall score, flag as "[data needed]" |
| Only 3-4 dimensions have data | Partial diagnostic, clearly marked |

---

## Diagnostic Cadence

| Frequency | Scope | Audience |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Weekly | Scorecard metrics only (2-3 per dimension) | Leadership team |
| Monthly | Full 8-dimension assessment | CEO + direct reports |
| Quarterly | Deep diagnostic with cascade analysis + benchmarks | Board-ready report |
| Annual | Full diagnostic + year-over-year comparison + strategy implications | Board + investors |

---

## Red Flags

- Any dimension Red for 2+ consecutive months -- systemic problem, not a blip
- 3+ dimensions Yellow simultaneously -- organizational strain, prioritize ruthlessly
- Overall score declining 3+ months -- strategic review needed
- Cascade warning triggered and not addressed in 30 days -- will get worse
- Data gaps persist for 2+ cycles -- measurement culture problem
- Score improving but team sentiment declining -- measurement gaming
- No dimension ever Red -- either the company is exceptional or standards are too low

---

## Integration with C-Suite

| Dimension | Owner Skill | Drill-Down |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Financial | CFO Advisor (`cfo-advisor`) | Deep financial analysis |
| Revenue | CRO Advisor (`cro-advisor`) | Pipeline and retention analysis |
| Product | CPO Advisor (`cpo-advisor`) | PMF assessment and portfolio review |
| Engineering | CTO Advisor (`cto-advisor`) | Technical health and debt analysis |
| People | CHRO Advisor (`chro-advisor`) | Retention, engagement, org design |
| Operations | COO Advisor (`coo-advisor`) | Process maturity, execution cadence |
| Security | CISO Advisor (`ciso-advisor`) | Risk register, compliance status |
| Market | CMO Advisor (`cmo-advisor`) | Positioning, channel effectiveness |

## Output Artifacts

| Request | Deliverable |
|---------|-------------|
| "How healthy is the company?" | Full 8-dimension dashboard with traffic lights |
| "What should we fix first?" | Prioritized action list with cascade analysis |
| "Prepare health section for board" | Board-ready health summary with trends |
| "Compare to last quarter" | Quarter-over-quarter comparison with trend arrows |
| "Where are we at risk?" | Cascade risk map with interconnected failures |
| "What data do we need?" | Data gap analysis with collection recommendations |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Scores consistently show all green but team sentiment is negative | Metrics being gamed or standards set too low; measurement doesn't capture reality | Cross-reference quantitative scores with qualitative signals (exit interviews, Glassdoor, skip-level conversations); raise benchmarks to industry-standard levels |
| Cascade analysis shows systemic issue but leadership disagrees | Red dimension owners resistant to acknowledging problems | Present cascade evidence with data: "People Red for 2 months → Engineering Yellow → Product delays in pipeline"; use McKinsey OHI principle of benchmarking against external data |
| Data gaps persist across multiple diagnostic cycles | No measurement infrastructure; teams don't prioritize data collection | Assign data collection to specific owners with deadlines; start with proxy metrics where direct measurement is unavailable |
| Diagnostic takes too long to produce (> 2 weeks) | Trying to measure everything perfectly instead of using available data | Apply graceful degradation: score what you have, flag gaps, iterate; a partial diagnostic now beats a perfect one in 6 weeks |
| Different stakeholders interpret traffic light scores differently | No shared understanding of what Green/Yellow/Red means operationally | Document specific thresholds for each metric in each dimension; share calibration examples ("Red runway = less than 9 months at current burn") |
| Quarterly diagnostic shows no change despite interventions | Wrong interventions, or interventions not given enough time, or measuring lagging indicators | Verify interventions target root cause not symptoms; check leading indicators alongside lagging ones; allow 2 quarters for structural changes to show in scores |
| Board wants a single number but diagnostic is multi-dimensional | Board unfamiliar with the 8-dimension model | Provide the weighted overall score (1-10) as headline with stage-adjusted weighting; drill-down dimensions available on request |

---

## Success Criteria

- All 8 dimensions scored with traffic lights within 5 business days of data collection start
- Cascade analysis correctly predicts downstream impacts: when a Red dimension is not addressed, connected dimensions degrade within 2 quarters
- Stage-adjusted benchmarks applied correctly: Seed company not held to Series C standards and vice versa
- Top 3 priorities identified with specific owners, timelines, and verification methods
- Data gaps reduced by at least 50% between first and second diagnostic cycle
- Board-ready health summary produced quarterly with trend comparison to prior quarter
- Overall health score trending stable or improving over 3 consecutive quarters

---

## Scope & Limitations

- **In scope:** 8-dimension organizational health scoring, traffic light dashboards, cascade analysis, stage-adjusted benchmarks, graceful degradation for partial data, diagnostic cadence recommendations, board-ready reporting
- **Out of scope:** Deep functional diagnostics within a single dimension (use the respective C-suite advisor skill); employee engagement survey design and administration (use CHRO Advisor); financial auditing (use external auditors); security penetration testing (use CISO Advisor)
- **Limitation:** Diagnostic quality depends on data accuracy; garbage in, garbage out applies -- verify data sources
- **Limitation:** McKinsey OHI benchmarks are based on large enterprise data; early-stage companies may need adjusted benchmarks
- **Limitation:** The 8-dimension model is a simplification; some organizations may need additional dimensions (e.g., ESG, regulatory) depending on industry
- **Limitation:** Cascade predictions are based on common patterns; specific organizations may have unique cascade paths
