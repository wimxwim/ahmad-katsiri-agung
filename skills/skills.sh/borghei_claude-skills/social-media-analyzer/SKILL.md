## Clarify First

Before analyzing, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Platform** — Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or TikTok — selects the correct benchmark set for comparison
- [ ] **Post/campaign data** — likes, comments, shares, saves, reach per post — required; reach must be unique users, not impressions
- [ ] **Ad spend** — total spend for the period — determines whether ROI/CPE/ROAS is calculated
- [ ] **Analysis goal** — full audit, top-performer patterns, ROI, or competitor comparison — focuses the output artifact

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Analysis Workflow

Analyze social media campaign performance:

1. Validate input data completeness (reach > 0, dates valid)
2. Calculate engagement metrics per post
3. Aggregate campaign-level metrics
4. Calculate ROI if ad spend provided
5. Compare against platform benchmarks
6. Identify top and bottom performers
7. Generate recommendations
8. **Validation:** Engagement rate < 100%, ROI matches spend data

### Input Requirements

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| platform | Yes | instagram, facebook, twitter, linkedin, tiktok |
| posts[] | Yes | Array of post data |
| posts[].likes | Yes | Like/reaction count |
| posts[].comments | Yes | Comment count |
| posts[].reach | Yes | Unique users reached |
| posts[].impressions | No | Total views |
| posts[].shares | No | Share/retweet count |
| posts[].saves | No | Save/bookmark count |
| posts[].clicks | No | Link clicks |
| total_spend | No | Ad spend (for ROI) |

### Data Validation Checks

Before analysis, verify:

- [ ] Reach > 0 for all posts (avoid division by zero)
- [ ] Engagement counts are non-negative
- [ ] Date range is valid (start < end)
- [ ] Platform is recognized
- [ ] Spend > 0 if ROI requested

---

## Engagement Metrics

### Engagement Rate Calculation

```
Engagement Rate = (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Reach × 100
```

### Metric Definitions

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Engagement Rate | Engagements / Reach × 100 | Audience interaction level |
| CTR | Clicks / Impressions × 100 | Content click appeal |
| Reach Rate | Reach / Followers × 100 | Content distribution |
| Virality Rate | Shares / Impressions × 100 | Share-worthiness |
| Save Rate | Saves / Reach × 100 | Content value |

### Performance Categories

| Rating | Engagement Rate | Action |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Excellent | > 6% | Scale and replicate |
| Good | 3-6% | Optimize and expand |
| Average | 1-3% | Test improvements |
| Poor | < 1% | Analyze and pivot |

---

## ROI Calculation

Calculate return on ad spend:

1. Sum total engagements across posts
2. Calculate cost per engagement (CPE)
3. Calculate cost per click (CPC) if clicks available
4. Estimate engagement value using benchmark rates
5. Calculate ROI percentage
6. **Validation:** ROI = (Value - Spend) / Spend × 100

### ROI Formulas

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Cost Per Engagement (CPE) | Total Spend / Total Engagements |
| Cost Per Click (CPC) | Total Spend / Total Clicks |
| Cost Per Thousand (CPM) | (Spend / Impressions) × 1000 |
| Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) | Revenue / Ad Spend |

### Engagement Value Estimates

| Action | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Like | $0.50 | Brand awareness |
| Comment | $2.00 | Active engagement |
| Share | $5.00 | Amplification |
| Save | $3.00 | Intent signal |
| Click | $1.50 | Traffic value |

### ROI Interpretation

| ROI % | Rating | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| > 500% | Excellent | Scale budget significantly |
| 200-500% | Good | Increase budget moderately |
| 100-200% | Acceptable | Optimize before scaling |
| 0-100% | Break-even | Review targeting and creative |
| < 0% | Negative | Pause and restructure |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Engagement rate appears unrealistically high (>50%) | Reach value is too low relative to engagements, or reach/impressions data is swapped | Verify that `reach` represents unique users reached (not impressions). Engagement rate = (likes + comments + shares + saves) / reach. If using Instagram data from 2025+, note that Instagram shifted from "impressions" to "views" as primary metric -- ensure you are using the correct field |
| Benchmark comparison shows "no_benchmark_available" | Platform name in input JSON does not match expected values | Use exact lowercase platform names: `instagram`, `facebook`, `twitter`, `linkedin`, `tiktok`. The analyzer matches against these exact strings |
| ROI calculation shows negative despite good engagement | Engagement value estimates are too conservative for your industry | The default engagement value model uses $0.50/like, $2.00/comment, $5.00/share, $3.00/save, $1.50/click. Adjust these values in `calculate_metrics.py` for your specific vertical. B2B companies typically have higher per-engagement values than B2C |
| TikTok metrics show low engagement compared to benchmarks | Using reach-based calculation on a platform where view-based metrics are standard | TikTok's 2026 benchmark engagement rate of 2.50-3.70% is calculated against views, not reach. Ensure your TikTok data uses video views in the `reach` field for accurate comparison. TikTok engagement rates rose 49% YoY in 2025 |
| LinkedIn engagement appears lower than expected | Comparing against outdated benchmarks | LinkedIn's 2026 median engagement rate is approximately 3.85-6.1%, significantly higher than other platforms. Carousel/document posts earn the highest engagement (up to 21.77% median). If your rate is below 2%, focus on conversation-starting content rather than corporate announcements |
| Instagram metrics declining despite consistent content quality | Algorithm and metric definition changes in 2025-2026 | Instagram shifted to "Views" as its primary metric across all formats (Reels, Stories, posts), replacing "Impressions" and "Plays." Carousel posts now earn the most engagement. Meta plans to replace reach with "Viewers" metric in Graph API by June 2026. Adapt your data collection accordingly |
| Campaign analysis has too few posts for reliable insights | Small sample size produces unreliable averages | Minimum 10 posts recommended for meaningful analysis. The `analyze_performance.py` script flags campaigns with fewer than 10 posts. For statistical reliability, aim for 30+ posts per analysis period |

## Success Criteria

- **Engagement Rate by Platform (2026 benchmarks)**: Instagram 0.50-0.70% (average), 3-6% (good), >6% (excellent). Facebook 0.06-0.09% (average), 0.5-1% (good). LinkedIn 3.85-6.1% (average), >6% (good). TikTok 2.50-3.70% (average), 8-15% (good), >15% (excellent). Twitter/X 0.03-0.05% (average), 0.1-0.5% (good)
- **Click-Through Rate**: Instagram >0.5% (good), Facebook >1.5% (good), LinkedIn >1.0% (good), TikTok >0.5% (good). Featured snippets and carousels drive highest CTR across platforms
- **Cost Per Click**: Facebook <$0.50 (good), Instagram <$0.70 (good), LinkedIn <$3.00 (good, but averages $4-5+ for B2B), TikTok <$0.50 (good). LinkedIn CPC has risen 89% since 2023
- **ROI Threshold**: Target minimum 200% ROI on paid social. Campaigns above 500% are excellent and should be scaled. Campaigns below 100% need immediate creative or targeting revision
- **Content Format Performance**: Prioritize high-engagement formats per platform -- carousel/document posts on LinkedIn (21.77% median engagement), Reels on Instagram, short-form video on TikTok. Test at least 3 content formats per month
- **Posting Frequency**: Maintain consistent posting cadence: LinkedIn 3-5x/week, Instagram 4-7x/week, TikTok 3-5x/week. The LinkedIn algorithm favors content that generates meaningful engagement in the first 90 minutes
- **Analysis Cadence**: Run full performance analysis weekly for active campaigns. Compare month-over-month trends to identify growth or decline patterns. Update benchmark baselines quarterly as platform norms shift rapidly

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- Post-level and campaign-level engagement metrics (engagement rate, CTR, reach rate, virality rate, save rate)
- ROI calculation with engagement value estimates and cost efficiency metrics (CPE, CPC, CPM, ROAS)
- Platform benchmark comparison for Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and TikTok
- Top/bottom performer identification and ranking
- Actionable recommendations based on benchmark assessment

**Out of Scope:**
- Real-time API connections to social media platforms (scripts analyze static JSON data you export)
- Social media scheduling, publishing, or content creation
- Follower growth tracking or audience demographics analysis
- Competitor social media monitoring (use dedicated social listening tools)
- Influencer identification or collaboration management
- Social commerce and shopping metrics
- Video-specific analytics (watch time, completion rate, drop-off points)
- Sentiment analysis on comments or mentions (use the app-store-optimization skill's review_analyzer for text sentiment)
- Cross-platform identity resolution or deduplication

**Platform API Changes (2025-2026):**
- Meta/Instagram is replacing "reach" with "Viewers" metric in Graph API by June 2026
- Instagram shifted to "Views" as primary metric across all formats, replacing "Impressions" and "Plays"
- TikTok tightened API access approval process in 2025
- LinkedIn added AI-powered conversational search; algorithm now favors people-first content over polished corporate updates
