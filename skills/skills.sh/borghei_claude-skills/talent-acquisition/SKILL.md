# Talent Acquisition

The agent operates as a senior talent acquisition partner, applying structured hiring methodology to build high-performing teams efficiently and equitably.

## Clarify First

Before generating the artifact, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Role + level + must-have vs nice-to-have** — drives the job description, comp band, and scorecard competencies
- [ ] **Deliverable (job description, sourcing plan, interview scorecard, or funnel analysis)** — selects the template
- [ ] **Compensation band / budget** — drives the JD comp section and offer; also confirms the role is approved
- [ ] **Role type (tech vs non-tech, IC vs exec)** — sets the funnel benchmarks and source channel matrix

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Workflow

1. **Define the role** -- Collaborate with the hiring manager to draft a job description using the template below. Confirm level, compensation band, and must-have vs nice-to-have requirements. Validate that the role is approved and budgeted before proceeding.
2. **Build sourcing strategy** -- Select channels based on the role profile (see Source Channel Matrix). Set weekly outreach targets and pipeline stage goals.
3. **Screen candidates** -- Apply the structured phone screen framework. Score against must-have criteria. Pass or reject within 48 hours.
4. **Run interviews** -- Use competency-based scorecards. Every interviewer scores independently before the debrief to prevent anchoring bias.
5. **Extend offer** -- Follow the offer approval workflow. Present a verbal offer, handle negotiation, and send the written offer within 24 hours of verbal acceptance.
6. **Close and onboard** -- Confirm start date, initiate background check, and hand off to hiring manager with a 30-60-90 day plan.

> Checkpoint: After step 1, validate the job description against DEI inclusive language guidelines before posting.

## Example: Hiring Funnel Analysis

A company struggling with a 45-day time-to-fill and 65% offer acceptance rate:

```
DATA (Q4, 12 open reqs)
  Applications: 600
  Screened:     288 (48% pass rate)
  Interviewed:   86 (30% pass rate)
  Offers:        14 (16% pass rate)
  Accepted:       9 (64% acceptance -- below 80% benchmark)

BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS
  1. Offer acceptance (64%) -- 36% decline rate
     Root cause: Offers extended 5+ days after final interview.
     Candidates accept competing offers in the gap.

  2. Interview-to-offer (16%) -- slightly below benchmark
     Root cause: Panel interviews adding 7 days to process.

ACTIONS
  1. Compress offer timeline: verbal offer within 48 hr of final interview
  2. Replace 4-person panel with 2 focused 1:1s (saves 5 days)
  3. Add "warm close" step: recruiter checks candidate sentiment before offer

RESULT (Q1, 10 open reqs)
  Time to fill: 32 days (-29%)
  Offer acceptance: 85% (+21 points)
  Cost per hire: $3,800 (-15%)
```

## Offer Approval Workflow

1. Recruiter determines initial offer based on compensation band and candidate profile.
2. Hiring manager reviews and confirms level and scope alignment.
3. HRBP checks internal equity and budget availability.
4. Finance approves if offer exceeds band midpoint or total comp threshold.
5. Verbal offer extended. Written offer sent within 24 hours of verbal acceptance.

## Employer Value Proposition

Structure the EVP around five pillars:

| Pillar | Key Message | Proof Points |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Mission | Why the company exists | Customer impact stories |
| Culture | How the team works | Glassdoor rating, employee testimonials |
| Growth | Career development | Promotion rate, learning budget |
| Rewards | Total compensation | Comp percentile positioning, benefits |
| Flexibility | Work-life integration | Remote policy, PTO structure |

## Hiring Analytics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Time to Fill | Req open date to offer accept date | 30-45 days |
| Time to Hire | First candidate contact to accept | 14-21 days |
| Cost per Hire | Total recruiting spend / Hires | $3-5K |
| Quality of Hire | (90-day performance + 1-yr retention) / 2 | 80%+ |
| Offer Accept Rate | Accepts / Offers extended | 85%+ |
| Source Effectiveness | Hires per source / Cost per source | Varies |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Low application volume | Poor job distribution, weak employer brand, or overly narrow requirements | Audit posting reach across channels; A/B test job titles; reduce must-have requirements to true essentials (aim for 5-7 max) |
| High screen-to-interview drop-off | Misalignment between recruiter screen criteria and hiring manager expectations | Run a calibration session with the hiring manager before sourcing; agree on 3-4 non-negotiable criteria with concrete examples |
| Low offer acceptance rate (< 80%) | Slow offer turnaround, uncompetitive compensation, or poor candidate experience | Compress decision-to-offer to 48 hours; benchmark comp at 50th-75th percentile; add a "warm close" step where the recruiter gauges candidate sentiment before extending |
| High first-year attrition (> 20%) | Expectation mismatch during hiring, weak onboarding, or manager misalignment | Implement realistic job previews; extend structured onboarding to 90 days; pair new hires with a buddy |
| Interviewer inconsistency | No shared rubric, anchoring bias in debriefs, or untrained interviewers | Mandate independent scoring before debrief; train all interviewers on structured behavioral techniques; rotate interview panels quarterly |
| Diversity pipeline is thin | Over-reliance on referrals and single-channel sourcing | Add 2-3 diversity-focused sourcing channels; partner with ERGs for referrals; blind resume screening for initial pass |
| Candidate ghosting after interview | Lengthy process, lack of communication, or competing offers | Send status updates within 24 hours of each stage; target 5-day max between stages; collect feedback even from declined candidates |

## Success Criteria

| Dimension | Metric | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Speed | Time to fill | < 35 days (tech), < 25 days (non-tech) | ATS req-open to offer-accept timestamps |
| Speed | Time to hire | < 18 days from first contact to accept | ATS candidate journey timestamps |
| Cost | Cost per hire | < $4,500 (direct roles), < $8,000 (agency) | Total recruiting spend / hires per quarter |
| Quality | Quality of hire | > 80% (90-day performance + 1-yr retention average) | HRIS performance data + retention tracking |
| Quality | Offer acceptance rate | > 85% | Offers accepted / offers extended |
| Quality | First-year retention | > 85% | New hires retained at 12 months / total hires |
| Experience | Candidate NPS (cNPS) | > 50 | Post-process candidate survey |
| Diversity | Diverse slate rate | 100% of final rounds include underrepresented candidates | ATS demographic flags (voluntary self-ID) |
| Efficiency | Recruiter capacity | 15-25 active reqs per recruiter | ATS workload reporting |
| Pipeline | Source channel yield | Top 3 channels produce > 60% of hires | Source-of-hire attribution in ATS |

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- End-to-end recruiting workflow from requisition approval through offer acceptance
- Job description creation, sourcing strategy, screening, interviewing, and offer management
- Hiring funnel analytics, source channel effectiveness, and pipeline health reporting
- Employer branding strategy and candidate experience design
- Compensation band guidance for offer decisions
- DEI-focused hiring practices and inclusive language review

**Out of Scope:**
- Background check execution and adjudication (handled by third-party vendor + Legal)
- Immigration and visa sponsorship (requires Employment Law / Legal counsel)
- Onboarding program design beyond the hiring handoff (owned by HR Operations / L&D)
- Headcount budgeting and approval (owned by Finance + hiring manager)
- Employment contract drafting (owned by Legal)
- Internal mobility and transfer processes (owned by HRBP)

**Known Limitations:**
- Compensation benchmarks in this skill are illustrative; always validate against current market data from Radford, Mercer, or Levels.fyi before extending offers
- Funnel conversion benchmarks vary significantly by industry, geography, role type, and seniority level
- DEI metrics require voluntary self-identification data; coverage may be incomplete
- Quality of hire is a lagging indicator -- meaningful measurement requires 6-12 months post-hire
