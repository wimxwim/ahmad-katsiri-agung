# Whistleblower Compliance Skill

## Overview

Production-ready whistleblower compliance toolkit for auditing existing reporting systems and drafting compliant policies. Covers EU Directive 2019/1937, US SOX Section 806, US Dodd-Frank, and UK Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Operates in two modes: Mode A (Assessment) runs an 8-phase, 56-checkpoint audit of existing systems; Mode B (Drafting) generates jurisdiction-specific reporting policies.

## Clarify First

Before generating output, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Mode: assess an existing system or draft a policy** — Mode A runs a 56-checkpoint audit with gap scoring; Mode B produces a policy skeleton — completely different artifacts
- [ ] **Jurisdiction** — EU, US, or UK — sets which regulation's requirements, thresholds, and timelines apply (EU 7-day ack / 3-month feedback vs SOX 180-day filing)
- [ ] **Headcount + org type** — EU thresholds differ (private 50+, public sector all); determines applicability and which sections are mandatory
- [ ] **Sector** — financial, healthcare, defense, nuclear, transport — triggers the Phase 8 sector-specific requirements

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the output.

## Tools

### 1. Compliance Checker (`scripts/whistleblower_compliance_checker.py`)

Assess an existing whistleblower system against regulatory requirements. Takes organizational parameters and outputs a compliance score with priority-classified gaps.

```bash
python scripts/whistleblower_compliance_checker.py \
  --jurisdiction EU --headcount 300 --sector financial \
  --channels internal,external --has-designated-person \
  --has-confidentiality --has-gdpr-measures --has-dissemination

python scripts/whistleblower_compliance_checker.py \
  --jurisdiction US --headcount 5000 --sector healthcare \
  --channels internal --json

python scripts/whistleblower_compliance_checker.py \
  --jurisdiction UK --headcount 50 --sector technology \
  --channels none
```

### 2. Policy Scaffolder (`scripts/whistleblower_policy_scaffolder.py`)

Generate a whistleblower policy skeleton pre-populated with required sections per regulatory framework.

```bash
python scripts/whistleblower_policy_scaffolder.py \
  --jurisdiction EU --org-type private --headcount 500 \
  --org-name "Acme Corp"

python scripts/whistleblower_policy_scaffolder.py \
  --jurisdiction US --org-type public --headcount 10000 \
  --org-name "MegaCorp Inc" --json

python scripts/whistleblower_policy_scaffolder.py \
  --jurisdiction UK --org-type nonprofit --headcount 100 \
  --org-name "CharityOrg" --output policy-draft.md
```

## Reference Guides

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `references/regulatory_framework.md` | Multi-jurisdiction whistleblower regulations, comparison matrix |
| `references/assessment_checklist.md` | 8-phase, 56-checkpoint assessment with priority classifications |

## Workflows

### Mode A: Assessment Workflow

1. **Gather Parameters** -- Collect jurisdiction, headcount, sector, and system description
2. **Run Compliance Checker** -- Execute `whistleblower_compliance_checker.py` with parameters
3. **Review Gaps** -- Prioritize CRITICAL gaps first, then IMPORTANT, then IMPROVEMENT
4. **Cross-Reference Checklist** -- Walk through `assessment_checklist.md` for manual verification
5. **Generate Remediation Plan** -- Address gaps by priority, set deadlines per regulatory timelines

### Mode B: Drafting Workflow

1. **Determine Jurisdiction** -- Identify applicable regulations based on headquarters and operations
2. **Generate Scaffold** -- Run `whistleblower_policy_scaffolder.py` with organization details
3. **Customize Sections** -- Replace placeholders with organization-specific information
4. **Legal Review** -- Route draft through legal counsel for jurisdiction-specific validation
5. **Approval & Publication** -- Obtain board/management approval and disseminate to all personnel

### 8-Phase Assessment Framework

| Phase | Focus | Checkpoints |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1. Applicability | Regulatory scope determination | 3 |
| 2. Reception Channel | Reporting channel adequacy | 5 |
| 3. Designated Persons | Personnel and independence | 7 |
| 4. Verification/Processing | Investigation procedures | 8 |
| 5. Confidentiality | Identity and data protection | 9 |
| 6. Dissemination/Information | Awareness and accessibility | 10 |
| 7. Data Protection/GDPR | Privacy compliance | 12 |
| 8. Sector-Specific | Industry requirements | 6 |
| **Total** | | **60** |

### Three Reporting Channels

| Channel | When Used | Key Requirements |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Internal | First preference; report to organization | Acknowledge within 7 days; feedback within 3 months |
| External (Regulatory) | When internal fails or is inappropriate | Report to competent authority; same protections apply |
| Public Disclosure | Last resort; imminent danger or retaliation | Protected only if internal/external channels exhausted |

### Whistleblower Protections

| Protection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Civil immunity | No liability for breach of confidentiality obligations |
| Criminal immunity | No criminal liability for acquiring reported information |
| Prohibited retaliation | Dismissal, demotion, harassment, blacklisting, discrimination |
| Burden of proof reversal | Employer must prove action was not retaliatory |
| Interim relief | Provisional protection during investigation |
| Legal aid access | Access to legal counsel and support |

### Priority Classification

| Priority | Definition | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Legal non-compliance; immediate regulatory risk | No reporting channel exists; no confidentiality measures |
| IMPORTANT | Significant gap reducing system effectiveness | Acknowledgment timeline exceeds 7 days; no designated person |
| IMPROVEMENT | Enhancement opportunity; not currently non-compliant | Training frequency below best practice; limited channel types |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Checker reports all CRITICAL | No system parameters provided | Provide accurate `--channels`, `--has-designated-person`, and other flags |
| Wrong jurisdiction requirements | Multi-jurisdiction entity using single jurisdiction | Run checker separately per jurisdiction; use strictest requirements |
| Policy scaffold missing sections | Jurisdiction flag incorrect | Verify `--jurisdiction` matches EU, US, or UK |
| Headcount threshold confusion | EU directive has different thresholds by entity type | Private sector: 50+ employees; public sector: all municipalities |
| Sector-specific gaps not flagged | Generic sector value used | Use specific sector: `financial`, `healthcare`, `defense`, `nuclear` |
| GDPR checks fail for US entity | US entities may still need GDPR compliance | If processing EU citizen data, add `--has-gdpr-measures` |
| Timeline requirements unclear | Different jurisdictions have different timelines | EU: 7-day ack, 3-month feedback; SOX: 180-day filing deadline |
| Policy output too generic | Minimal parameters provided | Add `--org-name`, `--org-type`, and `--headcount` for specificity |

## Success Criteria

- **Compliance Coverage**: Assessment covers 100% of applicable regulatory requirements for specified jurisdiction
- **Gap Identification**: All CRITICAL and IMPORTANT gaps identified with clear remediation guidance
- **Policy Completeness**: Generated policies include all mandatory sections per applicable regulation
- **Timeline Compliance**: Policies reflect correct acknowledgment (7 days) and feedback (3 months) timelines
- **Audit Readiness**: Assessment output sufficient for regulatory audit preparation and evidence gathering

## Scope & Limitations

**This skill covers:**
- Compliance assessment against EU Directive 2019/1937, US SOX/Dodd-Frank, UK PIDA
- Policy scaffolding with jurisdiction-specific mandatory sections
- Gap analysis with priority classification and remediation guidance
- Multi-sector considerations (financial, healthcare, defense, nuclear, transport)

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Actual whistleblower case management or investigation procedures
- Legal advice or attorney-client privileged analysis
- Real-time regulatory monitoring or automatic updates when laws change
- Whistleblower hotline software implementation or vendor selection
- Cross-border reporting coordination between multiple regulators

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Copy-pasting policy from another jurisdiction | Regulations differ materially; EU requires 7-day ack, SOX has 180-day filing | Run scaffolder with correct jurisdiction; customize per local requirements |
| Treating all gaps as equal priority | Wastes resources on improvements while CRITICAL gaps remain | Address CRITICAL first, IMPORTANT second, IMPROVEMENT last |
| Single assessment for multi-jurisdiction org | Each jurisdiction has unique requirements and thresholds | Run separate assessments per jurisdiction; merge into unified policy |
| Skipping sector-specific phase | Regulated sectors (financial, healthcare) have additional requirements | Always complete Phase 8 for regulated industries |
| No periodic reassessment | Regulations evolve; transposition deadlines pass | Schedule annual reassessment; monitor legislative changes |
