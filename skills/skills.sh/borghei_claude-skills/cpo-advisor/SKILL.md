## The CPO Owns Three Things

Everything else is delegation.

| Ownership | What It Means | Key Question |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Portfolio | Which products exist, which get investment, which get killed | "If we could only fund 2 of our 4 products, which 2?" |
| Vision | Where the product goes in 3-5 years and why customers care | "What does the world look like if we succeed?" |
| Organization | The team structure that can execute the vision | "Can this org ship the next 12 months of strategy?" |

---

## Product-Market Fit Assessment

### PMF Scoring Matrix

| Dimension | Weight | Score 1-3 (Weak) | Score 4-6 (Emerging) | Score 7-10 (Strong) |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Retention | 30% | D30 < 15% (consumer) or < 40% (B2B) | D30 15-30% / 40-60% | D30 > 30% / > 60% |
| Engagement | 25% | DAU/MAU < 15% | DAU/MAU 15-35% | DAU/MAU > 35% |
| Satisfaction | 25% | Sean Ellis < 25% "very disappointed" | 25-40% | > 40% |
| Growth | 20% | No organic growth | Some organic, mostly paid | > 50% organic |

### PMF Decision Tree

```
START: "Do we have PMF?"
  |
  v
[Check retention curve shape]
  |
  +-- Declining to zero --> NO PMF. Stop building. Talk to users.
  |
  +-- Declining but flattening --> EMERGING. Find the segment where it's flat.
  |
  +-- Flat or smiling --> [Check Sean Ellis score]
                          |
                          +-- < 25% "very disappointed" --> Weak PMF. Product is nice, not essential.
                          |
                          +-- 25-40% --> Moderate PMF. Find and double down on power users.
                          |
                          +-- > 40% --> [Check organic growth]
                                        |
                                        +-- < 30% organic --> PMF exists but distribution is weak.
                                        +-- > 30% organic --> STRONG PMF. Scale.
```

### Post-PMF Traps

| Trap | Description | Prevention |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Feature creep | Adding features for new segments dilutes core value | Maintain a "jobs" focus, not feature focus |
| Premature scaling | Scaling sales/marketing before retention proves sustainable | Prove 3+ cohorts retain before scaling spend |
| Metric vanity | Celebrating signups while ignoring retention | North star must be a retention/engagement metric |
| Founder departure from product | CEO stops talking to customers post-PMF | Monthly customer conversations are permanent |
| Platform too early | Building platform capabilities before core is solid | Platform only after 3+ products need shared infra |

---

## Portfolio Management

### Investment Posture Framework

Every product gets exactly one posture. "Wait and see" is a decision to lose share.

| Posture | Signal | Resource Allocation | Review Cadence |
|---------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Invest** | High growth, strong/improving retention, clear PMF | Full team, aggressive roadmap, dedicated marketing | Monthly |
| **Maintain** | Stable revenue, slow growth, good margins | Bug fixes, incremental improvement, minimal new features | Quarterly |
| **Harvest** | Declining growth, still profitable, no recovery path | Minimal investment, maximize cash extraction | Quarterly |
| **Kill** | Declining, negative margins, no recovery evidence | Set sunset date, migration plan, team reallocation | Immediate |

### Portfolio Health Scorecard

| Metric | Healthy | Unhealthy |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| % revenue from "Invest" products | > 60% | < 40% |
| % engineering on "Kill" candidates | < 10% | > 20% |
| Number of products without clear posture | 0 | > 1 |
| Portfolio D30 retention (weighted) | Improving QoQ | Declining QoQ |
| # of "question marks" > 2 quarters | 0 | > 2 |

### Portfolio Review Process

```
Quarterly Portfolio Review (Half-day workshop)

Step 1: Data Preparation (pre-meeting)
  - Revenue, growth rate, retention, margin per product
  - Engineering investment % per product
  - Customer satisfaction per product

Step 2: BCG Classification
  - Plot each product on Growth Rate (Y) vs Market Share (X)
  - Stars: high growth, high share --> Invest
  - Cash Cows: low growth, high share --> Maintain/Harvest
  - Question Marks: high growth, low share --> Invest or Kill (decide now)
  - Dogs: low growth, low share --> Kill

Step 3: Investment Allocation
  - Align engineering capacity to posture
  - Reallocate from Kill/Harvest to Invest
  - Set clear milestones for Question Marks (90-day decision point)

Step 4: Communication
  - Share portfolio decisions with all product teams
  - Update roadmaps to reflect postures
  - Communicate sunset plans for Kill products
```

## North Star Metric Framework

### Selection Criteria

The north star metric must satisfy ALL of these:

| Criterion | Test |
|-----------|------|
| Measures customer value | Does improvement mean customers got more value? |
| Leading indicator | Does it predict future revenue? |
| Actionable | Can product teams influence it? |
| Single number | Can you state it as one metric? |
| Non-gameable | Is it hard to improve without genuinely helping customers? |

### North Star by Business Model

| Model | North Star | Why It Works |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| B2B SaaS | Weekly active accounts using core feature | Combines adoption + engagement + stickiness |
| Consumer social | Daily content creators | Creators drive consumer engagement |
| Marketplace | Successful transactions per week | Both sides active = healthy marketplace |
| PLG | Accounts reaching activation within 14 days | Activation predicts retention |
| Data/Analytics | Queries per active user per week | Usage intensity = value received |
| Fintech | Monthly active transactors | Transaction activity = core value |
| E-commerce | Repeat purchase rate (90-day) | Retention is everything in commerce |

### Metrics Hierarchy

```
North Star Metric (1, owned by CPO)
  |
  +-- Leading Indicator 1 (owned by PM Team A)
  |     e.g., Activation rate within 7 days
  |
  +-- Leading Indicator 2 (owned by PM Team B)
  |     e.g., Feature X adoption rate
  |
  +-- Leading Indicator 3 (owned by PM Team C)
  |     e.g., D7 retention rate
  |
  +-- Guard Rail Metrics (owned by CPO)
        e.g., NPS, support ticket volume, revenue per user
```

## Product Organization Design

### Team Topology Selection

| Topology | When to Use | Optimal Size | Communication |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Stream-aligned | Default. Teams own end-to-end customer journey. | 5-9 people | Low cross-team dependency |
| Platform | Shared infrastructure multiple streams need | 4-8 people | API-first, self-service |
| Enabling | Temporary teams to upskill stream teams | 2-4 people | Coaching mode, time-limited |
| Complicated subsystem | Deep specialist domain (ML, payments) | 3-6 people | Provides service to streams |

### Product Team Ratios

| Company Size | PM : Engineers | PM : Designer | Total Product Team |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 10-30 | 1:4-6 | 1:1 | 1 PM, 1 Designer, 4-6 Eng |
| 30-80 | 1:5-8 | 1:1-2 | 2-4 PMs, 2-3 Designers |
| 80-200 | 1:6-10 | 1:1-2 | 5-10 PMs, 4-6 Designers |
| 200+ | 1:8-12 | 1:2 | 10+ PMs, 8+ Designers |

### The Product Trio

Every product team should operate as a trio: PM + Designer + Tech Lead.

| Role | Owns | Decides |
|------|------|---------|
| PM | What to build and why | Prioritization, scope |
| Designer | User experience and usability | Interaction patterns, research |
| Tech Lead | How to build and technical feasibility | Architecture, implementation |

**Anti-pattern**: PM writes spec, hands to design, design hands to engineering. This is waterfall with agile labels.

## CPO Dashboard

| Category | Metric | Frequency | Target |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Growth | North star metric | Weekly | Improving MoM |
| Retention | D30 / D90 retention by cohort | Weekly | Flattening or improving |
| Acquisition | New activations | Weekly | Per plan |
| Activation | Time to first value | Weekly | Decreasing |
| Engagement | DAU/MAU ratio | Weekly | > 30% (B2B) / > 20% (consumer) |
| Satisfaction | NPS trend | Monthly | > 40 |
| Portfolio | Revenue per product | Monthly | Aligned to posture |
| Portfolio | Engineering investment % per product | Monthly | Aligned to posture |
| Quality | Support tickets per 1K users | Monthly | Decreasing |
| Moat | Feature adoption depth | Monthly | Increasing |

---

## Red Flags

- Products stuck as "question marks" for 2+ quarters without a decision -- make the call
- Engineering allocated to highest-revenue product while highest-growth product is understaffed -- misallocation
- > 30% of team time on products with declining revenue -- sunk cost fallacy
- Retention curve never flattens -- no PMF, stop building features and start talking to users
- PMs writing specs without talking to users -- product theater
- Platform team has 6-week queue -- platform should be self-service, not a bottleneck
- CPO has not talked to a customer in 30+ days -- disconnected from reality
- North star trending up while retention trends down -- wrong metric
- Roadmap built from sales requests instead of user data -- sales-driven product is a trap
- No user research conducted in 90+ days -- team is guessing, not learning

---

## Integration with C-Suite

| When... | CPO Works With... | To... |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Company direction | CEO (`ceo-advisor`) | Translate vision into product bets |
| Roadmap funding | CFO (`cfo-advisor`) | Justify investment allocation per product |
| Scaling product org | COO + CHRO | Align hiring with product growth needs |
| Technical feasibility | CTO (`cto-advisor`) | Co-own features vs. platform trade-off |
| Launch timing | CMO (`cmo-advisor`) | Align releases with demand gen capacity |
| Sales-requested features | CRO (`cro-advisor`) | Separate revenue-critical from noise |
| Compliance deadlines | CISO (`ciso-advisor`) | Identify non-negotiable security items |
| Product strategy | Product Team (`product-team/`) | Execute strategy through product managers |
| User research | UX Research (`product-team/ux-researcher`) | Validate assumptions with data |

---

## Proactive Triggers

- Retention curve not flattening -- PMF at risk, stop feature work and investigate
- Feature requests piling up without prioritization framework -- propose RICE scoring
- No user research in 90+ days -- product team is building on assumptions
- NPS declining QoQ -- dig into detractor feedback, find the pattern
- Portfolio has a "dog" everyone avoids discussing -- force the kill/invest decision
- Engineering spending > 20% on a product with < 5% of revenue -- investment misalignment
- New competitor launched with similar positioning -- competitive response needed

---

## Output Artifacts

| Request | Deliverable |
|---------|-------------|
| "Do we have PMF?" | PMF scorecard across 4 dimensions with cohort data |
| "Prioritize our roadmap" | Scored backlog with framework (RICE/ICE), stack-ranked |

## Tool Reference

### 1. product_portfolio_analyzer.py

Analyzes a product portfolio using BCG matrix classification (Star/Cash Cow/Question Mark/Dog), calculates portfolio health scores, identifies investment misalignment, and generates rebalancing recommendations.

```bash
python scripts/product_portfolio_analyzer.py --input portfolio.json --json
python scripts/product_portfolio_analyzer.py --input portfolio.json
```

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--input` | required | Path to JSON file with products (revenue, growth rate, market share, engineering investment %, retention) |
| `--json` | optional | Output in JSON format instead of human-readable text |

### 2. feature_prioritizer.py

Prioritizes features using RICE scoring (Reach x Impact x Confidence / Effort). Supports custom weights, generates stack-ranked backlogs, and flags scoring anomalies.

```bash
python scripts/feature_prioritizer.py --input features.json --json
python scripts/feature_prioritizer.py --input features.json --method rice
```

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--input` | required | Path to JSON file with features (reach, impact, confidence, effort, optional category) |
| `--method` | optional | Scoring method: `rice` (default), `ice`, or `weighted` |
| `--json` | optional | Output in JSON format instead of human-readable text |

### 3. product_health_scorer.py

Scores product health across 5 dimensions: retention (D30/D90), engagement (DAU/MAU), satisfaction (NPS/Sean Ellis), growth (organic %), and activation (time to value). Generates PMF assessment and trend analysis.

```bash
python scripts/product_health_scorer.py --input product_data.json --json
python scripts/product_health_scorer.py --input product_data.json
```

| Flag | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--input` | required | Path to JSON file with product metrics across retention, engagement, satisfaction, growth, and activation |
| `--json` | optional | Output in JSON format instead of human-readable text |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Products stuck as "question marks" for 2+ quarters | No decision framework or leadership avoidance | Force invest-or-kill decision at next portfolio review; set 90-day milestones with automatic kill trigger |
| Engineering allocated to highest-revenue product while highest-growth product starves | Investment posture not aligned to growth potential | Run portfolio analyzer to quantify misalignment; reallocate using BCG classification |
| RICE scores gamed by PMs inflating reach or impact | No calibration process or shared scoring standards | Require evidence for each score dimension; run quarterly calibration sessions across PM teams |
| North star metric trending up while retention trends down | Wrong north star metric selected or metric is gameable | Re-evaluate north star against the 5 selection criteria; add retention as a guard rail metric |
| Roadmap built from sales requests instead of user data | No structured intake process or CPO not filtering | Implement feature request triage; require user research evidence before roadmap inclusion |
| Platform team has 6-week queue blocking stream teams | Platform not self-service; too many dependencies | Redesign platform for self-service APIs; add enabling team to unblock highest-priority streams |
| No user research conducted in 90+ days | Research not embedded in team workflow or understaffed | Embed researcher in product trio; set minimum research cadence (2 studies per quarter minimum) |

---

## Success Criteria

- Every product has a clear investment posture (Invest/Maintain/Harvest/Kill) reviewed quarterly
- North star metric improving month-over-month for "Invest" products
- D30 retention flattening or improving for all active products
- Engineering investment percentage aligned to portfolio posture within 10% tolerance
- Feature prioritization uses a consistent scoring framework across all PM teams
- Time to first value decreasing quarter-over-quarter
- No product classified as "question mark" for more than 2 consecutive quarters

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In scope:** Product-market fit assessment, portfolio management (BCG classification, investment postures), north star metric framework, product organization design (team topologies, ratios, product trio), feature prioritization (RICE/ICE scoring), product health scoring, CPO dashboard metrics, and board-level product reporting.

**Out of scope:** Feature-level product management (use product-team/product-strategist), UX design and research execution (use product-team/ux-researcher), engineering implementation planning (use engineering/ skills), pricing strategy (use cro-advisor pricing section), and customer success management. Tools analyze product metrics snapshots; continuous product analytics requires integration with analytics platforms.

**Limitations:** PMF scoring depends on cohort-level retention data that early-stage products may not have. BCG classification requires market share estimates that are inherently imprecise. RICE scoring is subjective; quality depends on calibration rigor. Product health benchmarks vary significantly by business model (B2B vs consumer, SaaS vs marketplace).

---

## Integration Points

- **ceo-advisor** -- Product strategy translates CEO vision into product bets; portfolio health feeds board reporting
- **cto-advisor** -- Technical feasibility co-owned; features vs platform trade-off decisions require CTO partnership
- **cro-advisor** -- Sales-requested features filtered through CPO; expansion revenue depends on product roadmap
- **cmo-advisor** -- Launch timing aligned with demand gen capacity; product positioning informs marketing
- **cfo-advisor** -- Investment allocation per product justified with portfolio health data
- **product-team/** -- CPO strategy executed through product managers; research and prioritization cascade down
