## Risk Quantification Framework

Every security investment must be justified in business terms. "We need better security" is not a business case. "$800K expected annual loss from this unmitigated risk" is.

### Core Formula

```
ALE = SLE x ARO

ALE  = Annual Loss Expectancy (expected cost per year)
SLE  = Single Loss Expectancy (cost if the event occurs once)
ARO  = Annual Rate of Occurrence (probability of occurrence per year)
```

### Risk Register Template

| Risk ID | Threat | Asset | SLE | ARO | ALE | Mitigation Cost | ROI | Priority |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|-----|----------|
| R-001 | Data breach (customer PII) | Customer database | $2.5M | 0.15 | $375K | $120K/yr | 3.1x | Critical |
| R-002 | Ransomware | Production systems | $1.8M | 0.10 | $180K | $80K/yr | 2.3x | High |
| R-003 | Insider threat | Source code | $500K | 0.05 | $25K | $40K/yr | 0.6x | Medium |
| R-004 | DDoS | Customer-facing app | $200K | 0.20 | $40K | $30K/yr | 1.3x | Medium |
| R-005 | Third-party breach | Vendor with PII access | $1.2M | 0.08 | $96K | $25K/yr | 3.8x | High |

### Risk Prioritization Decision Tree

```
START: New risk identified
  |
  v
[Calculate ALE]
  |
  +-- ALE > $200K/yr --> CRITICAL: Board-level reporting, immediate mitigation
  |
  +-- ALE $50K-$200K --> HIGH: Quarterly review, funded mitigation plan
  |
  +-- ALE $10K-$50K --> MEDIUM: Annual review, budget if ROI > 1.5x
  |
  +-- ALE < $10K --> LOW: Accept risk, document decision, monitor
```

### SLE Component Breakdown

| Cost Component | Description | Typical Range |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Direct costs | Forensics, remediation, legal | $100K-$500K |
| Regulatory fines | GDPR: up to 4% revenue; HIPAA: $100-$50K per record | Varies widely |
| Notification costs | $5-$50 per affected individual | Scale with records |
| Business interruption | Lost revenue during downtime | Hours x hourly revenue |
| Reputation damage | Customer churn, brand impact | 2-5% annual revenue |
| Legal liability | Lawsuits, settlements | $50K-$5M+ |

---

## Compliance Roadmap

### Sequencing for Maximum Business Value

```
Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
  Basic hygiene: MFA, endpoint protection, access controls, backups
  Cost: $20-50K   Impact: Blocks 80% of common attacks

Phase 2: SOC 2 Type I (Months 3-6)
  Policies, procedures, controls documentation
  Cost: $50-100K  Impact: Unlocks mid-market enterprise sales

Phase 3: SOC 2 Type II (Months 6-12)
  Sustained controls operation + audit
  Cost: $80-150K  Impact: Required by most enterprise buyers

Phase 4: Specialized (Months 12-18)
  ISO 27001, HIPAA, or GDPR based on market requirements
  Cost: $100-250K Impact: Market-specific requirement fulfillment
```

### Compliance Framework Comparison

| Framework | Timeline | Cost | Best For | Customer Requirement |
|-----------|----------|------|----------|---------------------|
| SOC 2 Type I | 3-6 months | $50-100K | B2B SaaS selling to US companies | Most common ask |
| SOC 2 Type II | 6-12 months | $80-150K | Sustained enterprise sales | Required for large deals |
| ISO 27001 | 9-15 months | $100-200K | European market, global companies | EU enterprise standard |
| HIPAA | 6-12 months | $80-200K | Healthcare data handling | Healthcare vertical |
| GDPR | 3-6 months | $30-80K | Any company with EU users | Legal requirement |
| PCI DSS | 6-12 months | $100-300K | Payment card processing | Payment requirement |
| FedRAMP | 12-24 months | $500K-2M | US federal government sales | Government requirement |

### Framework Overlap Matrix

| Control Area | SOC 2 | ISO 27001 | HIPAA | GDPR |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-------|------|
| Access control | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Encryption | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Incident response | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Risk assessment | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Vendor management | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Data classification | Partial | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Physical security | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial |
| Business continuity | Yes | Yes | Partial | Partial |
| Privacy by design | No | Partial | Partial | Yes |

**Key insight**: SOC 2 + ISO 27001 share approximately 70% of controls. Do SOC 2 first, then extend to ISO 27001 with ~30% incremental effort.

## Security Architecture Strategy

### Zero Trust Maturity Model

| Level | Description | Key Controls | Timeline |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 0: Ad-hoc | No formal security architecture | -- | Current state for most startups |
| 1: Identity | MFA everywhere, SSO, role-based access | IAM + MFA + SSO | Months 1-3 |
| 2: Network | Network segmentation, VPN/ZTNA | Micro-segmentation, ZTNA | Months 3-6 |
| 3: Data | Data classification, encryption at rest/transit, DLP | Encryption + classification | Months 6-12 |
| 4: Monitoring | SIEM, logging, anomaly detection | Centralized logging + alerting | Months 9-15 |
| 5: Automated | Automated response, continuous verification | SOAR + automated remediation | Months 12-24 |

### Security Architecture Decision Tree

```
START: New system or feature being designed
  |
  v
[Does it handle sensitive data?]
  |
  +-- YES --> [What classification level?]
  |            |
  |            +-- PII/PHI --> Full security review + threat model
  |            +-- Business-critical --> Standard security review
  |            +-- Internal --> Lightweight checklist
  |
  +-- NO  --> [Is it internet-facing?]
              |
              +-- YES --> Standard security review + pen test
              +-- NO  --> Security checklist only
```

### Defense-in-Depth Layers

| Layer | Controls | Investment Priority |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Identity | MFA, SSO, RBAC, privileged access management | 1st (highest ROI) |
| Endpoint | EDR, device management, patching | 2nd |
| Network | Segmentation, ZTNA, firewall, IDS/IPS | 3rd |
| Application | SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, WAF | 4th |
| Data | Encryption, DLP, classification, backup | 5th |
| Monitoring | SIEM, logging, alerting, threat detection | 6th |

---

## Incident Response Protocol

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Notification |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| P0: Critical | Active breach, data exfiltration, ransomware | Immediate (< 15 min) | CEO + Legal + Board |
| P1: High | Vulnerability being exploited, service down | < 1 hour | CTO + CEO |
| P2: Medium | Vulnerability discovered, suspicious activity | < 4 hours | CTO + Security team |
| P3: Low | Policy violation, minor misconfiguration | < 24 hours | Security team only |

### Incident Response Workflow

```
DETECT --> CONTAIN --> ERADICATE --> RECOVER --> LEARN

Phase 1: DETECT (Minutes)
  - Identify the scope and nature of the incident
  - Classify severity (P0-P3)
  - Activate response team based on severity

Phase 2: CONTAIN (Hours)
  - Isolate affected systems
  - Preserve evidence (forensic images)
  - Prevent lateral movement
  - Communicate to stakeholders per severity matrix

Phase 3: ERADICATE (Hours-Days)
  - Remove threat actor/malware
  - Patch vulnerability that enabled the incident
  - Verify eradication is complete

Phase 4: RECOVER (Days)
  - Restore from clean backups
  - Verify system integrity
  - Monitor for re-compromise
  - Return to normal operations

Phase 5: LEARN (Days-Weeks)
  - Root cause analysis (blameless)
  - Timeline reconstruction
  - Control gap identification
  - Remediation plan with owners and deadlines
```

### Regulatory Notification Timelines

| Regulation | Notification Deadline | To Whom |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| GDPR | 72 hours | Supervisory authority + affected individuals |
| HIPAA | 60 days | HHS + affected individuals (+ media if > 500) |
| State breach laws (US) | 30-90 days (varies) | State AG + affected individuals |
| SEC (public companies) | 4 business days | SEC + public disclosure |
| PCI DSS | Immediately | Card brands + acquiring bank |

---

## Vendor Security Assessment

### Vendor Tiering

| Tier | Data Access | Assessment Level | Frequency |
|------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Tier 1: Critical | PII, PHI, financial data, source code | Full security assessment + pen test review | Annual |
| Tier 2: Important | Business data, internal communications | Security questionnaire + SOC 2 review | Annual |
| Tier 3: Standard | No sensitive data access | Self-attestation + privacy policy review | Biennial |
| Tier 4: Minimal | No data access, no system integration | Contract review only | At contract renewal |

### Vendor Assessment Checklist (Tier 1)

| Domain | Key Questions | Pass/Fail Criteria |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Compliance | SOC 2 Type II or ISO 27001? | Must have at least one |
| Encryption | Data encrypted at rest and in transit? | AES-256 + TLS 1.2+ |
| Access | MFA enforced? RBAC implemented? | Both required |
| Incident response | Documented IR plan? Notification timeline? | Must have plan + 24hr notification |
| Business continuity | DR plan tested? RTO/RPO defined? | Must be tested within 12 months |
| Data handling | Data classification? Retention policy? | Must have both |
| Subprocessors | Who else handles our data? | Must disclose all |

## Security Metrics Dashboard

### Board-Level Metrics (Quarterly)

| Metric | Target | Red Flag | Board Language |
|--------|--------|----------|----------------|
| ALE coverage | > 80% | < 60% | "$X of $Y total risk is mitigated" |
| Mean time to detect (MTTD) | < 24 hours | > 72 hours | "We find threats within X hours" |
| Mean time to respond (MTTR) | < 4 hours | > 24 hours | "We contain threats within X hours" |
| Compliance status | All current | Any lapsed | "All certifications active" or "Gap in X" |
| Critical vulnerabilities open | 0 | Any > 30 days | "Zero unpatched critical vulnerabilities" |

### Operational Metrics (Monthly)

| Metric | Target | Action Trigger |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Phishing click rate | < 5% | > 10% = mandatory re-training |
| Critical patches within SLA | 100% | < 95% = process review |
| Privileged accounts reviewed | 100% quarterly | Any unreviewed = immediate review |
| Tier 1 vendors assessed | 100% annually | Any lapsed = assessment needed |
| Security training completion | > 95% | < 90% = escalate to managers |

---

## Security Budget Framework

### Budget as Percentage of Revenue/IT Spend

| Company Stage | Security Budget (% of Revenue) | Security Budget (% of IT) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Seed/Series A | 2-4% | 8-12% |
| Series B | 3-5% | 10-15% |
| Series C+ | 4-8% | 12-18% |
| Enterprise | 5-10% | 15-20% |

### Budget Allocation by Category

| Category | % of Security Budget | Examples |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| People | 40-50% | Security team salaries, training |
| Tools | 25-35% | SIEM, EDR, IAM, vulnerability scanner |
| Compliance | 10-15% | Auditors, certifications, legal |
| Testing | 5-10% | Pen testing, red team, bug bounty |
| Incident response | 5% | Retainer, insurance, forensics |

### Budget Justification Formula

For each security investment:

```
Investment ROI = (ALE_before - ALE_after) / Investment_cost

If ROI > 1.5x --> Strong business case, approve
If ROI 1.0-1.5x --> Moderate case, consider alternatives
If ROI < 1.0x --> Weak case, re-evaluate or accept the risk
```

---

## Red Flags

- Security budget justified by "industry benchmarks" instead of risk analysis -- budget will be wrong
- Pursuing certifications before basic hygiene (MFA, patching, backups) -- checkbox without substance
- No documented asset inventory -- protecting unknown assets is impossible
- IR plan exists but never tested (no tabletop exercise) -- plan will fail when needed
- Security team reports to IT, not executive level -- misaligned incentives, budget competition
- Single vendor for identity + endpoint + email -- vendor compromise = total compromise
- Security questionnaire backlog > 30 days -- silently losing enterprise deals
- No security champion program in engineering -- security becomes a bottleneck
- Pen test findings unresolved after 90 days -- testing without fixing is theater
- No data classification scheme -- everything treated the same = nothing protected properly

---

## Integration with C-Suite

| When... | CISO Works With... | To... |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Enterprise sales blocked | CRO (`cro-advisor`) | Complete security questionnaires, unblock deals |
| New product features | CTO + CPO (`cto-advisor`, `cpo-advisor`) | Threat modeling, security review |
| Compliance budget | CFO (`cfo-advisor`) | Size program against quantified risk exposure |
| Vendor contracts | COO (`coo-advisor`) | Security SLAs, right-to-audit clauses |
| M&A due diligence | CEO + CFO | Target security posture assessment |
| Incident occurs | CEO + Legal | Response coordination, regulatory notification |
| Board reporting | CEO (`ceo-advisor`) | Translate risk into business language |
| Hiring security team | CHRO (`chro-advisor`) | Compensation, leveling, recruiting |

---

## Proactive Triggers

- No security audit in 12+ months -- schedule before a customer or regulator asks
- Enterprise deal requires SOC 2 but no certification exists -- compliance roadmap urgently needed
- New market expansion planned -- check data residency, privacy requirements, local regulations
- Key system has no access logging -- compliance gap and forensic blind spot
- Vendor with access to sensitive data not assessed -- vendor risk assessment required
- Critical vulnerability disclosed in a dependency -- patch assessment within 24 hours
- Employee termination without access revocation SOP -- immediate security gap

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Security budget justified by "industry benchmarks" not risk data | No risk quantification framework in place | Implement ALE-based risk register; justify every dollar against quantified risk reduction |
| Pursuing SOC 2 before basic hygiene (MFA, backups) | Checkbox compliance without substance | Phase 1 foundation first: MFA, endpoint protection, backups; then pursue certifications |
| Pen test findings unresolved after 90 days | Testing without fixing is theater | Set SLA: critical 7 days, high 30 days, medium 90 days; track in risk register |
| Security team reports to IT, not executive level | Misaligned incentives and budget competition | CISO should report to CEO or COO; separate budget from IT |
| Enterprise deals blocked by security questionnaires | No SOC 2 or questionnaire response backlog > 30 days | Prioritize SOC 2 Type I; create questionnaire response library; assign dedicated owner |
| Zero Trust initiative stalled at identity layer | Trying to implement all pillars simultaneously | Follow maturity model: Identity first (months 1-3), then Network, then Data |

---

## Success Criteria

- Security posture score above 70/100 on NIST CSF assessment (measured annually via security_posture_scorer.py)
- ALE coverage above 80% -- quantified risk exposure has funded mitigations (tracked in risk register)
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) under 24 hours for all severity levels
- Mean time to respond (MTTR) under 4 hours for P0/P1 incidents
- Zero critical vulnerabilities open longer than 7 days (measured weekly)
- SOC 2 Type II certification maintained current with zero control exceptions
- Phishing click rate below 5% across quarterly simulation campaigns

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope**: Risk quantification (ALE/SLE/ARO), compliance roadmapping, Zero Trust maturity assessment, NIST CSF 2.0 scoring, incident response protocol, vendor security assessment, security budget justification, board-level security reporting.

**Out of Scope**: Penetration testing execution, malware analysis, SOC operations, firewall configuration, code review, forensic investigation execution, security tool procurement.

**Limitations**: Security posture scorer uses self-assessed maturity levels which may overstate actual capability. Risk register ALE calculations are estimates based on industry data -- actual losses vary significantly. Compliance tracker measures control implementation, not control effectiveness. Zero Trust scoring uses binary (implemented/not) which oversimplifies partial implementations.
