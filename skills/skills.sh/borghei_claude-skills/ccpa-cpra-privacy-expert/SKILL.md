## Clarify First

Before running the assessment, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Applicability** — whether the business meets a CCPA threshold ($25M revenue, 100K+ consumers/households, or 50%+ revenue from selling/sharing PI) (determines whether obligations apply at all)
- [ ] **Entity role** — business, service provider, contractor, or third party (determines which obligation set applies)
- [ ] **Assessment goal** — compliance readiness, data mapping, consumer-request handling, or privacy-policy review (selects the tool and workflow)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the assessment.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Initial CCPA/CPRA Compliance Assessment

```
Step 1: Determine applicability
        → Check $25M revenue, 100K+ consumers, 50%+ PI revenue thresholds
        → Review exemptions (HIPAA, GLBA, employment data)

Step 2: Generate compliance profile template
        → python scripts/ccpa_compliance_checker.py --template > profile.json
        → Fill in organizational details

Step 3: Run compliance assessment
        → python scripts/ccpa_compliance_checker.py --input profile.json

Step 4: Review scores and findings
        → Address critical gaps first (opt-out link, privacy policy)
        → Plan remediation by category

Step 5: Create data inventory
        → python scripts/ccpa_data_mapper.py --template > inventory.json
        → Document all PI categories collected
        → python scripts/ccpa_data_mapper.py --input inventory.json

Step 6: Develop implementation plan
        → See references/ccpa-implementation-playbook.md
```

### Workflow 2: Consumer Rights Request Handling

```
Step 1: Receive consumer request
        → Identify request type (Know, Delete, Opt-Out, Correct, Portability, Limit SPI)

Step 2: Acknowledge within 10 business days (confirm receipt)
        → Document request in tracking system

Step 3: Verify consumer identity
        → Match 2+ data points for standard requests
        → Match 3+ data points for sensitive data requests
        → No verification needed for opt-out requests

Step 4: Fulfill request within 45 calendar days
        → Extension: up to 45 additional days with notice
        → Search all systems using data inventory
        → python scripts/ccpa_data_mapper.py --input inventory.json

Step 5: Deliver response
        → Provide information in portable format if requested
        → Document completion and response

Step 6: Monitor compliance
        → Track response times and completion rates
        → Generate quarterly compliance reports
```

### Workflow 3: Privacy Policy Update Cycle

```
Step 1: Review current privacy policy against requirements
        → python scripts/ccpa_compliance_checker.py --input profile.json
        → Check privacy_policy category score

Step 2: Update data inventory
        → python scripts/ccpa_data_mapper.py --input inventory.json
        → Verify all PI categories are disclosed

Step 3: Verify required disclosures
        → Categories of PI collected (past 12 months)
        → Sources of PI
        → Business/commercial purposes
        → Categories of third parties
        → Consumer rights description
        → "Do Not Sell or Share" link
        → "Limit the Use of My Sensitive PI" link

Step 4: Update and publish
        → Annual update at minimum

| Children's data | Opt-in for under 16, parental for under 13 | Parental consent for under 16 (variable) |

### Infrastructure Privacy Controls

**Cookie Consent Management:**
- Implement cookie consent banner for non-essential cookies
- Honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) browser signals (legally required)
- Maintain cookie inventory with retention periods
- Categorize cookies: strictly necessary, functional, analytics, advertising

**Global Privacy Control (GPC):**
- Businesses must treat GPC signal as valid opt-out request (§1798.135)
- Technical implementation: detect `Sec-GPC: 1` header or `navigator.globalPrivacyControl`
- Apply opt-out to sale AND sharing of PI
- No re-authentication required for GPC

**Privacy by Design:**
- Data minimization: collect only PI necessary for disclosed purposes
- Purpose limitation: use PI only for purposes disclosed at collection
- Storage limitation: retain PI only as long as necessary
- Security by default: encrypt PI at rest and in transit

**Data Inventory and Mapping:**
- Maintain comprehensive PI inventory across all systems
- Map data flows: collection → processing → sharing → deletion
- Document retention schedules per PI category
- Track cross-border data transfers

**Automated Decision-Making:**
- Disclose use of automated decision-making technology
- Provide opt-out for profiling that produces legal or significant effects
- CPRA regulations may require access to logic of automated decisions

### Compliance Roadmap

**Month 1-2: Discovery and Assessment**
- Determine CCPA/CPRA applicability
- Conduct data inventory and mapping
- Gap analysis against requirements
- Assign compliance ownership

**Month 3-4: Implementation**
- Draft/update privacy policy
- Implement "Do Not Sell or Share" link
- Implement "Limit Use of SPI" link

- Draft service provider/contractor agreements

**Month 5-6: Operationalization**
- Train employees on privacy obligations
- Test consumer request workflows end-to-end
- Conduct initial risk assessment
- Plan annual cybersecurity audit
- Establish ongoing monitoring and metrics
- Document compliance program for regulatory defense

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Compliance score unexpectedly low despite privacy policy updates | Policy disclosures incomplete -- missing SPI categories, retention periods, or sale/sharing categories | Run `ccpa_compliance_checker.py --input profile.json` and review per-category scores; cross-reference privacy policy against the 17+ required disclosure elements |
| Data mapper flags cross-border transfers but organization operates only in US | Data inventory includes cloud services with non-US processing locations | Review data inventory entries for cloud provider data processing locations; document all sub-processor locations per service provider agreements |
| Consumer rights requests consistently exceed 45-day response deadline | Manual fulfillment process without tracking system or unclear ownership | Implement `ccpa_data_mapper.py` to map PI across all systems; deploy request tracking with automated deadline alerts; assign per-system data stewards |
| GPC signal detection not working | Application does not check `Sec-GPC: 1` header or `navigator.globalPrivacyControl` | Implement server-side header detection and client-side JavaScript check; test with browsers that support GPC (Firefox, Brave); log detection events |
| CPPA enforcement inquiry received | Potential compliance gap discovered during regulatory sweep or consumer complaint | Immediately run full compliance assessment; prioritize critical gaps (opt-out link, GPC, privacy policy); engage privacy counsel; document remediation timeline |
| Vendor contracts missing CCPA-required provisions | Service provider agreements predate CPRA amendments | Audit all vendor agreements against CCPA service provider/contractor requirements; update contracts to include certification, limited use, audit rights, and data deletion obligations |
| Risk assessment requirements unclear | New CPRA regulations (effective January 1, 2026) mandate risk assessments for six processing categories | Review processing activities against the six "significant risk" categories; document risk assessments per CPPA regulatory template; plan for April 2028 attestation deadline |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Overall compliance score of 80+ on initial assessment** -- indicating foundational CCPA/CPRA controls are in place, with per-category scores identifying targeted remediation areas
- **All consumer rights requests fulfilled within 45 calendar days** -- with 10-business-day acknowledgment, tracked through a request management system with automated deadline alerts
- **Privacy policy updated at least annually** -- with documented reviews quarterly, disclosing all 11 PI categories collected, sources, purposes, third-party sharing, and all seven consumer rights
- **GPC signal honored automatically** -- detected via `Sec-GPC: 1` header and `navigator.globalPrivacyControl`, applied to both sale and sharing of PI, with no re-authentication required
- **Complete data inventory maintained** -- all PI categories mapped to collection sources, business purposes, sharing recipients, and retention schedules using `ccpa_data_mapper.py`
- **Service provider and contractor agreements include all CCPA-required provisions** -- including certification of limited use, deletion obligations, audit rights, and sub-contractor chain documentation
- **Risk assessments completed for all applicable processing activities** -- covering the six CPRA significant-risk categories, with attestation readiness by the April 2028 deadline

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- CCPA/CPRA applicability determination (revenue, consumer count, PI revenue thresholds)
- Privacy policy compliance assessment against all required disclosures
- Consumer rights readiness validation (Know, Delete, Opt-Out, Correct, Portability, Limit SPI Use)
- Data inventory mapping across all 11 CCPA personal information categories
- Sensitive personal information identification per CPRA definitions
- Technical safeguard assessment (encryption, access controls, opt-out mechanisms)
- Service provider and contractor agreement requirements

**Out of Scope:**
- Legal advice or determination of exemption applicability (HIPAA, GLBA, FCRA, employment data) -- consult privacy counsel for exemption analysis
- Implementation of cookie consent management platforms or GPC signal handling code
- CCPA private right of action defense (data breach litigation) -- consult legal counsel
- Other state privacy laws (Virginia VCDPA, Colorado CPA, Connecticut CTDPA) beyond the comparison tables provided -- use jurisdiction-specific guidance
- Automated decision-making technology (ADMT) compliance under CPRA regulations effective January 2027 -- monitor CPPA rulemaking for final requirements

**Important Notes:**
- CPPA enforcement is escalating significantly in 2025-2026, with fines exceeding $1.3M in individual cases and joint multi-state enforcement sweeps targeting GPC non-compliance
- New CPRA regulations effective January 1, 2026 add risk assessment, cybersecurity audit, and updated compliance requirements -- plan implementation accordingly
