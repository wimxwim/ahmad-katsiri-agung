## When to Build vs When Not To

**Build a free tool when:**
- Search volume exists for "[topic] calculator/generator/checker" (> 500/month)
- No excellent free alternative exists (or you can be 10x better)
- The tool naturally connects to your paid product
- You have engineering resources to build AND maintain it
- The tool produces shareable, bookmark-worthy output

**Do NOT build when:**
- A well-established free tool already exists and is sufficient
- The tool would be a thin wrapper with no unique value
- You cannot maintain it post-launch
- The tool requires data you do not have or cannot access
- Total addressable search volume is < 200/month

---

## Clarify First

Before designing the free tool, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Tool concept + type** — calculator, generator, checker, grader, converter, template, or visualization (drives build complexity and lead-capture fit)
- [ ] **Target keyword + search volume** — the "free [tool]" search demand (a core factor in the 6-factor go/no-go score)
- [ ] **Primary goal** — leads, SEO traffic, backlinks, or brand (selects the tool type and gate strategy)
- [ ] **Connection to your paid product** — without it, leads won't convert (determines whether to build at all)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the plan.

## Tool Type Selection

| Tool Type | What It Does | Build Complexity | Lead Capture Fit | SEO Value | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| Calculator | Takes inputs, outputs a number/range | Low-Medium | High (email the full report) | High | ROI calculator, LTV calculator, salary calculator |
| Generator | Creates text, ideas, or structured content | Low (template) to High (AI) | Medium (save/download results) | High | Headline generator, name generator, bio writer |
| Checker/Auditor | Analyzes a URL, text, or file and scores it | Medium-High | Very high (full report via email) | Very high | SEO audit, readability checker, accessibility checker |
| Grader | Scores something against a rubric | Medium | High (detailed scorecard) | High | Website grader, email subject line grader |
| Converter | Transforms input from one format to another | Low-Medium | Low (utility, quick use) | Medium | Unit converter, file converter, timezone converter |
| Template Library | Pre-built fillable documents | Very low | Medium (download gated) | High | Contract templates, brief templates, spreadsheet templates |
| Interactive Visualization | Shows data or concepts visually | High | Medium | Very high (link magnet) | Market maps, comparison charts, trend visualizers |

### Selection Decision Tree

```
What do you want to generate?
├── Leads (email capture) → Checker/Auditor or Calculator (report gating)
├── SEO traffic → Calculator or Checker (high search volume keywords)
├── Backlinks → Interactive Visualization or Template Library (link magnet)
├── Brand awareness → Generator (shareable output, social virality)
└── All of the above → Checker/Auditor (highest combined value)
```

## 6-Factor Evaluation Framework

Score each tool idea 1-5 on each factor. Maximum score: 30.

| Factor | What to Check | 1 (Weak) | 3 (Moderate) | 5 (Strong) |
|--------|--------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Search Volume | Monthly searches for "free [tool]" | < 100/mo | 500-2,000/mo | > 5,000/mo |
| Competition | Quality of existing free tools | Excellent tools exist | Decent tools, room to improve | No good free alternatives |
| Build Effort | Engineering time required | Months of work | 1-2 weeks | Days |
| Lead Capture Potential | Natural email gate opportunity | Forced gate kills UX | Reasonable gate | Natural fit (report, saved results) |
| SEO Value | Topical authority and backlink potential | Thin, one-page utility | Moderate content depth | Deep use case, link magnet |
| Viral Potential | Will users share results or embed? | Nobody would share | Some sharing potential | Results are inherently shareable |

### Scoring Thresholds

| Score | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| 25-30 | Build immediately -- strong across all factors |
| 20-24 | Strong candidate -- validate search volume before committing |
| 15-19 | Conditional -- only if resources are available and strategic fit is strong |
| < 15 | Do not build -- rethink the concept or find a different angle |

---

## Tool Design Principles

### Value Before Gate

**The cardinal rule:** Give the core value first. Gate the upgrade.

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| Show the score immediately, offer to email the full report | "Enter your email to see your results" |
| Display the generated content, gate the save/export | Block all output behind email wall |
| Free basic analysis, premium detailed breakdown | Nothing visible without signup |

### Minimal Friction Input

- Maximum 3 inputs to get initial results
- No account required for core value
- Progressive disclosure: simple first, detailed on request
- Smart defaults where possible (auto-detect, pre-fill)

### Shareable Output

Design results so users want to share them:

| Mechanism | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Unique results URL | Each run gets a shareable permalink |
| Social share buttons | "Tweet your score" with pre-filled text |
| Downloadable report | PDF or CSV export |
| Embeddable badge/widget | "Scored 92/100 by [Your Tool]" badge |
| Visual score card | Social-media-ready image with result |

### Mobile-First Design

- All inputs work on touch screens
- Results render cleanly on mobile
- Share buttons trigger native share sheet
- No hover-dependent UI elements

---

## Lead Capture Architecture

### When to Gate

| Gate Decision | Criteria |
|--------------|---------|
| Gate with email | Results are complex (report format), ongoing value (re-run monthly), personalized output |
| Do NOT gate | Core result is a single number, competition offers the same ungated, primary goal is SEO/backlinks |

### Progressive Capture

Do not ask for everything at once. Build the profile over multiple interactions.

| Interaction | What to Capture | How |
|------------|----------------|-----|
| First use | Email (to save or email results) | Inline form after results display |
| Return use | Name + Role | Contextual prompt, not a blocking form |
| Repeated use | Company + Team size | If they request team features or saved history |

### Capture Form Design

- Email-only first gate (single field + submit button)
- Position the form AFTER results are shown (not before)
- Explain the value: "Email me a detailed breakdown" not "Sign up"
- Privacy text: "We'll send your report. No spam."
- Never require account creation for the free tool

## SEO Landing Page Strategy

### Page Structure

```
H1: Free [Tool Name] -- [What It Does in One Phrase]
Subhead: [Who it is for] + [what problem it solves]

[THE TOOL -- above the fold, interactive]

H2: How [Tool Name] Works
  (3-4 steps with screenshots)

H2: Why [Audience] Use [Tool Name]
  (Benefits, use cases, 3-5 paragraphs)

H2: [Related Question 1] (FAQ-style, keyword-targeted)
H2: [Related Question 2]
H2: [Related Question 3]

H2: Frequently Asked Questions
  (5-7 FAQs with FAQPage schema)
```

### SEO Requirements

- Target keyword in: H1, URL slug, meta title, first 100 words, 2+ subheadings
- Meta title: "Free [Tool Name]: [Action Verb] Your [Outcome] | [Brand]"
- Meta description: Include the keyword + what the tool does + "Free, no signup required"
- URL: `/tools/[tool-name]` or `/free-[tool-name]`

### Schema Markup

Add `SoftwareApplication` schema:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "Free [Tool Name]",
  "applicationCategory": "BusinessApplication",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  },
  "description": "[What the tool does]",
  "operatingSystem": "Web"
}
```

Also add FAQPage schema for the FAQ section.

---

## Measurement Framework

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You | Target (90 days) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Tool usage (sessions) | Is anyone using it? | 500+ sessions/month |
| Completion rate | Do users finish using it? | > 60% |
| Lead conversion rate | Is it generating leads? | 5-15% of completions |
| Organic traffic | Is it ranking? | 500+ sessions/month from organic |
| Referring domains | Is it earning backlinks? | 10+ organic backlinks |
| Email to pipeline rate | Is it generating qualified leads? | Track in CRM |
| Bounce rate | Is the tool engaging? | < 50% |

### ROI Calculation

```
Monthly Cost = Engineering hours x Hourly rate + Hosting cost
Monthly Value = (Leads x Lead-to-Customer Rate x ACV) + (Backlink value estimate)

Break-even month = Total build cost / Monthly value
Target: Break-even within 6 months
```

---

## Maintenance and Iteration

### Ongoing Maintenance Requirements

| Task | Frequency | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Check for broken APIs/data sources | Monthly | External dependencies change |
| Update calculations/logic if standards change | As needed | Accuracy maintains trust |
| Review and fix UX issues from user feedback | Quarterly | Continuous improvement |
| Update SEO landing page content | Semi-annually | Content freshness |
| Check analytics for usage trends | Monthly | Identify optimization opportunities |

### Iteration Based on Data

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| High usage, low lead capture | Improve gate positioning or offer |
| Low usage, high search ranking | Improve tool UX and value |
| High leads, low quality | Add qualifying questions to capture form |
| High bounce rate | Improve above-fold messaging and tool visibility |
| Low search ranking | Improve page content depth and backlink acquisition |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| High traffic to tool but low lead capture | Gate is too aggressive or positioned before value delivery | Show core results first, then gate the detailed report or export; use email-only capture form |
| Tool built but no organic traffic after 3 months | SEO landing page is thin or keywords are too competitive | Add 1500+ words of supporting content (how it works, use cases, FAQ); target long-tail keywords |
| Tool is used once but users do not return | No recurring value or no save/bookmark mechanism | Add saved results, email reports, or periodic re-run reminders; consider a "monitor" mode |
| Build cost exceeded estimate | Scope creep during development | Use tool_roi_calculator.py upfront to set budget ceiling; define MVP scope and ship in 2 weeks max |
| Product Hunt launch got minimal traction | Poor timing or weak positioning | Launch Tuesday-Thursday; lead with the user benefit, not the technology; get 5+ early upvotes from network |
| Tool generates leads but low conversion to paid | Tool attracts wrong audience or no connection to paid product | Ensure the tool solves a problem your paid product also addresses; add contextual upgrade prompts |

---

## Success Criteria

- Tool scores 20+ on the 6-factor evaluation framework before committing to build
- Tool achieves 500+ monthly sessions within 90 days of launch
- Lead conversion rate of 5-15% of tool completions
- Tool earns 10+ organic backlinks within 6 months
- Break-even achieved within 6 months (verified by tool_roi_calculator.py)
- Completion rate above 60% (users who start using the tool finish the workflow)
- At least 1 supporting blog post and social launch content published at launch

---

## Scope & Limitations

- **In scope:** Tool idea evaluation, ROI modeling, launch planning, distribution strategy, lead capture architecture, SEO landing page strategy, measurement framework
- **Out of scope:** Engineering implementation, design/UI work, paid advertising strategy, AI/ML-powered tool features
- **Build constraint:** All tools should be buildable in 1-4 weeks; if longer, the scope is too large for a free marketing tool
- **Maintenance cost:** Every tool requires ongoing maintenance (monthly checks, quarterly content updates); budget for this before building
- **No API dependencies:** Free tools should use client-side logic where possible to avoid ongoing API costs and reliability issues

---

## Integration Points

- **form-cro** -- Use for optimizing the lead capture form embedded within the free tool
- **page-cro** -- Use for optimizing the SEO landing page that hosts the tool for conversion
- **seo-audit** -- Use for validating the tool landing page meets technical SEO requirements
- **content-creator** -- Use for writing the launch blog post, social content, and outreach emails
- **schema-markup** -- Use for implementing SoftwareApplication and FAQPage schema on the tool page
