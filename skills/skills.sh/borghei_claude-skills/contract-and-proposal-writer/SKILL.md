# Contract & Proposal Writer

**Tier:** POWERFUL
**Category:** Business Growth
**Tags:** contracts, proposals, SOW, NDA, MSA, GDPR, legal templates, freelance

## Overview

Generate professional, jurisdiction-aware business documents: freelance contracts, project proposals, statements of work, NDAs, and master service agreements. Outputs structured Markdown with conversion instructions for DOCX and PDF. Covers US (Delaware), EU (GDPR), UK, and DACH (German law) jurisdictions with clause libraries for each.

**This is not a substitute for legal counsel.** Use these templates as strong starting points. Review with an attorney for engagements over $50K or involving complex IP, equity, or regulatory requirements.

---

## Core Capabilities

- Fixed-price and hourly development contracts
- Monthly consulting retainer agreements
- Project proposals with timeline and budget breakdown
- Statements of Work (SOW) with deliverables matrix and acceptance criteria
- NDAs (mutual and one-way)
- Master Service Agreements (MSA) with SOW attachment framework
- SaaS partnership agreements (reseller, referral, white-label, integration)
- GDPR Data Processing Addenda (Art. 28) for EU/DACH
- Jurisdiction-specific clause library (US, EU, UK, DACH)
- Change order and scope management clauses

---

## Clarify First

Before drafting the document, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Document type** — contract, proposal, SOW, NDA, or MSA (selects the template and required clauses)
- [ ] **Jurisdiction** — US-Delaware, EU, UK, or DACH (drives IP, liability, and governing-law clauses; DACH needs Nutzungsrechte, EU needs a DPA)
- [ ] **Engagement model + value** — fixed-price, hourly, retainer, or revenue-share and total value (drives payment terms and liability cap)
- [ ] **Personal data involved** — triggers a mandatory GDPR Art. 28 DPA for EU/DACH engagements

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the document.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering

Gather before drafting:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Document type? | Contract, proposal, SOW, NDA, MSA |
| Jurisdiction? | US-Delaware, EU, UK, DACH |
| Engagement model? | Fixed-price, hourly, retainer, revenue-share |
| Parties? | Legal names, roles, registered addresses |
| Scope summary? | 1-3 sentences describing the work |
| Total value or rate? | Drives payment terms and liability caps |
| Timeline? | Start date, end date or duration, milestones |
| Special requirements? | IP assignment, white-label, subcontractors, non-compete |
| Personal data involved? | Triggers GDPR DPA requirement in EU/DACH |

### Step 2: Template Selection

| Document Type | Engagement Model | Template |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Dev contract | Fixed-price | Template A: Fixed-Price Development |
| Dev contract | Hourly/Retainer | Template B: Consulting Retainer |
| Partnership | Revenue-share | Template C: SaaS Partnership |
| NDA | Mutual | Template NDA-M |
| NDA | One-way (discloser/recipient) | Template NDA-OW |
| SOW | Any | Template SOW (attaches to MSA or standalone) |
| Proposal | Any | Template P: Project Proposal |

### Step 3: Generate & Fill

Fill all `[BRACKETED]` placeholders. Flag missing information as `[REQUIRED - description]`. Never leave blanks -- an incomplete contract is more dangerous than no contract.

### Step 4: Review Checklist

Before sending any generated document:

- [ ] All `[BRACKETED]` placeholders filled
- [ ] Correct jurisdiction selected and consistent throughout
- [ ] Payment terms match engagement model
- [ ] IP clause matches jurisdiction requirements
- [ ] Liability cap is reasonable (typically 1x-3x contract value)
- [ ] Termination clauses include both for-cause and for-convenience
- [ ] DPA included if personal data is processed (EU/DACH mandatory)
- [ ] Force majeure clause included for engagements over 3 months
- [ ] Change order process defined for fixed-price contracts
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined for each deliverable

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Missing IP assignment language | Unclear ownership, disputes | Always include explicit IP clause per jurisdiction |
| Vague acceptance criteria | Endless revision cycles | Define "accepted" = written sign-off within X days |
| No change order process | Scope creep on fixed-price | Include change order clause with pricing mechanism |
| Jurisdiction mismatch | Unenforceable clauses | Match governing law to where parties operate |
| Missing liability cap | Unlimited exposure | Always cap liability at 1-3x contract value |
| Oral amendments | Unenforceable modifications | Require written amendments signed by both parties |
| No DPA for EU data | GDPR violation, up to 4% global revenue fine | Always include DPA when processing EU personal data |
| Missing force majeure | No protection against unforeseeable events | Include for engagements over 3 months |

---

## Best Practices

1. Use milestone payments over net-30 for projects over $10K -- reduces cash flow risk for both parties
2. Always include a change order clause in fixed-price contracts
3. For DACH: include Schriftformklausel (written form clause) explicitly
4. Define response time SLAs in retainer agreements (e.g., 4h urgent / 24h normal)
5. Keep templates in version control; review annually as laws change
6. For NDAs: always specify return/destruction of confidential materials on termination
7. Include a survival clause -- specify which clauses survive termination (confidentiality, IP, liability)
8. For EU/DACH: check if consumer protection laws apply (B2C engagements have additional requirements)

```bash
python scripts/proposal_cost_estimator.py --hourly-rate 150 --hours 200 --phases 4
python scripts/proposal_cost_estimator.py --hourly-rate 150 --hours 200 --phases 4 --json
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--hourly-rate` | Yes | Hourly rate in dollars |

| `--margin` | No | Desired profit margin percentage (default: 20) |
| `--currency` | No | Currency code (default: USD) |
| `--json` | No | Output results as JSON |

### 3. contract_comparison_analyzer.py

**Purpose:** Compare two contract versions and identify differences in key clauses, payment terms, and risk areas.

```bash
python scripts/contract_comparison_analyzer.py contract_v1.json contract_v2.json
python scripts/contract_comparison_analyzer.py contract_v1.json contract_v2.json --json
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `contract_v1.json` | Yes | JSON file with first contract version |
| `contract_v2.json` | Yes | JSON file with second contract version |
| `--json` | No | Output results as JSON |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Placeholders left in final document | Rushed filling process | Use contract_clause_checker.py to scan for unfilled [BRACKETED] placeholders before sending |
| IP clause is unenforceable in EU/DACH | Using US work-for-hire language in EU context | Switch to explicit Nutzungsrechte transfer for DACH; use separate written assignment deed for EU |
| Client disputes scope after signing | Vague acceptance criteria or missing change order process | Define "accepted" = written sign-off within X business days; include change order clause with pricing mechanism |
| Payment disputes on hourly contracts | No time tracking requirement or unclear invoicing terms | Specify time tracking tool, invoicing frequency (monthly), and payment terms (net-30) in the contract |
| GDPR non-compliance penalty risk | Missing DPA for EU/DACH engagements involving personal data | Always include Art. 28 DPA when processing EU personal data; use the template block in this skill |
| Contract fails legal review | Jurisdiction mismatch or missing mandatory clauses | Run contract_clause_checker.py against the target jurisdiction before legal review |

---

## Success Criteria

- All [BRACKETED] placeholders filled before document delivery
- Correct jurisdiction selected and consistent throughout (verified by contract_clause_checker.py)
- Payment terms match engagement model with clear invoicing cadence
- IP clause matches jurisdiction requirements (work-for-hire for US, Nutzungsrechte for DACH)
- Liability cap set at 1-3x contract value with consequential damages excluded
- DPA included for all EU/DACH engagements involving personal data
- Change order process defined for all fixed-price contracts

---

## Scope & Limitations

- **In scope:** Contract templates, proposal generation, clause libraries, jurisdiction-specific compliance, document comparison, cost estimation
- **Out of scope:** Legal advice, contract negotiation strategy, litigation support, regulatory filings
- **Not legal counsel:** These templates are starting points; review with an attorney for engagements over $50K or involving complex IP, equity, or regulatory requirements
- **Jurisdiction coverage:** US (Delaware), EU (general), UK, DACH (Germany/Austria/Switzerland); other jurisdictions may require additional legal review
- **Currency:** Cost estimator defaults to USD; adjust for local currency in international engagements

---

## Integration Points

- **ceo-advisor** -- Strategic decisions about partnership structures and business models that drive contract type selection
- **cfo-advisor** -- Financial terms, revenue recognition, and pricing strategy that inform payment schedule and margin targets
- **customer-success-manager** -- SOW and MSA structures for customer engagements; renewal terms feed into CS workflows
- **pricing-strategy** -- When proposal pricing needs strategic positioning against competitors or market rates
- **revenue-operations** -- Contract values and payment schedules feed into pipeline forecasting and revenue recognition
