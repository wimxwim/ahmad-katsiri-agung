## Clarify First

Before the assessment, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Processing activity description** — purpose, data types, automation level, scale — drives the Art. 35(3) trigger matches and EDPB criteria scoring (the whole verdict)
- [ ] **Special-category data + scale** — determines the Art. 35(3)(b) trigger, the Art. 9 cumulative-basis requirement, and the large-scale four-factor test
- [ ] **Jurisdiction(s)** — which national blacklists apply (DE/FR/IE/BE/NL/IT/PL); the most restrictive governs
- [ ] **Whether an AI system is involved** — triggers dual-phase (training/inference) analysis per EDPB Opinion 28/2024 and the separate FRIA distinction

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the assessment.

## Tools

### DPIA Threshold Checker

Evaluates whether a DPIA is required based on processing activity description. Checks Art. 35(3) mandatory triggers and 9 EDPB criteria.

```bash
# Check a processing activity (interactive prompts)
python scripts/dpia_threshold_checker.py --activity "AI-based credit scoring using financial and behavioral data of retail banking customers across EU"

# Check from JSON description
python scripts/dpia_threshold_checker.py --input processing.json

# JSON output
python scripts/dpia_threshold_checker.py --activity "Employee monitoring via CCTV in workplace" --json

# Generate blank input template
python scripts/dpia_threshold_checker.py --template > processing.json
```

**Checks performed:**
- Art. 35(3)(a): Automated decision-making with legal/significant effect
- Art. 35(3)(b): Large-scale processing of special category data (Art. 9) or criminal data (Art. 10)
- Art. 35(3)(c): Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible area on large scale
- 9 EDPB criteria from WP 248 rev.01 with two-criterion presumption rule

**Output:**
- Verdict: Required / Recommended / Not Required
- Art. 35(3) trigger matches
- EDPB criteria scores with reasoning
- Two-criterion presumption analysis

---

### DPIA Risk Register

Manages a DPIA risk register in JSON format. Add risks, apply mitigations, and calculate residual risk.

```bash
# Initialize a new risk register
python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py init --output dpia_risks.json

# Add a risk
python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py add --register dpia_risks.json \
  --description "Unauthorized access to profiling data" \
  --rights-category "right-to-privacy" \
  --likelihood 4 --severity 3

# Add mitigation to a risk
python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py mitigate --register dpia_risks.json \
  --risk-id 1 --measure "Implement role-based access control" \
  --likelihood-reduction 2 --severity-reduction 1

# View risk register table
python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py view --register dpia_risks.json

# Generate residual risk summary
python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py summary --register dpia_risks.json --json

# Check Art. 36 consultation threshold
python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py art36-check --register dpia_risks.json
```

**Rights categories:** right-to-privacy, non-discrimination, freedom-of-expression, right-to-information, right-to-not-be-subject-to-automated-decisions, right-to-physical-safety

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Full DPIA Assessment

```
Step 1: Threshold check — determine if DPIA required
        → python scripts/dpia_threshold_checker.py --activity "description"

Step 2: If Required or Recommended, describe the processing
        → Document purpose, legal basis, data categories, recipients, retention

Step 3: Assess necessity and proportionality
        → Confirm lawful basis (Art. 6, cumulative with Art. 9 if special categories)
        → Verify purpose limitation, data minimization, storage limitation

Step 4: Identify risks from data subject perspective
        → python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py init --output dpia_risks.json
        → Add risks using references/risk_scoring_methodology.md catalog

Step 5: Apply mitigations and calculate residual risk
        → python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py mitigate --register dpia_risks.json ...

Step 6: Check Art. 36 consultation requirement
        → python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py art36-check --register dpia_risks.json

Step 7: Document and review
        → python scripts/dpia_risk_register.py summary --register dpia_risks.json
```

### Workflow 2: Quick Threshold Assessment

```
Step 1: Describe the processing activity
        → python scripts/dpia_threshold_checker.py --template > processing.json
        → Fill in processing details

Step 2: Run threshold check
        → python scripts/dpia_threshold_checker.py --input processing.json --json

Step 3: Review verdict and reasoning
        → Required: proceed to full DPIA (Workflow 1)
        → Recommended: proceed unless strong justification to skip (document)
        → Not Required: document the assessment and rationale
```

### Workflow 3: AI System DPIA

```
Step 1: Classify AI system (EU AI Act risk level if applicable)
        → Map to DPIA triggers (automated decision-making, profiling, scoring)

Step 2: Run threshold check with AI-specific indicators
        → python scripts/dpia_threshold_checker.py --activity "AI system description"

Step 3: Dual-phase risk analysis (EDPB Opinion 28/2024)
        → Phase 1: Training data risks (collection, bias, consent)
        → Phase 2: Inference risks (decisions, profiling, transparency)

Step 4: Assess from data subject perspective
        → Add risks covering both training and inference phases
        → Include algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, unfair outcomes

Step 5: Apply mitigations specific to AI
        → Explainability measures, human oversight, bias testing
        → Document FRIA distinction per EU AI Act Art. 27 if applicable
```

## Legal Precision Points

12 points of legal precision that distinguish expert-level DPIA work.

| # | Point | Detail |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Art. 35(3) absolute triggers** | Three mandatory triggers require DPIA regardless of other analysis: (a) automated decisions with legal effect, (b) large-scale special category/criminal data, (c) systematic public area monitoring |
| 2 | **Two-criterion presumption** | If 2 or more of the 9 EDPB criteria are met, DPIA is presumptively required (WP 248 rev.01). Can rebut only with documented justification |
| 3 | **Art. 9 cumulative with Art. 6** | Special category data requires BOTH an Art. 6 lawful basis AND an Art. 9(2) exception. Neither alone is sufficient |
| 4 | **Large scale four-factor test** | Assess: (a) number of data subjects, (b) volume of data, (c) geographic extent, (d) duration/permanence. No fixed numeric threshold |
| 5 | **National blacklists additive** | SA-published lists of processing operations requiring DPIA add to (not replace) Art. 35(3) and EDPB criteria |
| 6 | **Multi-jurisdictional checking** | If processing spans multiple member states, check each SA's blacklist. Most restrictive list applies |
| 7 | **Pre-processing obligation** | DPIA must be completed BEFORE processing begins (Art. 35(1)). Retroactive DPIAs do not satisfy the requirement |
| 8 | **AI dual-phase analysis** | EDPB Opinion 28/2024: AI systems require separate risk analysis for training phase and inference/deployment phase |
| 9 | **Art. 36 sequential** | Prior consultation with SA (Art. 36) is triggered only AFTER DPIA is completed and residual risk remains high. Cannot skip the DPIA |
| 10 | **Pseudonymization nuance** | EDPB Guidelines 01/2025: pseudonymization reduces risk but does not eliminate DPIA requirement. Still personal data |
| 11 | **Data subject perspective** | All risks must be assessed from the data subject's perspective (Recital 75), not the controller's business perspective |
| 12 | **AI Act FRIA distinction** | EU AI Act Art. 27 requires Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) for high-risk AI. FRIA is separate from GDPR DPIA — both may be required |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Threshold checker says "Not Required" but processing feels risky | Activity description too vague or missing key details | Provide more specific description including data types, scale, automation level, and data subject categories |
| Two-criterion presumption triggered but controller disagrees | Controller must document justification for rebutting presumption | Document specific reasons why DPIA is not needed despite criteria match; SA may challenge this |
| Risk register shows High residual risk after mitigations | Mitigations insufficient or not properly scored | Review mitigation effectiveness; consider additional controls; if residual risk remains high, Art. 36 consultation required |
| Multi-jurisdictional check produces conflicting results | Different SAs have different blacklists and thresholds | Apply the most restrictive requirement; document the analysis for each jurisdiction |
| AI system DPIA unclear on training vs. inference risks | Training and inference phases have different risk profiles | Separate the analysis per EDPB Opinion 28/2024; assess each phase independently then combine |
| Art. 36 check unclear on threshold | Residual risk near the boundary between High and Very High | Document the borderline assessment; consider voluntary consultation as good practice |

---

## Success Criteria

- **All high-risk processing activities assessed** -- threshold check completed before processing begins, with documented verdict and reasoning
- **Risk register complete with mitigations** -- every identified risk has likelihood, severity, rights category, and at least one mitigation measure
- **Residual risk acceptable or Art. 36 consultation initiated** -- no unaddressed Very High residual risks
- **Documentation meets SA expectations** -- assessment follows Art. 35(7) requirements: systematic description, necessity/proportionality, risks, mitigations
- **EDPB criteria properly applied** -- two-criterion presumption correctly evaluated with documented reasoning

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- DPIA threshold assessment against Art. 35(3) triggers and EDPB criteria
- Risk register management with mitigation tracking and residual risk calculation
- Art. 36 prior consultation threshold assessment
- Multi-jurisdictional blacklist awareness (DE, FR, IE, BE, NL, IT, PL)
- AI system dual-phase DPIA analysis guidance
- Data subject perspective risk assessment per Recital 75

**Out of Scope:**
- Legal advice on lawful basis selection (Art. 6) or Art. 9(2) exception applicability
- Supervisory authority submission or interaction
- Technical implementation of mitigations (encryption, access control)
- DPO appointment or consultation logistics
- National blacklist exhaustive coverage beyond listed jurisdictions
- EU AI Act conformity assessment (see eu-ai-act-specialist)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Conducting DPIA after processing has started** -- Art. 35(1) requires DPIA before processing begins; retroactive DPIAs do not satisfy the legal obligation and create enforcement exposure
- **Assessing risk from the controller's perspective** -- DPIA risks must be evaluated from the data subject's perspective per Recital 75; business impact is irrelevant to this analysis; a breach that is minor for the company may be catastrophic for affected individuals
- **Treating pseudonymization as eliminating DPIA need** -- pseudonymized data remains personal data under GDPR (Recital 26); pseudonymization is a mitigation that reduces risk scores, not a basis for skipping the DPIA entirely
- **Skipping Art. 36 consultation when residual risk is high** -- if residual risk remains Very High after mitigations, prior consultation with the supervisory authority is mandatory, not optional
- **Conflating DPIA with FRIA** -- the EU AI Act's Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (Art. 27) is a separate obligation from GDPR DPIA; completing one does not satisfy the other; both may be required for AI systems processing personal data
