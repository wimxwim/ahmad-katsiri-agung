# Company Operating System

The operating system is the collection of tools, rhythms, and agreements that determine how the company functions. Every company has one -- most just do not know what it is. Making it explicit makes it improvable.

## Clarify First

Before generating, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Company size and stage** — the framework recommendation (EOS / Scaling Up / OKR-native / Holacracy) and implementation timeline are driven primarily by headcount
- [ ] **What is actually broken** (no scorecard, misaligned priorities, recurring unresolved issues, meeting overload) — determines which of the six components to build first
- [ ] **Founder operating style** (operational vs. visionary) and whether the company is engineering-led or sales-led — tips the framework choice within a given size band
- [ ] **What rhythms and metrics already exist** — so the new OS replaces meetings rather than stacking on top and causing meeting fatigue

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the artifact.

## Operating System Selection

### Decision Tree

```
START: "Which operating system?"
  |
  v
[Company size?]
  |
  +-- 10-50 people
  |     |
  |     v
  |   [Is the founder operational or visionary?]
  |     |
  |     +-- Operational --> EOS / Traction (structured, simple)
  |     +-- Visionary --> Scaling Up (ambitious, strategy-heavy)
  |
  +-- 50-200 people
  |     |
  |     v
  |   [Engineering-led or sales-led?]
  |     |
  |     +-- Engineering-led --> OKR-native (hypothesis-driven)
  |     +-- Sales-led --> Scaling Up or EOS (execution-focused)
  |
  +-- 200+ people
  |     |
  |     v
  |   [High autonomy or high alignment needed?]
  |     |
  |     +-- High autonomy --> Holacracy (only if patient)
  |     +-- High alignment --> Custom hybrid (best of EOS + OKR)
  |
  +-- Not sure --> Start with EOS. It is the simplest to implement.
```

### Framework Comparison Matrix

| Feature | EOS | Scaling Up | OKR-Native | Holacracy |
|---------|-----|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Complexity | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| Implementation time | 30-90 days | 90-180 days | 60-120 days | 6-12 months |
| Best company size | 10-250 | 50-500 | 20-500 | 50-300 |
| Goal framework | Rocks (binary) | OKRs + Priorities | OKRs (graded) | Roles + accountabilities |
| Meeting cadence | Weekly L10 | Daily huddle + weekly | Weekly + quarterly | Governance + tactical |
| Issue resolution | IDS | Keep/Kill/Combine | Retrospective | Governance process |
| Accountability | Accountability chart | Function accountability | OKR ownership | Role-based |
| Scorecard | Weekly numbers | Weekly KPIs | Quarterly KRs | Metrics per role |
| Strengths | Simple, fast to implement | Rigorous, strategy-heavy | Flexible, tech-friendly | Distributed authority |
| Weaknesses | Can feel rigid | Complex, requires discipline | Can drift without structure | Steep learning curve |

## The Six Core Components

Every effective operating system has these six, regardless of framework:

### Component 1: Accountability Chart

Not an org chart. An accountability chart answers: "Who owns this outcome?"

#### Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Single ownership | One person owns each function. Multiple may work in it. |
| Explicit gaps | Functions nobody owns are identified and assigned. |
| No overlap | If two people think they own it, neither does. Resolve immediately. |
| Stage-appropriate | One person can own multiple seats early. Be explicit about it. |
| Quarterly review | Ownership shifts as company grows. Review every quarter. |

#### Accountability Chart Template

```
CEO
  |
  +-- Revenue (CRO/VP Sales)
  |     +-- Inbound pipeline
  |     +-- Outbound pipeline
  |     +-- Customer success
  |
  +-- Product & Engineering (CTO/CPO)
  |     +-- Product roadmap
  |     +-- Engineering delivery
  |     +-- Technical operations
  |
  +-- Operations (COO)
  |     +-- Finance & legal
  |     +-- People operations
  |     +-- Business operations
  |
  +-- Marketing (CMO/VP Marketing)
        +-- Demand generation
        +-- Brand & content
        +-- Product marketing
```

#### Workshop Protocol (2 hours)

```
Step 1: List all functions the company performs (30 min)
Step 2: Assign ONE owner per function (30 min)
Step 3: Identify gaps (functions nobody owns) (15 min)
Step 4: Identify overlaps (2+ people claiming ownership) (15 min)
Step 5: Resolve gaps and overlaps (20 min)
Step 6: Publish and communicate (10 min)
```

### Component 2: Scorecard

Weekly metrics that tell you if the company is on track. Not monthly. Not quarterly. Weekly.

#### Scorecard Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| 5-15 metrics maximum | More than 15 = nothing gets attention |
| Each metric has an owner | Ownership drives accountability |
| Each metric has a weekly target | Not a range -- a specific number |
| Red/Yellow/Green status | Not paragraphs -- traffic lights |
| Only Red metrics get discussion | Green = no discussion needed in meeting |

#### Example Scorecard

| Metric | Owner | Target | Week | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| New MRR | CRO | $50K | $43K | [R] |
| Logo churn | CS Lead | < 1% | 0.8% | [G] |
| Active users | CPO | 2,000 | 2,150 | [G] |
| Deployments | CTO | 3/week | 3 | [G] |
| Critical bugs open | CTO | 0 | 2 | [R] |
| Runway | CFO | > 18mo | 16mo | [Y] |
| Offer acceptance | CHRO | > 85% | 90% | [G] |

### Component 3: Meeting Pulse

#### Full Meeting Rhythm

| Meeting | Frequency | Duration | Who | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----|---------|
| Daily standup | Daily | 15 min | Each team | Blockers only |
| L10 / Leadership sync | Weekly | 90 min | Leadership team | Scorecard + issues |
| Department review | Monthly | 60 min | Dept + leadership | Deep dive on dept metrics |
| Quarterly planning | Quarterly | 1-2 days | Leadership | Set rocks, review strategy |
| Annual planning | Annual | 2-3 days | Leadership | 1-year + 3-year vision |

#### L10 Meeting Agenda (Weekly Leadership)

| Segment | Duration | Activity |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Good news | 5 min | Personal + business wins |
| Scorecard review | 5 min | Flag red items only |
| Rock review | 5 min | On/off track for each rock |
| Customer/employee headlines | 5 min | Notable events |
| Issues list (IDS) | 60 min | Identify, Discuss, Solve |
| To-dos review | 5 min | Last week's commitments: done or not? |
| Conclude | 5 min | Rate meeting 1-10, what would make it 10 next time |

### Component 4: Issue Resolution (IDS)

Maximum 15 minutes per issue. This is the core problem-solving loop.

```
IDENTIFY: What is the actual issue? (One sentence, root cause, not symptom)
  |
DISCUSS: Relevant facts + perspectives. Time-boxed.
  |       When discussion starts repeating, STOP.
  |
SOLVE: One owner. One action. One due date. Written down.
```

#### IDS Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| "Let's take this offline" | Things taken offline rarely get resolved | Solve it now or put it on next week's list |
| Discussing without deciding | Great discussion, no action item = wasted | Every discussion must end with a decision |
| Revisiting decided issues | Undermines the system | Once solved, off the list. Reopen only with new data. |
| Issue on list 3+ meetings | Either not real or too scary to address | Force it: address this week or remove it |
| Multiple issues conflated | Impossible to solve a bundled problem | One issue per entry. Separate if needed. |

### Component 5: Rocks (90-Day Priorities)

#### Rock Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| 3-7 per person maximum | More than 7 = none get done |
| 3-7 company-level rocks | Shared leadership priorities |
| Binary status: done or not done | No "60% complete" |
| Set at quarterly planning | Reviewed weekly (on/off track) |
| Not a to-do list | Rocks take 90 days of sustained work |

#### Good vs. Bad Rocks

| Bad Rock | Why | Good Rock |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| "Improve sales process" | Not measurable or specific | "Implement CRM with pipeline stages and reporting by Mar 31" |
| "Hire more engineers" | No target, no deadline | "Hire 3 senior engineers with offers accepted by Apr 15" |
| "Reduce churn" | No target | "Reduce monthly logo churn from 3% to 1.5% by end of Q2" |
| "Get better at communication" | Not observable | "Ship weekly company update every Friday for 12 weeks" |

### Component 6: Communication Cadence

| Audience | What | When | Format |
|----------|------|------|--------|
| All employees | Company update | Monthly | Written + Q&A |
| All employees | Quarterly results + priorities | Quarterly | All-hands meeting |
| Leadership team | Scorecard | Weekly | Dashboard |
| Board | Company performance | Monthly or quarterly | Board memo/deck |
| Investors | Key metrics + narrative | Monthly or quarterly | Investor update |
| Customers | Product updates | Per release | Release notes |

**Default rule**: If deciding whether to share internally, share it. Under-communication always costs more than over-communication.

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### 30-Day Quick Start

| Week | Activity | Time Investment |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Build accountability chart | 2-hour workshop |
| 2 | Define 5-10 weekly scorecard metrics | 1-hour alignment session |
| 3 | Start weekly L10 meeting | 90 min/week (ongoing) |
| 4 | Set first round of 90-day rocks | Half-day planning session |

These four alone improve coordination more than most companies achieve in a year.

### 90-Day Full Implementation

| Month | Focus | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Accountability chart, scorecard, L10 meetings |
| 2 | Depth | Rocks defined, issues list active, daily standups |
| 3 | Cadence | Full meeting rhythm, communication cadence, first quarterly review |

---

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Partial implementation | "We do OKRs but skip check-ins" | Half an OS is worse than none. Commit to the full system. |
| Meeting fatigue | Added rhythm on top of existing meetings | Replace meetings, do not add them |
| Metric overload | 30 KPIs because "they all matter" | Start with 5. Add only when cadence is established. |
| Rock inflation | 12 rocks per person | Hard limit: 7 per person, 7 for the company. |
| Leader non-compliance | Leadership skips L10 or ignores IDS | The OS mirrors leadership respect. Leaders go first. |
| No quarterly review | Annual goals checked at year-end | Quarterly is the minimum review cycle. |
| Scorecard without targets | Tracking numbers without thresholds | Every metric needs a target to be actionable. |

---

## Red Flags

- Five team leads give different answers when asked "What are the top 3 company priorities?" -- alignment failure
- Same issue on the issues list for 4+ weeks -- avoidance or structural problem
- No weekly scorecard exists -- flying blind
- Rocks set but never reviewed weekly -- goals without accountability
- Accountability chart has not been updated in 6+ months -- reality has drifted
- Meetings consistently end without decisions -- meeting design problem
- Communication is all top-down, never bottom-up -- feedback loop broken

---

## Integration with C-Suite

| Role | OS Dependency |
|------|---------------|
| CEO (`ceo-advisor`) | Sets vision that feeds 1-year plan and rocks |
| COO (`coo-advisor`) | Owns meeting pulse and issue resolution cadence |
| CFO (`cfo-advisor`) | Owns financial metrics in the scorecard |
| CTO (`cto-advisor`) | Owns engineering rocks and tech scorecard metrics |
| CHRO (`chro-advisor`) | Owns people metrics (attrition, hiring velocity) |
| Culture Architect (`culture-architect`) | Culture rituals integrate into meeting pulse |
| Strategic Alignment (`strategic-alignment`) | Validates team rocks cascade from company rocks |
| Change Management (`change-management`) | New OS rollout follows ADKAR model |

---

## Output Artifacts

| Request | Deliverable |
|---------|-------------|
| "Set up our operating system" | Framework recommendation + 30-day implementation plan |
| "Design our meeting cadence" | Full meeting rhythm with agendas and owners |
| "Build our scorecard" | 5-15 metrics with owners, targets, and thresholds |
| "Help with quarterly planning" | Planning session agenda + rock-setting framework |
| "Fix our accountability" | Accountability chart workshop + gap/overlap analysis |
| "We keep discussing the same issues" | IDS training + issues list audit |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Five team leads give different answers about top 3 priorities | Alignment failure -- rocks not cascaded or not reviewed weekly | Re-run quarterly planning; review rocks weekly in L10; publish company priorities visibly |
| Same issue on the issues list for 4+ weeks | Avoidance or structural problem too scary to address | Force it: address this week or permanently remove; escalate if needed |
| Scorecard has 30+ KPIs | Metric overload -- nothing gets attention | Cut to 5-10 metrics. Only the ones that tell you if the company is on track. |
| Rocks set but never reviewed | Goals without accountability; L10 meeting not happening | Weekly L10 is non-negotiable; 5 minutes on rocks review every week |
| Leadership team skips L10 or ignores IDS | Leader non-compliance destroys the OS | CEO must enforce: leaders go first. If CEO skips, the OS dies. |
| Meetings added on top of existing meetings | Meeting fatigue from accumulation | Replace meetings, don't add them. Audit meeting inventory; eliminate redundancies |

---

## Success Criteria

- Weekly L10 meeting happens every week with 90%+ leadership attendance (no exceptions for 12+ consecutive weeks)
- Scorecard reviewed weekly with red metrics discussed using IDS format (zero red metrics ignored)
- 70%+ of quarterly rocks completed as binary done/not-done by end of quarter
- Issues list: average issue resolved within 2 meetings (no issue lingers 4+ weeks)
- All team leads can articulate top 3 company priorities identically (tested quarterly)
- Meeting hours per person per week below 10 hours (measured via meeting_pulse_designer.py)
- Accountability chart reviewed and updated quarterly with zero unowned functions

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope**: Operating system selection (EOS, Scaling Up, OKR, Holacracy), accountability charts, weekly scorecards, meeting pulse design, IDS issue resolution, 90-day rocks, communication cadence, implementation roadmap.

**Out of Scope**: OKR software configuration, project management tool setup, Agile/Scrum methodology, sprint planning, product backlog management, HR policy development.

**Limitations**: Scorecard builder calculates RAG from provided data but cannot source live metrics from business systems. Rocks tracker uses manual status updates -- it cannot automatically detect completion. Meeting pulse designer provides recommendations based on team size and meeting inventory but cannot account for company-specific cultural norms. Framework comparison is directional -- actual implementation success depends on leadership commitment.
