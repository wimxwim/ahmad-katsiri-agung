## When to Use

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Prospects comparing you to competitors | Create vs-pages for top 3 competitors |
| Search volume exists for "[competitor] alternative" | Create singular alternative pages |
| Sales team needs battle card content | Create vs-pages with objection handling |
| Competitor has comparison pages about you | Create counter-comparison pages |
| SEO gap on competitor-branded keywords | Build full alternative page set |

---

## Clarify First

Before writing the comparison content, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Page format** — singular alternative, plural alternatives, you-vs-competitor, or competitor-vs-competitor (selects the page structure template)
- [ ] **Primary goal** — SEO traffic capture vs sales enablement (changes tone, depth, and whether to include objection handling)
- [ ] **Target competitor + data freshness** — who, and how recent the pricing/feature data is (every claim must be verifiable)
- [ ] **Honest positioning** — who you genuinely win for and who the competitor wins for (drives the trust-building "who it's for" sections)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the page.

## Core Principles

### 1. Honesty Builds Trust
- Acknowledge competitor strengths explicitly
- Be accurate about your own limitations
- Readers are actively comparing -- they will verify your claims
- A dishonest comparison page damages your brand more than no page at all

### 2. Help Them Decide (Not Just Sell)
- Different tools genuinely fit different needs
- Be explicit about who you are best for AND who the competitor is best for
- Reduce evaluation friction -- save prospects research time

### 3. Depth Over Checkbox Tables
- Go beyond feature checklists (every competitor does those)
- Explain WHY differences matter for specific use cases
- Include real scenarios and workflows
- Show, do not just tell

### 4. Single Source of Truth
- Centralize competitor data -- do not maintain facts across 10 pages
- Updates propagate to all pages automatically
- Track last-verified date per data point

## The 4 Page Formats

### Format 1: [Competitor] Alternative (Singular)

**Intent:** User is actively looking to switch FROM a specific competitor.

**URL:** `/alternatives/[competitor]` or `/[competitor]-alternative`

**Keywords:** "[Competitor] alternative", "alternative to [Competitor]", "switch from [Competitor]"

**Page Structure:**

```
1. Why people look for alternatives (validate their pain, 2-3 paragraphs)
2. TL;DR: You as the alternative (quick positioning, 3-4 bullets)
3. Detailed comparison (features, pricing, support -- paragraph format, not just tables)
4. Who should switch (and who should NOT -- be honest)
5. Migration path (what transfers, what needs reconfiguration)
6. Testimonials from customers who switched
7. CTA: Start free trial or request demo
```

### Format 2: [Competitor] Alternatives (Plural)

**Intent:** User is researching options broadly, earlier in the buying journey.

**URL:** `/alternatives/[competitor]-alternatives` or `/best-[competitor]-alternatives`

**Keywords:** "[Competitor] alternatives", "best [Competitor] alternatives", "tools like [Competitor]"

**Page Structure:**

```
1. Why people look for alternatives (common pain points, 2-3 paragraphs)
2. What to look for in an alternative (evaluation criteria framework)
3. List of 5-7 alternatives (you first, but include real options)
4. Summary comparison table
5. Detailed breakdown of each alternative (150-200 words each)
6. Recommendation by use case ("Best for [X]: [Tool]")
7. CTA
```

**Important:** Include 5-7 REAL alternatives. Being genuinely helpful ranks better and builds trust.

### Format 3: You vs [Competitor]

**Intent:** User is directly comparing you to a specific competitor.

**URL:** `/vs/[competitor]` or `/compare/[you]-vs-[competitor]`

**Keywords:** "[You] vs [Competitor]", "[Competitor] vs [You]"

**Page Structure:**

```
1. TL;DR summary (key differences in 2-3 sentences)
2. At-a-glance comparison table (8-12 dimensions)
3. Detailed comparison by category (paragraph format per category):
   - Features
   - Pricing
   - Ease of use / UX
   - Support and documentation
   - Integrations
   - Security and compliance
4. Who [You] is best for (3-4 bullets)
5. Who [Competitor] is best for (3-4 bullets -- be honest)
6. What customers say (testimonials from switchers)
7. Migration support
8. CTA
```

### Format 4: [Competitor A] vs [Competitor B]

**Intent:** User is comparing two competitors (neither is you directly).

**URL:** `/compare/[competitor-a]-vs-[competitor-b]`

**Page Structure:**

```
1. Overview of both products (neutral, factual)
2. Comparison by category (same categories as Format 3)
3. Who each is best for
4. "Consider a third option" (introduce yourself naturally)
5. Three-way comparison table (both competitors + you)
6. CTA
```

**Why this works:** Captures competitor-branded search traffic, positions you as a knowledgeable authority, and introduces you to buyers who might not have considered you.

## Research Methodology

### Deep Research Process

For each competitor:

1. **Sign up and use the product** -- Create a real account, go through onboarding, test core workflows. There is no substitute for hands-on experience.
2. **Pricing verification** -- Screenshot current pricing page. Note what is included at each tier. Check for hidden costs.
3. **Review mining** -- Read 50+ reviews on G2, Capterra, TrustRadius. Categorize into praise themes, complaint themes, and feature requests.
4. **Customer feedback** -- Talk to your customers who switched from (or to) this competitor. Capture switching reasons and experience quotes.
5. **Content audit** -- Review their positioning, their comparison pages about you (if any), their changelog, their blog.
6. **Financial/growth signals** -- Check Crunchbase for funding, LinkedIn for employee count trends, job postings for strategic direction.

### Verification Schedule

| Frequency | What to Verify |
|-----------|---------------|
| Monthly | Pricing (check for changes) |
| Quarterly | Feature set, major product updates |
| When notified | Customer reports competitor change |
| Annually | Full refresh of all competitor data |

---

## Essential Content Sections

### TL;DR Summary

Every comparison page starts with a 2-3 sentence summary for scanners. This is the most-read section.

**Template:** "[Your product] is the better choice if you need [differentiator 1] and [differentiator 2]. [Competitor] is better if [their strength]. The biggest differences are [difference 1] and [difference 2]."

### Paragraph Comparisons (Not Just Tables)

For each comparison dimension, write a paragraph explaining:
- How each product handles this area
- Why the differences matter
- Who the difference matters most to

**Tables complement paragraphs. They do not replace them.**

### Pricing Comparison

Include:
- Tier-by-tier price comparison
- What is included at each tier (not just the name)
- Hidden costs (setup fees, overage charges, add-on pricing)
- Total cost calculation for a sample team size (e.g., "For a team of 10")

### Who It Is For

Be explicit about ideal customer for each option:

| Product | Best For | Not Ideal For |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Your product | [Specific persona/use case] | [Honest admission of limitations] |
| Competitor | [Specific persona/use case] | [Their documented weaknesses] |

### Migration Section

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| What transfers | Data, settings, integrations that migrate |
| What needs reconfiguration | What must be set up fresh |
| Support offered | Migration assistance, documentation |
| Estimated time | "Most teams migrate in [timeframe]" |
| Customer quote | Quote from someone who switched |

## SEO Strategy

### Keyword Targeting

| Format | Primary Keywords | Secondary Keywords |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Singular alternative | "[Competitor] alternative" | "switch from [Competitor]", "replace [Competitor]" |
| Plural alternatives | "[Competitor] alternatives" | "best [Competitor] alternatives", "tools like [Competitor]" |
| Vs page | "[You] vs [Competitor]" | "[Competitor] vs [You]", "[You] or [Competitor]" |
| Competitor vs competitor | "[A] vs [B]" | "[B] vs [A]", "[A] or [B]" |

### On-Page SEO

- Title tag: "[Your Product] vs [Competitor]: Detailed Comparison [Year]"
- Meta description: Summarize the key difference and who each is best for
- H1: Match the primary keyword
- Schema: Consider FAQPage schema for comparison questions

### Internal Linking

- Link between all competitor pages (alternative <-> vs page for same competitor)
- Link from feature pages to relevant comparisons
- Link from blog posts mentioning competitors
- Create a hub page: `/compare/` or `/alternatives/` linking to all comparison content

---

## Maintenance and Updates

### Update Triggers

| Trigger | Action | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Competitor changes pricing | Update pricing comparison on all affected pages | High |
| Competitor launches major feature | Update feature comparison + add "Recent Changes" note | High |
| Your product launches feature that closes a gap | Update comparison to reflect new advantage | High |
| New customer switching testimonial | Add to relevant comparison pages | Medium |
| Quarterly review cycle | Verify all data points, refresh screenshots | Medium |

### Freshness Signals

- Include "Last updated: [Month Year]" on every comparison page
- Update the date only when actual content changes are made
- Add "Recent changes" section at the top when a competitor makes significant updates

---

## Quality Standards

### Legal Safety

- All claims must be verifiable from public sources or customer quotes
- Do not make claims about competitor uptime, reliability, or security that you cannot verify
- Use "at the time of writing" or "as of [date]" for factual claims
- Do not copy competitor content -- summarize and analyze

### Credibility Rules

- Acknowledge genuine competitor strengths (do not be a hit piece)
- Include "Who [Competitor] is best for" -- this builds trust
- Use customer quotes from both sides (your customers AND competitor reviews)
- Cite sources for data claims (review platforms, pricing pages, public reports)
- Do not use aggressive language or disparaging tone

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Comparison pages not ranking for target keywords | Thin content or poor on-page SEO | Add 1500+ words of paragraph content (not just tables); ensure H1 matches primary keyword; add FAQ with schema markup |
| Pages rank but do not convert | Missing CTA or weak value proposition | Add CTA after every major section; include migration section and risk reversal (free trial, no CC); use comparison_content_scorer.py to audit |
| Competitor data becomes outdated quickly | No update process in place | Use competitor_data_tracker.py with --stale-days 30 for pricing, 90 for features; assign ownership for monthly checks |
| Sales team does not use comparison content | Pages are too marketing-focused | Create sales-specific versions with objection handling, landmine questions, and talk tracks; test with 3 reps before publishing |
| Legal pushback on competitor claims | Unverifiable or aggressive claims | Cite public sources for every claim; use "as of [date]" qualifiers; acknowledge competitor strengths honestly |
| Too many competitors to cover | Trying to create pages for every competitor | Prioritize using comparison_page_planner.py; start with top 3-5 competitors by search volume and deal frequency |

---

## Success Criteria

- Comparison pages ranking on page 1 for "[competitor] alternative" within 6 months
- Each comparison page converts at 3%+ (visitor to CTA click)
- All competitor data verified within the last 90 days (use competitor_data_tracker.py)
- Pages include honest "Who [Competitor] is best for" section (builds trust, reduces bounce)
- At least 1 customer testimonial from a switcher per comparison page
- Hub page links to all comparison content with clear navigation
- Quarterly content refresh with "Last updated" date on every page

---

## Scope & Limitations

- **In scope:** Comparison page content strategy, SEO optimization, competitor data management, content quality scoring, page planning and prioritization
- **Out of scope:** Primary competitive intelligence gathering (use competitive-teardown), paid advertising strategy, design/development of pages
- **Legal constraint:** All claims must be verifiable from public sources; avoid disparaging competitors; include "as of [date]" for factual claims
- **SEO timeline:** Comparison pages typically take 3-6 months to rank; plan for long-term investment
- **Maintenance cost:** Each competitor page requires ongoing updates; budget for quarterly refreshes

---

## Integration Points

- **competitive-teardown** -- Teardown provides the raw competitive intelligence; this skill transforms it into marketing content
- **page-cro** -- Use for optimizing comparison page conversion rates after content is published
- **seo-audit** -- Use to validate comparison pages meet technical SEO requirements before publishing
- **content-creator** -- Use for writing supporting blog content (competitor comparison blog posts, switching guides)
- **customer-success-manager** -- When customers mention competitor evaluation, comparison pages can be shared proactively
