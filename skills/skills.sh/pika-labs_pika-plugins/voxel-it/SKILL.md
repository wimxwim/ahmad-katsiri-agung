# voxel-it

One skill, one engine: turn a photo into a Minecraft screenshot where the
**human stays photoreal** and the rest of the frame becomes **voxel blocks**,
unified by a cinematic color grade. A **Step 0 router** reads the photo and picks
**one of three modes** — deciding *what* gets voxelized (the featured object, the
background, or everything except the person) and whether to float **Minecraft
"loot tags"** naming the hero objects. This one skill absorbs both the old
**Minecraft-Food** trend (object-only) and the old **Minecraft-World** trend
(object+background).

The conversion engine is the **@rohxit7 viral recipe**, verbatim (Instagram, 194K
likes, #minecraft #prompt #chatgpt). The object-only prompt and loot-tag clause
are salvaged from the retired **Minecraft-Food** trend (@aibyjoe "Minecraft
Food").

**The effect, precisely:**

1. **Keep photorealistic & untouched — the PERSON** (face, skin, hair, clothing,
   pose, proportions). No stylization, no blockifying — in every mode.
2. **Convert to Minecraft — the parts the chosen mode targets** (some subset of:
   terrain, structures, plants, objects, furniture, vehicles, food, drinks, sky,
   background): clean cubic/voxel geometry, crisp 16×16-style textures,
   modern-Minecraft-screenshot quality (premium SEUS/BSL shaders — realistic
   light, soft shadows, AO, volumetric light, sharp edges).
3. **Spatial fidelity (strict):** exact camera, framing, composition; every
   element in its original position and size; nothing added/removed/rearranged.
4. **Cinematic color grade (the unifier):** analyze the source mood and grade the
   whole frame to match, cohesive across real human + voxel world so it's one
   image, not a pasted cutout.
5. **(Conditional) Loot tags** — object-only mode only; see Step 0.

> **Identity note:** maskless single full-canvas edit (per the recipe), so the
> face is *regenerated* and can drift slightly. Accepted for color cohesion. For
> a byte-perfect face, see the advanced mask note at the bottom.

## Step 0 — Router: pick the MODE

Read the photo and commit to exactly ONE mode. **State the decision as a single
line — `MODE: object-only` / `MODE: background-only` / `MODE: object+background`
— then apply the matching prompt block in Step 3.** The engine, color grade, and
quality bar are identical across modes; the only delta is *what* voxelizes and
whether loot tags float.

The three modes:

- **object-only** — voxelize ONLY the held/featured object (food / drink /
  product) **and its own tableware**. Keep the **PERSON** and the **BACKGROUND**
  fully photorealistic. Float a Minecraft loot-tag label above each hero object.
  *(This is the old Minecraft-Food look.)*
- **background-only** — voxelize the **BACKGROUND / environment** into Minecraft
  blocks. Keep the **PERSON** photorealistic; if an incidental object is present,
  keep it photoreal too. **No loot tags.** *(A person standing in a place, now in
  a voxel world — but anything they're holding stays real.)*
- **object+background** — voxelize **EVERYTHING except the person** (the object
  AND the background). Loot tags optional. *(The old full-voxelize Minecraft-World
  default.)*

**Decision tree (default detection):**

```
Does the user EXPLICITLY ask to voxelize everything?
  ("voxelize everything" / "object and background" / "full voxel world")
    → MODE: object+background
Else, is a human FACE or BODY present?
    ├─ Person present + a held/featured object (food/product) is the subject?
    │     → MODE: object-only        (float loot tags on the object)
    └─ Person present, NO featured object (people-in-a-place shot)?
          → MODE: background-only     (the default for face-in-a-scene shots)
No person present?
    ├─ Pure object shot (a meal, a product, a flat-lay, a desk of gear)?
    │     → MODE: object-only
    └─ Landscape / scene with no featured object?
          → MODE: background-only
Genuinely ambiguous (can't tell if the object or the scene is the point)?
    → ask the user ONE line: "voxelize just the object, just the background,
      or everything but you?"
```

The routing intent: a **face with no featured object defaults to
background-only** (put the person in a voxel world, keep them and anything
incidental real). A **featured object → object-only** (voxelize the hero item,
tag it, keep person + scene real). **object+background only on an explicit
request.**

## Inputs

- `<source>` — any photo (path, URL, or chat-pasted image). Works on object
  shots, person+object shots, and wide scenes alike.

## Empty-args menu

1. "Drop the photo (path, URL, or paste it). I'll auto-pick the mode — object-only
   (voxelize just the food/product you're featuring, with Minecraft loot tags),
   background-only (voxelize the scene around you, keep you and anything you're
   holding real), or object+background (voxelize everything but you). Tell me if
   you want to force a specific mode."

(No provider question — always gpt-image-2; see Engine.)

## Engine — always `gpt-image-2`

`gpt-image-2`, `quality="high"`, `output_format="png"`. It's the strong editor the
recipe needs and commits the world to blocks. **Do not use nano-banana-pro** — it
*under-voxelizes* (preserves subjects as photoreal even when told to block-ify),
so the world barely changes (audited over a 6-scene batch).

**Timeout gotcha:** at `quality="high"` a synchronous call often exceeds the
~260s tool budget and the client times out. Always call with `background:true`
and poll `task_status(task_id)` in a tight loop until `completed`.

## Workflow

Working dir: `<project>/voxel-it/<run-id>/` — each run its own folder.

### Step 1 — Get the source as a Pika-CDN URL

- **HTTPS URL?** Use it directly.
- **Local file?** Upload (Step 2). Convert HEIC: `sips -s format jpeg in.HEIC
  --out out.jpg`. iPhone photos often have **no EXIF orientation** but sideways
  pixels — view first, rotate upright with `sips -r 90` (CW) before uploading.
- **Chat-pasted image?** Not reliably on disk. If the user names a file (e.g. a
  Desktop screenshot — macOS uses a narrow no-break space U+202F before AM/PM, so
  match via a glob), copy it. Otherwise extract from the session transcript:

  ```bash
  cd ~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/
  SRC=$(ls -t *.jsonl | head -1)   # newest = current session
  python3 - "$SRC" "<run-dir>" <<'PY'
  import json, base64, sys, os, hashlib
  src, out = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]; imgs=[]
  for line in open(src):
      try: o=json.loads(line)
      except: continue
      m=o.get("message") if isinstance(o,dict) else None
      role=(m or {}).get("role") if isinstance(m,dict) else o.get("role")
      if role!="user": continue
      c=(m or o).get("content")
      if not isinstance(c,list): continue
      for p in c:
          if isinstance(p,dict) and p.get("type")=="image" and isinstance(p.get("source"),dict):
              s=p["source"]
              if s.get("data") and s.get("media_type","").startswith("image/"):
                  imgs.append((s["media_type"], s["data"]))
  # save the last N pasted images (newest turn). Adjust [-1:] to [-N:] for batches.
  for i,(mt,data) in enumerate(imgs[-1:], 1):
      b=base64.b64decode(data); ext={"image/webp":"webp","image/jpeg":"jpg","image/png":"png"}.get(mt,"jpg")
      p=os.path.join(out,f"source_{i}.{ext}"); open(p,"wb").write(b)
      print(p, len(b), "sha256", hashlib.sha256(b).hexdigest())
  PY
  ```

  Always **read the saved file back** (view it) before spending a generation.

### Step 2 — Upload to Pika CDN

`mcp__plugin_pika_pika__upload_asset({filename, mime_type, size_bytes, sha256})`
→ PUT the bytes to `presigned_url` with the **exact** `content_type` from the
response (`curl -X PUT -H "content-type: <type>" --upload-file <file>
"<presigned_url>"`, expect `HTTP 200`) → use the returned `public_url`.

### Step 3 — Run the edit (branch on the Step 0 mode)

`mcp__plugin_pika_pika__generate_image` with `provider="gpt-image-2"`,
`quality="high"`, `output_format="png"`, `background=true` (poll), the CDN URL in
`reference_images`, and `aspect_ratio` matched to source orientation (9:16 / 3:4 /
4:3 / 1:1). Fill the COLOR GRADING mood line from your read of the photo.

**Pick the prompt block for the mode you committed to in Step 0.**

---

#### MODE: object+background (voxelize everything except the person)

Use the @rohxit7 recipe verbatim:

> ROLE: You are an expert image-transformation artist specializing in stylized
> photo-to-game-world conversions and cinematic color grading.
>
> TASK: Transform the attached reference photo into a high-quality Minecraft
> screenshot in which the human subject(s) remain fully photorealistic and
> untouched, while everything else in the scene is converted into detailed
> Minecraft block geometry — then apply cinematic color grading derived from the
> original photo's mood.
>
> CORE CONCEPT (the hero idea — do not deviate): A real, photorealistic human
> standing inside a fully voxel/blocky Minecraft world. The contrast between the
> realistic person and the blocky environment is the entire point of this image.
>
> CONVERSION RULES:
> 1. KEEP PHOTOREALISTIC (do NOT alter): the human subject(s) from the reference
> photo; their face, skin, hair, clothing, pose, and proportions; render them
> exactly as they appear — no stylization, no blockifying.
> 2. CONVERT TO MINECRAFT (high-quality block model): all non-human elements —
> terrain, ground, plants, objects, structures, furniture, vehicles, sky, and
> background. Use clean cubic/voxel geometry with crisp 16x16-style block
> textures. Quality reference: a modern Minecraft screenshot rendered with
> premium shaders (e.g., SEUS / BSL style) — realistic lighting, soft shadows,
> ambient occlusion, volumetric light, sharp block edges.
> 3. SPATIAL FIDELITY (strict — this is a conversion, not a reimagining):
> preserve the EXACT camera angle, framing, and composition; keep every element
> in its ORIGINAL position; keep every element at its ORIGINAL relative size and
> scale; the human must occupy the same place and proportion as in the source; do
> NOT add, remove, or rearrange objects.
>
> COLOR GRADING (apply AFTER the Minecraft conversion):
> Step 1 — ANALYZE the original photo first: identify its time of day, lighting
> direction, dominant color palette, warmth/coolness, and overall mood ([fill in
> the mood you read, e.g. "moody night street, cool blue sky with warm street-lamp
> glow" / "golden-hour warm" / "overcast neutral"]).
> Step 2 — APPLY cinematic color grading that matches that analyzed mood: filmic
> contrast curve, balanced highlights and shadows; color tone consistent with the
> original photo's atmosphere; subtle vignette and depth, cohesive across both the
> realistic human and the blocky environment so they feel like one unified image.
>
> OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS: single high-resolution image; sharp, detailed,
> professional Minecraft-screenshot quality; photorealistic human + voxel world,
> seamlessly color-graded.
>
> SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING: Is the human still 100% photorealistic and
> unchanged? Is everything else clearly Minecraft block geometry? Are positions,
> sizes, and composition identical to the source? Does the color grade match the
> original photo's analyzed mood? Does the realistic human and blocky world feel
> unified, not pasted?

**Loot tags in object+background are OPTIONAL.** If the user wants them (or there's
a clear namable hero object), insert the LOOT TAGS block below between CONVERSION
RULES and COLOR GRADING, and add its tag line to TASK + SELF-CHECK:

> LOOT TAGS: above or near EACH hero voxelized object, float a Minecraft
> inventory-style name tag — clean white pixel/bitmap font on a dark
> semi-transparent rounded rectangle (a Minecraft item-tooltip / named-entity
> tag) — naming that item: [list each hero object → its short name, e.g. "Mojito",
> "Sesame Latte", "Apple Cake", "Air Jordan 1", "Leica M6"]. Keep tags tidy,
> crisp, readable, non-overlapping, floating just above each item, and NEVER
> covering a person's face. (add to SELF-CHECK: "Does each hero object have a
> clean, readable Minecraft name tag that doesn't cover a face?")

---

#### MODE: background-only (voxelize the scene, keep the person AND any incidental object real)

Same @rohxit7 recipe as object+background, with **CONVERSION RULE 1 widened** so
the person is not the ONLY thing kept real: also keep any incidental held/foreground
object photorealistic. Concretely, replace RULE 1 and RULE 2 with:

> 1. KEEP PHOTOREALISTIC (do NOT alter): the human subject(s) — face, skin, hair,
> clothing, pose, proportions — AND any object the person is holding or that sits
> in the immediate foreground (a phone, a drink, a bag, a prop). Render all of
> these exactly as they appear — no stylization, no blockifying.
> 2. CONVERT TO MINECRAFT (high-quality block model): the BACKGROUND and
> ENVIRONMENT only — terrain, ground, plants, structures, furniture, vehicles,
> sky, and scenery behind and around the subject. Use clean cubic/voxel geometry
> with crisp 16x16-style block textures. Quality reference: a modern Minecraft
> screenshot with premium shaders (SEUS / BSL) — realistic lighting, soft
> shadows, ambient occlusion, volumetric light, sharp block edges. Do NOT
> voxelize the person or anything they are holding.

Keep CORE CONCEPT, SPATIAL FIDELITY (RULE 3), COLOR GRADING, OUTPUT
SPECIFICATIONS, and SELF-CHECK from the object+background block verbatim (they
apply unchanged). **No loot tags in background-only.**

---

#### MODE: object-only (voxelize just the featured object + its tableware; keep the person AND background real; float loot tags)

This is the retired Minecraft-Food recipe. Fill the bracketed list per item and
keep the KEEP and label clauses verbatim:

> Edit this exact photo. KEEP [the person + their face, hair, hands, clothing,
> accessories /OR for a flat-lay: the table, containers, plates, cups, tray,
> utensils] and the background/scene and lighting 100% PHOTOREALISTIC and
> unchanged — do not stylize [the person] at all.
>
> ONLY transform the FOOD, DRINK and the food's TABLEWARE into 3D Minecraft
> voxel blocks — chunky, low-resolution cube-pixel geometry with flat blocky
> textures, exactly like Minecraft items, each sitting naturally where the real
> item was: [per-item mapping — e.g. "the ramen bowl → a blocky voxel bowl of
> yellow cube-noodles"; "the pepperoni slice → cube crust + voxel cheese + cube
> pepperoni discs"; "the steamed rice → a mound of white voxel rice cubes"].
>
> Above or near EACH transformed item, add a Minecraft inventory-style text
> label: clean white pixel/bitmap font on a dark semi-transparent rounded
> rectangle, naming the item (e.g. [item labels]). Keep labels tidy and
> readable, non-overlapping, and never over [the person's face].
>
> Final look: a real photorealistic [person / scene], but every piece of food,
> drink and tableware is a Minecraft voxel object with floating Minecraft
> inventory labels.

Then apply the **COLOR GRADING** step from the object+background block (analyze
the source mood, grade the whole frame to match) so the voxel object and the real
person/scene read as one image.

**Enumerate before you generate:** the single biggest lever on object-only
quality is naming each food/product item AND the voxel object it should become,
item by item, in the prompt. Read the source and list every dish / drink / utensil
first; generic "turn the food into blocks" is mushy, per-item mapping lands.

---

**Groups:** in any mode, name *every* person in the KEEP clause so none gets
blockified. **Contact objects** (held mug, drink, plate) voxelize with the object
in object-only / object+background, but stay real in background-only.

### Step 4 — Download, show, open (+ rotation check)

Download to `<run-dir>/voxel-it-<subject>.png`, show it, `open` in Finder
(no analyze_media re-check — just look). PNG only unless asked. **Rotation check:**
gpt-image-2 occasionally returns a portrait edit rotated 90° — if sky/ceiling
isn't up, `sips -r 270 file.png --out file.png` (free, no regen). Stills only.

## Tips & failure modes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Output rotated 90° | `sips -r 270 file.png --out file.png` (free, no regen). |
| Person got blockified | Re-assert the KEEP clause; for groups name every person. |
| World barely voxelized | You're on nano-banana-pro — switch to gpt-image-2. |
| Person looks pasted | Make sure the COLOR GRADING block + mood line are present — that's the unifier. |
| Wrong things voxelized | Re-check Step 0 — you picked the wrong mode. object-only = just the featured object; background-only = just the scene; object+background = everything but the person. |
| Object voxelized in background-only | Widen the KEEP clause to name the held/foreground object explicitly. |
| Tags missing / wrong items (object-only) | You forgot the label clause, or didn't list the hero items by name. List each one. |
| Tags messy / overlapping / on the face | "keep labels non-overlapping, just above each item, never over a face"; re-roll. |
| Tags appeared but shouldn't have | You're in background-only (no tags) — drop the label clause. |
| Day-for-night flip | Name the night mood explicitly in COLOR GRADING. |
| Cropped vs source | Match `aspect_ratio` to source orientation. |
| Face drifted | Expected (maskless recipe). Advanced fix below. |

**Advanced — guaranteed identity (off-recipe).** `mcp__plugin_pika_pika__remove_background` (`mode="portrait"`)
on the source → use the alpha as the gpt-image-2 `mask` (transparent=repaint,
opaque=keep) so only the targeted region converts and the person's pixels are
never touched. Off the @rohxit7 path; use only when a face must be byte-perfect.

## Reference

- **Engine:** @rohxit7 viral recipe, verbatim. **object-only prompt + loot tags:**
  salvaged from @aibyjoe "Minecraft Food". This skill **absorbs and retires both
  minecraft-food (object-only) and minecraft-world (object+background)**.
- Verdict: gpt-image-2 always; one recipe, three input-driven modes.
