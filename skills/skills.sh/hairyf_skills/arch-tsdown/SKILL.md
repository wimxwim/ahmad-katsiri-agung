arch-tsdown is a TypeScript library starter (based on antfu/starter-ts) that uses **tsdown** for building. It provides a minimal, opinionated setup: ESM-only output, automatic `.d.ts` generation, pnpm, Vitest, ESLint, and optional npm Trusted Publisher for CI-based releases.

> The skill is based on starter-ts (arch-tsdown source), generated at 2026-01-30.

**Recommended practices:**
- Build pure ESM; enable `dts` and `exports` in tsdown config
- Use npm Trusted Publisher for releases
- Run publint (via tsdown’s `publint: true`) before publishing
