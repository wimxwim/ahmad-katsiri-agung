## Best Practices

1. **Automated checks**: Enforce via CI/CD
2. **Manual review**: Critical deployments need approval
3. **Smoke tests**: Verify key functionality
4. **Gradual rollout**: Canary or blue-green
5. **Monitoring**: Watch metrics for 30 minutes
6. **Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed
7. **Rollback ready**: One-click rollback available
