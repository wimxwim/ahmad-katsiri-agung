# Rust Code Review

## Review Workflow

Follow this sequence to avoid false positives and catch edition-specific issues:

1. **Check `Cargo.toml`** — Note the Rust edition (2018, 2021, 2024) and MSRV if set. Edition 2024 introduces breaking changes to unsafe semantics, RPIT lifetime capture, temporary scoping, and `!` type fallback. This determines which patterns apply. Check workspace structure if present.
2. **Check dependencies** — Note key crates (thiserror vs anyhow, tokio features, serde features). These inform which patterns are expected.
3. **Scan changed files** — Read full functions, not just diffs. Many Rust bugs hide in ownership flow across a function.
4. **Check each category** — Work through the checklist below, loading references as needed.
5. **Verify before reporting** — Complete **Gates** (below), including the verification-protocol gate, before submitting findings.

## Gates

These steps are **sequenced**: do not skip ahead with “mental verification.” Each step has an objective **Pass** you can satisfy from files on disk and your own read path.

1. **Crate context** — Before relying on edition-specific checklist rows (Edition 2024, MSRV-sensitive APIs) or dependency assumptions. **Pass:** You opened the relevant `Cargo.toml` (package or workspace manifest) and can state `edition` and `rust-version` (if set) in one line.
2. **Expanded read** — Before reporting a **Major** or **Critical** finding. **Pass:** You read the full function, `unsafe` block, or `impl` / trait item that contains the cited line (not only a diff hunk).
3. **Severity match** — Before each finding line in the report. **Pass:** The **Severity** label matches **Severity Calibration** for that issue class, or you use **Informational** and give a one-line rationale.
4. **Verification protocol** — Before finalizing the report. **Pass:** the [review-verification-protocol](../review-verification-protocol/SKILL.md) skill is loaded and every step in it that applies to this review is completed (do not substitute a vague “I checked”).

## Review Checklist

### Ownership and Borrowing
- [ ] No unnecessary `.clone()` to silence the borrow checker (hiding design issues)
- [ ] No `.clone()` inside loops — prefer `.cloned()` or `.copied()` on iterators
- [ ] No cloning to avoid lifetime annotations (take ownership explicitly or restructure)
- [ ] References have appropriate lifetimes (not overly broad `'static` when shorter lifetime works)
- [ ] **Edition 2024**: RPIT (`-> impl Trait`) captures all in-scope lifetimes by default; use `+ use<'a>` for precise capture control
- [ ] `&str` preferred over `String`, `&[T]` over `Vec<T>` in function parameters
- [ ] `impl AsRef<T>` or `Into<T>` used for flexible API parameters
- [ ] No dangling references or use-after-move
- [ ] Interior mutability (`Cell`, `RefCell`, `Mutex`) used only when shared mutation is genuinely needed
- [ ] Small types (≤24 bytes) derive `Copy` and are passed by value
- [ ] `Cow<'_, T>` used when ownership is ambiguous
- [ ] Iterator chains preferred over index-based loops for collection transforms
- [ ] No premature `.collect()` — pass iterators directly when the consumer accepts them
- [ ] `.sum()` preferred over `.fold()` for summation (compiler optimizes better)
- [ ] `_or_else` variants used when fallbacks involve allocation
- [ ] **Edition 2024**: `if let` temporaries drop at end of the `if let` — code relying on temporaries living through the else branch needs restructuring
- [ ] **Edition 2024**: `Box<[T]>` implements `IntoIterator` — prefer direct iteration over `into_vec()` first

### Error Handling
- [ ] `Result<T, E>` used for recoverable errors, not `panic!`/`unwrap`/`expect`
- [ ] Error types provide context (thiserror with `#[error("...")]` or manual `Display`)
- [ ] `?` operator used with proper `From` implementations or `.map_err()`
- [ ] `unwrap()` / `expect()` only in tests, examples, or provably-safe contexts
- [ ] Error variants are specific enough to be actionable by callers
- [ ] `anyhow` used in applications, `thiserror` in libraries (or clear rationale for alternatives)
- [ ] `_or_else` variants used when fallbacks involve allocation (`ok_or_else`, `unwrap_or_else`)
- [ ] `let-else` used for early returns on failure (`let Ok(x) = expr else { return ... }`)
- [ ] `inspect_err` used for error logging, `map_err` for error transformation

### Traits and Types
- [ ] Traits are minimal and cohesive (single responsibility)
- [ ] `derive` macros appropriate for the type (`Clone`, `Debug`, `PartialEq` used correctly)
- [ ] Newtypes used to prevent primitive obsession (e.g., `struct UserId(Uuid)` not bare `Uuid`)
- [ ] `From`/`Into` implementations are lossless and infallible; `TryFrom` for fallible conversions
- [ ] Sealed traits used when external implementations shouldn't be allowed
- [ ] Default implementations provided where they make sense
- [ ] `Send + Sync` bounds verified for types shared across threads
- [ ] `#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented]` used on public traits to provide clear error messages when users forget to implement them

### Interface Design
> Detailed guidance: [references/interface-design.md](references/interface-design.md)
- [ ] Methods on `dyn`-intended traits don't use `Self` by value, generic params, or associated constants (or are gated `where Self: Sized`)
- [ ] New traits ship with blanket impls for `&T`, `&mut T`, `Box<T>` so reference and smart-pointer arguments work
- [ ] Iterable types implement `IntoIterator` for `&Self` and `&mut Self`, not just `Self`
- [ ] `Deref` only used for transparent forwarding, never as "inheritance" — inherent-method ambiguity is a real bug class
- [ ] Fallible cleanup uses an explicit `close()`/`shutdown()` returning `Result`; `Drop` is best-effort fallback only
- [ ] No `block_on(...)` or new runtime in `Drop` (deadlock under async runtimes)
- [ ] Public types have a compile-time `fn is_normal<T: Sized + Send + Sync + Unpin>() {}` test so auto-trait regressions surface at build time
- [ ] Re-exported foreign types in public API are flagged — downstream major bumps become this crate's breaking change
- [ ] Getter methods follow the convention `fn name(&self)` not `fn get_name(&self)` (reserve `get_*` for `Option`-returning or interesting lookups)
- [ ] `as_*` is cheap reference-to-reference, `to_*` may allocate, `into_*` consumes — verify the cost matches the prefix
- [ ] Standard derives (`Debug`, `Clone`, `Default`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Hash`) considered for every public type; `Copy` only when truly cheap and value-like (removing it later is breaking)

### Patterns in the Wild
> Detailed guidance: [references/patterns-in-the-wild.md](references/patterns-in-the-wild.md)
- [ ] Index-pointer graphs use generational indices (`slotmap::DefaultKey`, `petgraph::NodeIndex`) — bare `usize` orphans after `Vec::swap_remove`
- [ ] Drop guards bound to `let _guard = ...`, never `let _ = ...` (the second drops immediately, not at scope end)
- [ ] Drop-guard cleanup not relied upon under `panic = "abort"` (destructors do not run)
- [ ] Extension traits used only when the type is foreign; for owned types use inherent `impl` directly
- [ ] Extension-trait methods don't shadow popular existing methods on the same type (ambiguity at call sites)
- [ ] Crate `prelude` module additions treated as semver-minor (RFC 1105); reserve for major releases when possible

### Concurrency Design (Models)
> Detailed guidance: [references/concurrency-models.md](references/concurrency-models.md)
- [ ] Concurrency model (shared memory vs worker pool vs actor) named explicitly in the design; primitives match the model
- [ ] Mutex critical section is short, measurable, and excludes I/O / network calls / `.await` points
- [ ] Worker-pool queues are bounded; backpressure strategy is named
- [ ] Actor mailbox channels are sized to expected load; cross-actor cycles reviewed for deadlock
- [ ] `async` is not conflated with parallelism — `join!` interleaves on one thread; only `tokio::spawn` (or equivalent on a multi-threaded runtime) parallelizes
- [ ] CAS retry loops on a hot atomic considered for replacement with `fetch_add`/sharding (CAS is O(N²) under contention)
- [ ] `println!` / `dbg!` not used as a debugging tool for race conditions (the Stdout mutex changes the race)

### Unsafe Code
- [ ] `unsafe` blocks have safety comments explaining invariants
- [ ] `unsafe` is minimal — only the truly unsafe operation is inside the block
- [ ] Safety invariants are documented and upheld by surrounding safe code
- [ ] No undefined behavior (null pointer deref, data races, invalid memory access)
- [ ] `unsafe` trait implementations justify why the contract is upheld
- [ ] **Edition 2024**: `unsafe fn` bodies use explicit `unsafe {}` blocks around unsafe ops (`unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` is deny)
- [ ] **Edition 2024**: `extern "C" {}` blocks written as `unsafe extern "C" {}`
- [ ] **Edition 2024**: `#[no_mangle]` and `#[export_name]` written as `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` and `#[unsafe(export_name)]`

### Concurrency (Memory Ordering and Lock-Free Patterns)
> Detailed guidance: [references/memory-ordering.md](references/memory-ordering.md), [references/lock-free-patterns.md](references/lock-free-patterns.md)
- [ ] Types shared across threads have correct `Send` / `Sync` bounds; `unsafe impl Send/Sync` carries a comment naming the invariant
- [ ] Each atomic operation pairs with a named happens-before edge (spawn/join, `Release`/`Acquire` on the same atomic, or a fence); `Release` publishes data, `Acquire` observes it
- [ ] No `SeqCst` by default — only when two or more independent atomics need a single global total order, with a comment naming the requirement
- [ ] No `store(.., Acquire)` / `load(.., Release)` / `load(.., AcqRel)` (rejected by the type half they occupy)
- [ ] `Relaxed` not used to publish or observe non-atomic data (use `Release` / `Acquire`)
- [ ] `compare_exchange_weak` used inside retry loops; strong `compare_exchange` reserved for one-shot updates; success ordering at least `Acquire` when acquiring a critical section
- [ ] Hand-rolled spinlocks include `std::hint::spin_loop()` in the busy wait, exponential backoff, and an eventual `thread::yield_now()`; not used in normal user-space binaries without a documented reason a `Mutex` is unsuitable
- [ ] Hand-rolled `Arc` clones with `Relaxed`, drops with `Release` + `fence(Acquire)` on the last decrement, and includes an overflow guard
- [ ] `Arc<Mutex<...>>` cycles broken with `Weak`; `Arc<Mutex<Copy>>` reviewed for `Arc<AtomicT>` replacement
- [ ] Hand-rolled lock-free primitives have a `#[cfg(loom)]` test module and a Miri-runnable test (no blanket `cfg_attr(miri, ignore)`)
- [ ] `OnceLock` / `LazyLock` preferred over `once_cell` / `lazy_static` for new code (MSRV ≥ 1.80)
- [ ] No `MutexGuard` held across `.await` (use `tokio::sync::Mutex` or drop the guard first)
- [ ] Hot atomics on contended cache lines wrapped with `CachePadded` or `#[repr(align(64))]` to avoid false sharing
- [ ] Shared mutation goes through `UnsafeCell<T>` (not bare `*mut T` or transmuted `&` to `&mut`)
- [ ] Pointer-based CAS (`AtomicPtr<Node>`) uses epoch / hazard-pointer / tagged-pointer reclamation; ABA hazards considered

### Naming and Style
- [ ] Types are `PascalCase`, functions/methods `snake_case`, constants `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- [ ] Modules use `snake_case`
- [ ] `is_`, `has_`, `can_` prefixes for boolean-returning methods
- [ ] Builder pattern methods take and return `self` (not `&mut self`) for chaining
- [ ] Public items have doc comments (`///`)
- [ ] `#[must_use]` on functions where ignoring the return value is likely a bug
- [ ] Imports ordered: std → external crates → workspace → crate/super
- [ ] `#[expect(clippy::...)]` preferred over `#[allow(...)]` for lint suppression

### Performance
> Detailed guidance: the [rust-best-practices](../rust-best-practices/SKILL.md) skill (`references/performance.md`)
- [ ] No unnecessary allocations in hot paths (prefer `&str` over `String`, `&[T]` over `Vec<T>`)
- [ ] `collect()` type is specified or inferable
- [ ] Iterators preferred over indexed loops for collection transforms
- [ ] `Vec::with_capacity()` used when size is known
- [ ] No redundant `.to_string()` / `.to_owned()` chains
- [ ] No intermediate `.collect()` when passing iterators directly works
- [ ] `.sum()` preferred over `.fold()` for summation
- [ ] Static dispatch (`impl Trait`) used over dynamic (`dyn Trait`) unless flexibility required

### Clippy Configuration
> Detailed guidance: the [rust-best-practices](../rust-best-practices/SKILL.md) skill (`references/clippy-config.md`)
- [ ] Workspace-level lints configured in `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.lints.clippy]` or `[lints.clippy]`)
- [ ] `#[expect(clippy::lint)]` used over `#[allow(...)]` — warns when suppression becomes stale
- [ ] Justification comment present when suppressing any lint
- [ ] Key lints enforced: `redundant_clone`, `large_enum_variant`, `needless_collect`, `perf` group
- [ ] `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` passes
- [ ] Doc lints enabled for library crates (`missing_docs`, `broken_intra_doc_links`)

### Type State Pattern
> Detailed guidance: the [rust-best-practices](../rust-best-practices/SKILL.md) skill (`references/type-state-pattern.md`)
- [ ] `PhantomData<State>` used for zero-cost compile-time state machines (not runtime enums/booleans)
- [ ] State transitions consume `self` and return new state type (prevents reuse of old state)
- [ ] Only applicable methods available per state (invalid operations are compile errors)
- [ ] Pattern used where it adds safety value (builders with required fields, connection states, workflows)
- [ ] Not overused for trivial state (simple enums are fine when runtime flexibility needed)

## Severity Calibration

### Critical (Block Merge)
- `unsafe` code with unsound invariants or undefined behavior
- Use-after-free or dangling reference patterns
- `unwrap()` on user input or external data in production code
- Data races (concurrent mutation without synchronization)
- Wrong memory ordering on an atomic that gates other shared data (data race)
- Memory leaks via circular `Arc<Mutex<...>>` without weak references

### Major (Should Fix)
- Errors returned without context (bare `return err` equivalent)
- `.clone()` masking ownership design issues in hot paths
- Missing `Send`/`Sync` bounds on types used across threads
- `panic!` for recoverable errors in library code
- Overly broad `'static` lifetimes hiding API design issues

### Minor (Consider Fixing)
- Missing doc comments on public items
- `String` parameter where `&str` or `impl AsRef<str>` would work
- Derive macros missing for types that should have them
- Unused feature flags in `Cargo.toml`
- Suboptimal iterator chains (multiple allocations where one suffices)

### Informational (Note Only)
- Suggestions to introduce newtypes for domain modeling
- Refactoring ideas for trait design
- Performance optimizations without measured impact
- Suggestions to add `#[must_use]` or `#[non_exhaustive]`

## Valid Patterns (Do NOT Flag)

These are acceptable Rust patterns — reporting them wastes developer time:

- **`.clone()` in tests** — Clarity over performance in test code
- **`unwrap()` in tests and examples** — Acceptable where panicking on failure is intentional
- **`Box<dyn Error>` in simple binaries** — Not every application needs custom error types
- **`String` fields in structs** — Owned data in structs is correct; `&str` fields require lifetime parameters
- **`#[allow(dead_code)]` during development** — Common during iteration
- **`todo!()` / `unimplemented!()` in new code** — Valid placeholder during active development
- **`.expect("reason")` with clear message** — Self-documenting and acceptable for invariants
- **`use super::*` in test modules** — Standard pattern for `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- **Type aliases for complex types** — `type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, MyError>` is idiomatic
- **`impl Trait` in return position** — Zero-cost abstraction, standard pattern
- **Turbofish syntax** — `collect::<Vec<_>>()` is idiomatic when type inference needs help
- **`_` prefix for intentionally unused variables** — Compiler convention
- **`#[expect(clippy::...)]` with justification** — Self-cleaning lint suppression
- **`Arc::clone(&arc)`** — Explicit Arc cloning is idiomatic and recommended
- **`std::sync::Mutex` for short critical sections in async** — Tokio docs recommend this
- **`for` loops over iterators** — When early exit or side effects are needed
- **`async fn` in trait definitions** — Stable since 1.75; `async-trait` crate only needed for `dyn Trait` or pre-1.75 MSRV
- **`LazyCell` / `LazyLock` from std** — Stable since 1.80; replaces `once_cell` and `lazy_static` for new code
- **`+ use<'a, T>` precise capture syntax** — Edition 2024 syntax for controlling RPIT lifetime capture

## Context-Sensitive Rules

Only flag these issues when the specific conditions apply:

| Issue | Flag ONLY IF |
|-------|--------------|
| Missing error context | Error crosses module boundary without context |
| Unnecessary `.clone()` | In hot path or repeated call, not test/setup code |
| Missing doc comments | Item is `pub` and not in a `#[cfg(test)]` module |
| `unwrap()` usage | In production code path, not test/example/provably-safe |
| Missing `Send + Sync` | Type is actually shared across thread/task boundaries |
| Overly broad lifetime | A shorter lifetime would work AND the API is public |
| Missing `#[must_use]` | Function returns a value that callers commonly ignore |
| Stale `#[allow]` suppression | Should be `#[expect]` for self-cleaning lint management |
| Missing `Copy` derive | Type is ≤24 bytes with all-Copy fields and used frequently |
| **Edition 2024**: `!` type fallback | Match on `Result<T, !>` or diverging expressions where `()` fallback was assumed — `!` now falls back to `!` not `()` |
| **Edition 2024**: `r#gen` identifier | Code uses `gen` as an identifier — must be `r#gen` in edition 2024 (reserved keyword) |
