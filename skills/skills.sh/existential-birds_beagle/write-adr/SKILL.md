# Write ADR

Generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) from decisions made during the current session.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Context** - Gather repository context and existing ADRs
2. **Extract** - Analyze conversation for decisions using a subagent
3. **Confirm** - Present decisions to user for selection
4. **Write** - Generate ADRs in parallel using subagents
5. **Report** - Summarize created files and status
6. **Verify** - Validate generated ADRs against Definition of Done

### Gates (objective pass conditions)

Advance only when the **pass condition** holds. These are checkable without “I verified internally.”

| After | Pass condition |
|-------|----------------|
| Step 2 (extract) | The subagent response is **valid JSON** with a top-level `decisions` **array** (empty is OK). Each non-empty item has `id`, `title`, and at least one of `context`, `decision`, `alternatives`, or `rationale` present as a non-empty string or non-empty array. If parsing fails or the shape is wrong, **re-run extraction or fix the payload** before Step 3. |
| Step 4 (pre-allocate) | From repo root, `python plugins/beagle-analysis/skills/adr-writing/scripts/next_adr_number.py --count N` prints **exactly `N` lines** (one number per line). You have a **written mapping** (in the reply draft or notes) from each selected decision to one of those lines **before** launching any ADR writer unit. |
| Step 5 (report) | Every file path in the summary table is copied from a subagent completion output (not invented). Optionally **spot-check**: `test -f <path>` for each path before marking success. |
| Step 6 (verify) | For each ADR path, opening the file shows **line 1 is `---`**, frontmatter parses as YAML, `status` and `date` are present, and the body meets the Step 6 bullets below (alternatives count, Good/Bad consequences). |

## Step 1: Gather Context

```bash
# Get current branch and recent commits
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline -5

# Check for existing ADRs
ls docs/adrs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No ADR directory found"

# Count existing ADRs for numbering
find docs/adrs -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

This context helps the ADR writer:
- Reference related commits in the ADR
- Avoid duplicate ADRs for already-documented decisions
- Determine correct sequence numbering

## Step 2: Extract Decisions

Analyze the current conversation for architectural decisions. **If the agent supports subagents**, dispatch this as a single extraction subagent; **otherwise** run the same extraction inline — identical output. Use this brief:

```text
Load the **adr-decision-extraction** skill ([../adr-decision-extraction/SKILL.md](../adr-decision-extraction/SKILL.md)).

Analyze the conversation for decisions that warrant ADRs:
- Technology choices, architecture patterns, design trade-offs
- Rejected alternatives, significant implementation approaches

Return JSON:
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Use PostgreSQL for primary datastore",
      "context": "Brief context about why this came up",
      "decision": "What was decided",
      "alternatives": ["What was considered but rejected"],
      "rationale": "Why this choice was made"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the subagent returns an empty `decisions` array, skip to Step 5 with message: "No architectural decisions detected in this session."

**Gate:** Meet the Step 2 row in **Gates (objective pass conditions)** before Step 3.

## Step 3: Confirm with User

**Display all extracted decisions with full details**, then ask user to select:

```text
## Detected Decisions

### 1. Use PostgreSQL for primary datastore
**Confidence:** high

**Problem:** Need ACID transactions for financial records

**Decision:** PostgreSQL for user data storage

**Alternatives discussed:**
- MongoDB
- SQLite

**Rationale:** ACID compliance, team familiarity, mature ecosystem

**Source:** Discussion about database selection in planning phase

---

### 2. Implement event sourcing for audit trail
**Confidence:** medium

**Problem:** Compliance requires complete audit history

**Decision:** Event sourcing pattern for state changes

**Alternatives discussed:**
- Database triggers
- Application-level logging

**Rationale:** Immutable audit trail, temporal queries, debugging capability

**Source:** Compliance requirements discussion

---

## Selection

Which decisions should I write ADRs for?
- Enter numbers (e.g., "1,2" or "1-2"), "all", or "none" to skip
```

**Important:** Always display the full decision details (problem, decision, alternatives, rationale) from the extraction output BEFORE asking for selection. Do not truncate to just title and context.

Parse user response:
- `"all"` - Process all decisions
- `"none"` or empty - Skip with message "No ADRs will be created."
- `"1,2"` or `"1-2"` - Process specified decisions

## Step 4: Write ADRs (Parallel)

**Pre-allocate ADR numbers before launching subagents** to prevent numbering conflicts:

```bash
# Pre-allocate numbers for all confirmed decisions (from repository root)
# Example: If user selected 3 decisions
python plugins/beagle-analysis/skills/adr-writing/scripts/next_adr_number.py --count 3
# Output:
# 0003
# 0004
# 0005
```

**Assign each pre-allocated number to its corresponding decision** before launching subagents.

**Gate:** Meet the Step 4 row in **Gates (objective pass conditions)** before launching the first ADR writer unit.

For each confirmed decision, run an ADR writer unit with its **pre-assigned number**. **If the agent supports subagents**, dispatch one writer per decision in parallel; **otherwise** write each ADR sequentially — identical output. Use this brief:

```text
Load the **adr-writing** skill ([../adr-writing/SKILL.md](../adr-writing/SKILL.md)).

Write an ADR for this decision:
```json
{decision JSON}
```

**IMPORTANT: Use this pre-assigned ADR number: {assigned_number}**

Instructions:
1. Explore codebase for additional context
2. Write MADR-formatted ADR to docs/adrs/
3. Use the pre-assigned number {assigned_number} - DO NOT call next_adr_number.py
4. Filename format: {assigned_number}-slugified-title.md
5. Return created file path
```

**Critical:** Pass the pre-allocated number to each writer unit. Writers must NOT call `next_adr_number.py` themselves - this causes duplicate numbers when running in parallel.

Wait for all writer units to complete before proceeding.

## Step 5: Report Results

**Gate:** Meet the Step 5 row in **Gates (objective pass conditions)** when building the summary (paths from subagent outputs; optional `test -f`).

Collect outputs from all subagents and present summary:

```markdown
## ADR Generation Complete

| File | Decision | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| docs/adrs/0003-use-postgresql.md | Use PostgreSQL for primary datastore | Draft |

### Next Steps
- Review generated ADRs for accuracy
- Update status from "proposed" to "accepted" when finalized

### Gaps Requiring Investigation
- [List any decisions where subagent noted missing context]
```

If no decisions were processed:
```text
No ADRs were created. Run this command again after making architectural decisions.
```

## Step 6: Verify Generated ADRs

For each created ADR, validate against Definition of Done:

```markdown
## Verification Checklist

| ADR | E | C | A | D | R | Status |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|--------|
| 0003-use-postgresql.md | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ | ✗ | Incomplete |

Legend: E=Evidence, C=Criteria, A=Agreement, D=Documentation, R=Realization
```

**Gate:** Meet the Step 6 row in **Gates (objective pass conditions)** for every created ADR.

**Verification steps:**
1. Open each generated ADR file
2. Confirm filename follows `NNNN-slugified-title.md` pattern
3. **Verify YAML frontmatter exists at file start:**
   - File MUST begin with `---`
   - Contains `status: draft` (or valid status)
   - Contains `date: YYYY-MM-DD` (actual date)
   - Ends with `---` before title
   - If frontmatter is missing, add it immediately
4. Review for `[INVESTIGATE]` prompts - these need follow-up
5. Verify at least 2 alternatives are documented
6. Confirm consequences section has both Good and Bad items

**If gaps exist:**
- Keep status as `draft` until gaps are resolved
- Use `[INVESTIGATE]` prompts to guide follow-up session
- Schedule review with stakeholders before changing to `accepted`

## Output Location

ADRs are written to `docs/adrs/` (same convention as [adr-writing](../adr-writing/SKILL.md)). If no ADR directory exists, create it with an initial `0000-use-madr.md` template record.

## MADR Format Reference

```markdown
---
status: draft
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# {TITLE}

## Context and Problem Statement

{What is the issue motivating this decision?}

## Decision Drivers

* {driver 1}
* {driver 2}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{option}", because {reason}.

### Consequences
