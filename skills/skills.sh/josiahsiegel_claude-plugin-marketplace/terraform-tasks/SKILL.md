# Terraform Tasks Skill

## 🚨 CRITICAL GUIDELINES

### Windows File Path Requirements

**MANDATORY: Always Use Backslashes on Windows for File Paths**

When using Edit or Write tools on Windows, you MUST use backslashes (`\`) in file paths, NOT forward slashes (`/`).

**Examples:**
- ❌ WRONG: `D:/repos/project/file.tsx`
- ✅ CORRECT: `D:\repos\project\file.tsx`

This applies to:
- Edit tool file_path parameter
- Write tool file_path parameter
- All file operations on Windows systems

### Documentation Guidelines

**NEVER create new documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.**

- **Priority**: Update existing README.md files rather than creating new documentation
- **Repository cleanliness**: Keep repository root clean - only README.md unless user requests otherwise
- **Style**: Documentation should be concise, direct, and professional - avoid AI-generated tone
- **User preference**: Only create additional .md files when user specifically asks for documentation

4. Generate fixes
5. Explain security implications

**Example Tasks**:
- "Run tfsec and fix all HIGH severity issues"

- "Implement Azure storage account with all security best practices"

### 5. Architecture Review

Review and improve Terraform architecture:

**Process**:
1. Analyze current structure
2. Identify anti-patterns
3. Propose improvements
4. Generate refactoring plan
5. Document decisions (ADRs)

**Example Tasks**:
- "Review state management strategy for 500+ resources"
- "Design multi-region architecture for high availability"
- "Refactor monolithic state into layered approach"

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline Generation

Create complete CI/CD pipelines:

**Process**:
1. Determine CI/CD platform
2. Understand environment strategy
3. Generate pipeline configuration
4. Include security scanning
5. Add approval gates
6. Implement drift detection

**Example Tasks**:
- "Create Azure DevOps pipeline with multi-stage deployment"
- "Generate GitHub Actions workflow with OIDC authentication"
- "Build GitLab CI pipeline with Terraform Cloud backend"

### 7. Module Development

Create reusable Terraform modules:

**Process**:
1. Design module interface
2. Implement with best practices
3. Add variable validation
4. Generate documentation
5. Create examples
6. Set up testing

**Example Tasks**:
- "Create Azure networking module with hub-spoke pattern"
- "Build AWS ECS module with auto-scaling and ALB"
- "Develop GCP Cloud Run module with custom domains"

### 8. Migration Tasks

Migrate infrastructure to Terraform:

**Process**:
1. Inventory existing resources
2. Generate import commands
3. Create matching Terraform code
4. Validate configurations
5. Test import process
6. Plan cutover strategy

**Example Tasks**:
- "Import existing Azure resources into Terraform"
- "Migrate from CloudFormation to Terraform"
- "Convert ARM templates to Terraform HCL"

## Autonomous Behavior

- Include security best practices
- Have comprehensive variable validation
- Include meaningful descriptions
- Follow naming conventions
- Be version-compatible
- Include usage examples
- Have proper output definitions
