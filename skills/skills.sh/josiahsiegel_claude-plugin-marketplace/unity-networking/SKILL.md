# Unity Networking and Multiplayer

## Overview

Reference for implementing multiplayer systems and backend services in Unity. Covers the major networking frameworks, authority models, common multiplayer patterns, and Unity Gaming Services integration.

## Networking Framework Comparison

| Framework | Type | Best For | License |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| Netcode for GameObjects (NGO) | Client-hosted / Dedicated | Unity-native projects, UGS integration | Free (Unity) |
| Mirror | Client-hosted / Dedicated | Open-source alternative, mature ecosystem | MIT |
| Photon PUN 2 | Cloud-hosted | Quick prototyping, room-based games | Free tier + paid |
| Photon Fusion 2 | Cloud/Self-hosted | Competitive games, tick-based simulation | Free tier + paid |
| Fish-Net | Client-hosted / Dedicated | Performance-critical, Mirror alternative | MIT |

## Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)

### Setup

1. Install via Package Manager: `com.unity.netcode.gameobjects`
2. Add `NetworkManager` to a scene GameObject
3. Select transport (Unity Transport is default)
4. Mark networked prefabs with `NetworkObject` component
5. Register prefabs in NetworkManager's prefab list

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `NetworkManager` | Manages connections, spawning, scene management |
| `NetworkObject` | Required on all networked GameObjects |
| `NetworkBehaviour` | Base class for networked scripts (replaces MonoBehaviour) |
| `NetworkVariable<T>` | Synchronized variable with ownership/permissions |
| `NetworkTransform` | Automatic position/rotation sync |
| `NetworkAnimator` | Automatic Animator parameter sync |

### RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls)

```csharp
public class PlayerCombat : NetworkBehaviour
{
    NetworkVariable<int> _health = new(100,
        NetworkVariableReadPermission.Everyone,
        NetworkVariableWritePermission.Server);

    [ServerRpc]
    void AttackServerRpc(ulong targetId)
    {
        // Runs on server - validate and apply damage
        if (!IsServer) return;
        var target = NetworkManager.SpawnManager.SpawnedObjects[targetId];
        target.GetComponent<PlayerCombat>().TakeDamage(10);
    }

    [ClientRpc]
    void PlayHitEffectClientRpc(Vector3 position)
    {
        // Runs on all clients - visual feedback only
        Instantiate(hitVFX, position, Quaternion.identity);
    }

    void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        _health.Value -= amount;
        PlayHitEffectClientRpc(transform.position);
    }
}
```

| RPC Type | Direction | Use For |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `[ServerRpc]` | Client -> Server | Player actions, requests |
| `[ClientRpc]` | Server -> All Clients | VFX, sound, UI updates |
| `[ClientRpc(SendTo.Owner)]` | Server -> Owner Client | Owner-specific feedback |

### NetworkVariable Permissions

```csharp
// Server-writable (default) - authoritative state
NetworkVariable<int> score = new(0, writePerm: NetworkVariableWritePermission.Server);

// Owner-writable - client-authoritative (use sparingly)
NetworkVariable<Vector3> cursorPos = new(writePerm: NetworkVariableWritePermission.Owner);
```

Use `OnValueChanged` callback for UI reactions:
```csharp
_health.OnValueChanged += (oldVal, newVal) => healthBar.value = newVal;
```

## Authority Models

| Model | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Server-Authoritative | Server validates all actions, clients are thin | Competitive, anti-cheat critical |
| Client-Authoritative | Clients own their state, server relays | Cooperative, trust-based |
| Client Prediction + Server Reconciliation | Client predicts locally, server corrects | FPS, fast-paced action |
| Relay / Listen Server | One player hosts, others connect via relay | Casual, small lobbies |

### Server-Authoritative Flow

```text
Client: Press "Attack" -> Send ServerRpc(targetId)
Server: Validate range/cooldown -> Apply damage -> Update NetworkVariable
Server: Send ClientRpc for VFX
All Clients: Play hit effect
```

Never trust client data. Validate positions, cooldowns, ammunition, and line-of-sight on the server.

## Common Multiplayer Patterns

### Lobby System

```text
1. Player authenticates (UGS Auth / custom)
2. Player creates or joins lobby (UGS Lobby / custom)
3. Lobby fills -> host starts game
4. Relay allocation for NAT traversal (UGS Relay)
5. All players connect to relay
6. NetworkManager starts host/client
```

### Spawn and Despawn

```csharp
// Server-side spawning
var instance = Instantiate(prefab, spawnPoint, Quaternion.identity);
instance.GetComponent<NetworkObject>().SpawnWithOwnership(clientId);

// Server-side despawning
networkObject.Despawn(); // Removes from all clients
```

### Scene Management

Use `NetworkManager.SceneManager.LoadScene("GameScene", LoadSceneMode.Single)` for synchronized scene loading. Only the server/host should call this.

## REST API and WebSocket Integration

### REST API (UnityWebRequest)

```csharp
async Awaitable<T> GetAsync<T>(string url)
{
    using var request = UnityWebRequest.Get(url);
    request.SetRequestHeader("Authorization", $"Bearer {token}");
    await request.SendWebRequest();
    if (request.result != UnityWebRequest.Result.Success)
        throw new Exception(request.error);
    return JsonUtility.FromJson<T>(request.downloadHandler.text);
}
```

Use `JsonUtility` for simple types or Newtonsoft.Json (`com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`) for complex serialization. Always use `using` with UnityWebRequest to prevent memory leaks.

### WebSocket (NativeWebSocket / WebSocketSharp)

For real-time non-game communication (chat, notifications), use a WebSocket library. NativeWebSocket works across platforms including WebGL.

## Unity Gaming Services (UGS)

| Service | Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Authentication | `com.unity.services.authentication` | Anonymous/platform sign-in |
| Lobby | `com.unity.services.lobby` | Room creation, matchmaking |
| Relay | `com.unity.services.relay` | NAT traversal for P2P |
| Cloud Save | `com.unity.services.cloudsave` | Server-side player data |
| Leaderboards | `com.unity.services.leaderboards` | Ranked scoreboards |
| Economy | `com.unity.services.economy` | Virtual currencies, purchases |
| Analytics | `com.unity.services.analytics` | Player behavior tracking |
| Matchmaker | `com.unity.services.matchmaker` | Skill-based matchmaking |

Initialize UGS before using any service:
```csharp
await UnityServices.InitializeAsync();
await AuthenticationService.Instance.SignInAnonymouslyAsync();
```

## Firebase and PlayFab

Use Firebase for indie/mobile projects needing Realtime Database, Cloud Functions, and FCM push notifications. Use PlayFab for LiveOps-heavy games needing player segmentation, A/B testing, and automated rule processing. Both provide Unity SDKs via their respective download pages.
