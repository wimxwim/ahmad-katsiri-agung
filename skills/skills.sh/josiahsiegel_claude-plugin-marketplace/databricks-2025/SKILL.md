# Azure Data Factory Databricks Integration 2025

## Databricks Job Activity (Recommended 2025)

**CRITICAL UPDATE (2025):** The Databricks Job activity is now the **ONLY recommended method** for orchestrating Databricks in ADF. Microsoft strongly recommends migrating from legacy Notebook, Python, and JAR activities.

### Quick Reference

- **Activity type:** `DatabricksJob` (NOT `DatabricksSparkJob` or `DatabricksNotebook`)
- **Parameter property:** `jobParameters` (NOT `parameters`)
- **Linked service auth:** Managed Identity (`"authentication": "MSI"`) recommended
- **Cluster config:** Do NOT specify cluster properties in linked service; the Databricks Job controls compute

### Why Databricks Job Activity?

| Feature | Notebook Activity (Legacy) | Job Activity (2025) |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Compute | Must configure cluster in linked service | Serverless by default |
| Workflow tasks | Single notebook | Multi-task DAGs (notebook, Python, SQL, DLT) |
| Retry | ADF-level only | Job-level + task-level |
| Repair runs | Not supported | Rerun failed tasks only |
| Git integration | Limited | Full Databricks Git support + DABs |
| Lineage | None | Built-in data lineage |
| If/Else logic | Must use ADF control flow | Native If/Else task types |

### Benefits Summary

1. **Serverless Execution** -- No cluster specification needed; automatic serverless compute with faster startup and lower costs
2. **Advanced Workflow Features** -- Run As, Task Values, Conditional Execution, AI/BI Tasks, Repair Runs, Notifications, Queuing
3. **Centralized Job Management** -- Jobs defined once in Databricks workspace; single source of truth with Git-backed versioning
4. **Cost Optimization** -- Serverless compute (pay only for execution), job clusters (auto-terminating), spot instance support

## Connectors and Enhancements (2025+)

### ServiceNow V2 Connector (RECOMMENDED - V1 End of Support)

**ServiceNow V1 connector is at End of Support. Migrate to V2 immediately.**

| Feature | V1 | V2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Linked service type | `ServiceNow` | `ServiceNowV2` |
| Source type | `ServiceNowSource` | `ServiceNowV2Source` |
| Query builder | Custom | Aligns with ServiceNow condition builder |
| Performance | Standard | Enhanced extraction |
| OData support | No | Yes |

**Migration steps:** Update linked service type to `ServiceNowV2`, update source type to `ServiceNowV2Source`, test queries in ServiceNow UI condition builder, adjust timeouts.

### Enhanced PostgreSQL Connector

Improved performance with 2025 SSL enhancements: `enableSsl: true`, `sslMode: "Require"`.

### Enhanced Snowflake Connector

Improved performance with KeyPair authentication support and Key Vault secret integration.

### Managed Identity for Azure Storage

New managed identity support for Azure Table Storage and Azure Files connectors (system-assigned and user-assigned).

### Mapping Data Flows - Spark 3.3

Spark 3.3 now powers Mapping Data Flows with 30% faster processing, Adaptive Query Execution (AQE), dynamic partition pruning, improved caching, and better column statistics.

### Azure DevOps Server 2022 Support

Git integration now supports on-premises Azure DevOps Server 2022 via the `hostName` property.

For complete JSON examples of all connectors, see `references/connector-examples.md`.

## Managed Identity 2025 Best Practices

### User-Assigned vs System-Assigned

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Single ADF, simple setup | System-assigned |
| Multiple data factories | User-assigned (shared identity) |
| Complex multi-environment | User-assigned |
| Granular permission control | User-assigned |
| Identity lifecycle independence | User-assigned |

Use ADF's centralized **Credentials** feature to consolidate Microsoft Entra ID-based credentials across multiple linked services.

### MFA Enforcement (Enforced Since October 2025)

Azure MFA is mandatory for all interactive user logins. Impact on ADF:
- Managed identities are **UNAFFECTED** -- no MFA required for service accounts
- Service principals with certificate auth are the recommended alternative to secrets
- All interactive user logins require MFA

### Principle of Least Privilege

| Resource | Source Role | Sink Role |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Storage Blob | `Storage Blob Data Reader` | `Storage Blob Data Contributor` |
| SQL Database | `db_datareader` | `db_datareader` + `db_datawriter` |
| Key Vault | `Get` secrets only | `Get` secrets only |

For complete managed identity JSON examples, see `references/connector-examples.md`.

## Best Practices (2025)

1. **Use Databricks Job Activity (MANDATORY)** -- Stop using Notebook, Python, JAR activities. Define workflows in Databricks workspace with serverless compute.

2. **Managed Identity Authentication (MANDATORY)** -- Use managed identities for ALL Azure resources. Leverage Credentials feature for consolidation. MFA-compliant since October 2025.

3. **Monitor Job Execution** -- Track Databricks Job run IDs from ADF output, log parameters for auditability, set up alerts for failures, leverage built-in lineage.

4. **Optimize Spark 3.3 (Data Flows)** -- Enable AQE, use 4-8 partitions per core, broadcast joins for small dimensions, dynamic partition pruning.
