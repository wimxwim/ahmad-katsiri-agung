# Power BI Core Concepts and Data Modeling

## Overview

Core Power BI knowledge covering data modeling best practices, connectivity modes, source types, relationships, and common pitfalls. This skill provides the foundational architecture guidance every Power BI developer needs.

## Data Model Design - Star Schema

Always design data models using star schema topology:

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Fact table | Numeric events/transactions | Sales, Orders, WebVisits |
| Dimension table | Descriptive attributes | Date, Product, Customer, Geography |
| Bridge table | Many-to-many resolution | StudentCourse, OrderProduct |

**Mandatory rules:**
- One fact table at the center, dimensions radiating out
- Relationships flow from dimension (one side) to fact (many side)
- Use surrogate integer keys, not natural/business keys
- Keep fact tables narrow (keys + measures only)
- Denormalize dimensions (flatten snowflake into star)
- Create a dedicated Date dimension table (disable auto date/time)
- Never use bidirectional cross-filtering unless absolutely required and contained

## Storage Modes

| Mode | Data Location | Refresh | Performance | Use When |
|------|--------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Import | In-memory VertiPaq | Scheduled/on-demand | Fastest queries | Default choice, data under 1GB compressed |
| DirectQuery | Source database | Real-time | Depends on source | Real-time needed, data too large for import |
| Dual | Both | Scheduled + real-time | Best of both | Dimension tables in composite models |
| Direct Lake | OneLake delta tables | Framing (seconds) | Near-import speed | Fabric lakehouse/warehouse scenarios |

**Import mode considerations:**
- 1GB PBIX file size limit (10GB for Premium/PPU in service)
- Data is a snapshot at refresh time; not real-time
- Scheduled refresh limit: 8/day (Pro), 48/day (Premium/PPU)

**DirectQuery limitations:**
- No Power Query transformations applied at query time
- Single source per model (unless composite)
- Performance depends entirely on source query speed
- Many DAX functions unavailable or degraded
- No calculated columns on DirectQuery tables
- Row limit of 1 million rows per visual query

**Direct Lake key considerations (2025-2026 GA):**
- Two variants: Direct Lake on OneLake (DL/OL) and Direct Lake on SQL endpoints (DL/SQL)
- DL/OL does NOT fall back to DirectQuery -- queries fail if data cannot be served
- DL/SQL CAN fall back to DirectQuery via SQL analytics endpoint
- Guardrails vary by capacity: F32 allows up to 1,000 files/row groups per table; F64/P1 allows up to 5,000
- Max Memory is a soft limit for paging, not a hard guardrail -- excess paging hurts performance
- Max model size on disk/OneLake IS a hard guardrail -- exceeding causes DQ fallback (DL/SQL) or failure (DL/OL)
- Full DAX support including calculated columns
- Framing (metadata-only refresh) completes in seconds
- Power BI Embedded with Direct Lake mode is GA since March 2025

**Choosing storage mode decision tree:**
1. Data in Fabric OneLake delta tables? Use Direct Lake
2. Need real-time data, source is fast? Use DirectQuery
3. Data under 1GB, can tolerate refresh lag? Use Import (best performance)
4. Large data + need fast queries? Use composite model (Import dimensions + DQ facts + aggregation tables)

## Relationships

| Property | Options | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Cardinality | One-to-many, Many-to-one, One-to-one, Many-to-many | One-to-many |
| Cross-filter direction | Single, Both | Single |
| Active | Yes/No | Yes (only one active per path) |

**Relationship rules:**
- Only one active relationship between any two tables
- Use USERELATIONSHIP() in DAX to activate inactive relationships
- Avoid bidirectional filtering -- it causes ambiguous filter paths, performance degradation, and unexpected results
- Many-to-many requires a bridge table or composite model many-to-many cardinality
- Referential integrity: set "Assume Referential Integrity" for DirectQuery performance

## Data Sources Quick Reference

| Category | Sources |
|----------|---------|
| Microsoft SQL | SQL Server, Azure SQL, Azure Synapse, SQL Server Analysis Services |
| Azure | Cosmos DB, Data Explorer (Kusto), Blob Storage, Data Lake, Fabric Lakehouse/Warehouse |
| Cloud Databases | Snowflake, Databricks, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena |
| Files | Excel, CSV/TSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, PDF |
| Services | SharePoint, Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Google Analytics, Azure DevOps |
| Protocols | OData, REST API, ODBC, OLEDB |
| Streaming | Azure Stream Analytics, PubNub, REST API push |

## Incremental Refresh

Configure incremental refresh for large Import tables to avoid full refresh:

1. Create `RangeStart` and `RangeEnd` parameters (type DateTime) in Power Query
2. Apply filter on the date column using these parameters
3. Configure refresh policy: archive period (e.g., 3 years), incremental period (e.g., 30 days)
4. Optionally enable "detect data changes" with a last-modified column
5. Optionally enable real-time data with DirectQuery for the latest partition

**Requirements:** Premium, PPU, or Fabric capacity for more than basic incremental refresh. Pro workspaces support incremental refresh but with limitations.

**2025-2026 improvements:**
- Semantic models with incremental refresh can now be edited directly in Power BI Service (change calculated columns, rename tables, adjust hierarchies) without reopening Desktop
- Enhanced refresh API supports selective partition refresh for finer control
- Improved performance for terabyte-scale datasets with faster partition processing

## Gateway Configuration

On-premises data gateway bridges on-premises sources to Power BI Service:

| Gateway Type | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|
| Standard (enterprise) | Shared by multiple users, centrally managed |
| Personal | Single user, development/testing only |
| Virtual Network (VNet) | Azure VNet-connected sources, no on-prem hardware |

**VNet data gateway (2025-2026):**
- Connects to Azure data sources within a VNet without on-premises hardware
- Managed by Fabric/Power BI Service, no gateway machine maintenance
- Supports Azure SQL, Synapse, Azure Data Explorer, and other VNet-bound services
- Enable in Fabric Admin portal under gateway management

**Gateway releases (2025-2026):**
- Monthly releases throughout 2025-2026 with enhanced caching and query folding
- Improved query performance through optimized connection pooling
- 64-bit only for Power BI Desktop for Report Server starting September 2025

**Common gateway failures:**
- Credentials expired -- update in gateway settings
- Source unreachable -- check firewall, VPN, DNS
- Memory exhaustion -- monitor gateway machine resources
- Mashup engine crash -- check Power Query complexity

## Data Source Authentication

| Method | Use Case | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| OAuth2 | Cloud sources (Azure SQL, Snowflake, Databricks) | Interactive use, SSO |
| Service Principal | Automated refresh, CI/CD pipelines | Unattended operations |
| Workspace Identity | Fabric workspaces (no secret to manage) | Fabric-native models |
| Managed Identity | Dataflows Gen2 to Azure sources | Zero-secret PaaS access |
| Username/Password | Legacy on-prem sources | Gateway-bound sources |

**Workspace Identity (2025-2026):**
- Tied to a Fabric workspace, similar to Azure Managed Identity
- No expiration, no secret or password to manage
- Configure in workspace settings, assign to semantic model data sources
- Preferred over service principal for Fabric-native scenarios

**OAuth2 token limitation:** When set via REST API (not UI), OAuth2 credentials lack a refresh token and expire after 1 hour. Use service principal for long-running automation.

**Connection pooling best practices:**
- Gateway reuses connections where possible -- minimize distinct credential sets
- Set query timeout in data source settings (default 5 min, increase for complex queries)
- Implement retry logic in Power Query for transient source failures using `try/otherwise`

## Common Gotchas and Anti-Patterns

| Pitfall | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Auto date/time enabled | Hidden date tables bloat model (one per date column) | Disable in Options > Data Load |
| Implicit measures (drag numeric to visual) | No control over aggregation, no reuse | Create explicit DAX measures |
| Bidirectional cross-filter | Ambiguity, performance degradation, wrong results | Use single-direction, handle in DAX |
| Too many columns in fact tables | Bloated model, slow refresh, wasted memory | Keep facts narrow: keys + numeric values |
| BLANK vs 0 vs null confusion | DAX treats BLANK differently from 0; visuals hide BLANK rows | Use IF/COALESCE to handle explicitly |
| Circular dependency errors | Usually from calculated columns referencing each other or bidirectional filters | Restructure model, break the cycle |
| 1GB PBIX limit | Cannot save file locally | Remove unused columns, optimize cardinality |
| Power BI Service vs Desktop gap | Some features only available in one or the other | Check feature matrix before designing |
| Calculated columns vs measures | Calculated columns consume memory, stored per row | Prefer measures (computed at query time) |
| String columns in fact tables | High cardinality strings destroy VertiPaq compression | Move to dimension table, use key reference |
