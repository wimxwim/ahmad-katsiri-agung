# Unity GameDev Skill Pack

Use this skill to turn an external Unity skill pack into a **reviewed internal package**.

## When to use this skill
- You discovered an external Unity skill repository during survey runs.
- You want selective reuse (workflow ideas) rather than direct copy-paste.
- You need PR-safe imports with risk notes, provenance, and rollback.

## When not to use
- You need to debug a concrete Unity runtime/build error right now.
- You are writing gameplay code directly instead of curating skill docs.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Capture source provenance
Record at least one concrete source URL plus retrieval method (`indexed snippet` or `direct page retrieval`).

### Step 2: Extract reusable patterns only
From the source pack, keep transferable workflow units (setup checks, guardrails, validation order). Drop tool-locked fluff and unverifiable claims.

### Step 3: Run safety gates
Before adding any imported guidance:
- verify license suitability
- check recency/activity
- check that instructions are deterministic and non-destructive
- flag engine-version assumptions explicitly

### Step 4: Package into local skill structure
Create/update:
- `SKILL.md` (operator-facing workflow)
- `SKILL.toon` (compact behavior contract)
- `evals/evals.json` (prompt assertions that enforce boundaries)

### Step 5: Add risk + rollback in PR
State what was imported, what was intentionally excluded, known risks, and exact rollback path (revert commit/PR).

### Step 6: Validate before merge
Run JSON checks, diff hygiene (`git diff --check`), and skill validator scripts when available.

## Output format
Return a short curation packet:
- Source(s)
- Imported patterns
- Excluded patterns
- Risks
- Validation results

## Examples
- "Survey found `tjboudreaux/cc-plugin-unity-gamedev`; import only reusable setup/validation flow into local skill docs with risk notes."
- "Source license unclear after metadata fallback" -> keep as discovery evidence but do not promote/import without explicit exception rationale.

## Best practices
1. Prefer adaptation over replication: rewrite external guidance in local conventions.
2. Keep provenance labels near claims so reviewers can verify quickly.
3. Always include rollback steps in PR body when importing external workflows.
