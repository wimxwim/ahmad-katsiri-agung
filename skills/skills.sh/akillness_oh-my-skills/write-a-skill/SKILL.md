# Write a Skill

Create structured agent skills with proper documentation.

## When to use this skill

- Formalizing a workflow into a reusable, shareable skill
- Building new agent capabilities from scratch
- Documenting existing patterns so agents can discover and use them

## Critical design principle

> The description field is the only thing your agent sees when deciding which skill to load.

Write descriptions that:
- Clearly state what the skill does
- Include specific triggers: "Use when [context]"
- Have a 1024-character maximum
- Are precise enough that the agent knows whether to activate

## Process

### Phase 1 — Gather requirements

Understand:
- What task or workflow does this skill formalize?
- What are the trigger conditions (when should an agent activate this)?
- What are the boundaries (what does this skill NOT do)?
- What platforms should this work on?
- Does this overlap with existing skills?

### Phase 2 — Draft the skill

Create `SKILL.md` as the core file. Keep it under 100 lines.

Split into additional files when:
- SKILL.md exceeds ~100 lines
- Content covers distinct domains users won't always need
- Examples would clutter the core instructions

Supported supporting files:
- `REFERENCE.md` — detailed reference content
- `EXAMPLES.md` — concrete examples
- `scripts/` — deterministic utility scripts

### Phase 3 — Review with user

Present the draft. Validate:
- Description accurately triggers on the right requests?
- Instructions are clear and complete?
- Boundaries prevent misuse?
- Supporting files are needed or is SKILL.md sufficient?

## SKILL.md template (jeo-skills format)

# Skill Name

Brief intro paragraph.

## When to use this skill

- Condition 1
- Condition 2

## When not to use this skill

- Route-out 1 → use `other-skill`
- Route-out 2 → use `other-skill`

## Instructions

[Core instructions here]
```

## Quality checklist

- [ ] Description is under 1024 characters
- [ ] Description includes "Use when [context]" trigger language
- [ ] SKILL.md is under 100 lines (or has justified split)
- [ ] When-not-to-use routes out to specific skills
- [ ] metadata.tags covers discoverable keywords
- [ ] No implementation details in the description (that's what the body is for)

## Examples
- Example: Apply this skill to a small scope first, then scale to full scope after validation passes.

## Best practices
- Keep outputs deterministic and auditable.
- Prefer small reversible changes over broad risky edits.
- Record assumptions explicitly.
