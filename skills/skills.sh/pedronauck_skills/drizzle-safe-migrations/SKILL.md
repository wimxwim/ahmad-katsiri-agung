description: Production-safe Drizzle migration workflow for schema changes that require data backfills or constraint tightening. Use when changing enums/check constraints/defaults, removing status values, or sequencing custom and generated migrations in Drizzle. Trigger on requests about Drizzle migration safety, deployment-safe backfills, migration ordering, and rollback planning. Don't use for ORMs other than Drizzle, app-layer query optimization, or greenfield schema design.

# Drizzle Safe Migrations

## Overview

Use this skill to run database migrations in a way that is auditable, deployment-safe, and consistent with Drizzle's migration model.

## Core Rules

- Always generate schema migrations with the project script (`bun run db:generate`).
- Never hand-edit generated schema migration files.
- Generate data backfills as custom migrations (`bun run db:generate -- --custom --name <name>`) and edit only that custom SQL file.
- Apply data normalization before tightening constraints.
- Keep one-off data fixes in migration history, not as hidden runtime logic, unless an emergency hotfix requires temporary mitigation.

## Workflow

1. Classify the change:
   - `schema-only`: only column/table/index/default changes.
   - `data+schema`: old rows must be transformed before new constraints/defaults.
2. For `data+schema`, create custom migration first:
   - `bun run db:generate -- --custom --name <descriptive_name>`
   - Add idempotent backfill SQL.
3. Generate schema migration second:
   - `bun run db:generate`
4. Verify migration ordering in `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`:
   - backfill migration index must be lower than constraint-tightening migration index.
5. Verify generated SQL and snapshots:
   - backfill migration contains only intended data change.
   - schema migration contains constraint/default/type changes.
6. Run full backend verification:
   - `bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run test`
7. Document deployment notes:
   - expected data transformations,
   - lock-risk areas,
   - rollback strategy.

## Backfill Requirements

- Use restrictive `WHERE` clauses.
- Prefer idempotent updates (`UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'legacy_value'`).
- Do not mix unrelated DDL/DML in the same migration.
- Keep SQL explicit and minimal.

## Constraint Tightening Pattern

When removing allowed values (enum/check):

1. Backfill existing rows to valid target value.
2. Update default to new value.
3. Tighten check/enum constraint.

For large tables or strict uptime targets, use staged PostgreSQL patterns (`NOT VALID` + `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`) where applicable.

## Anti-Patterns

- Hand-editing generated schema migration files.
- Tightening constraints before backfilling existing data.
- Hiding one-time migration logic in app startup code without migration artifacts.
- Running migrations without validating order in the Drizzle journal.
