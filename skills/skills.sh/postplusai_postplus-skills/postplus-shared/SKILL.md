# PostPlus Shared

Use this skill first when another PostPlus skill asks for shared rules or shared workflow preferences.

This skill is the single source of truth for principle-level PostPlus skill documents. It is instruction-only: do not run provider runtimes, mutate public metadata or release metadata, or invent alternate execution paths from this shared-rule handoff.

## Default Workflow

1. Read the reference named by the downstream skill.
2. Apply the shared rule before reading platform- or production-specific details.
3. If a downstream skill and this shared rule conflict, fail fast and surface the conflict instead of inventing a fallback.
4. Keep executable work in the downstream skill or PostPlus CLI boundary; this shared skill only owns the principle-level rule.
