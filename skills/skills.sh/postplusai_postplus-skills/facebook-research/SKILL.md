# Facebook Research

Use this skill for public Facebook page, group, or post research through the
PostPlus hosted public-content collection surface.

Apply shared rulebook and user-guidance rules from `postplus-shared`.

## Before Collection Boundary

Confirm the task can be answered from public Facebook page, group, or post content.
If the goal requires follower, following, private audience, login-only,
or exhaustive audience data, stop and ask for a different source of truth.

## Collection Route

Default public Facebook targets:

- public page/profile URL -> recent public posts,
- public group URL -> recent public posts,
- direct public post URL -> one post,
- broad query -> small discovered public post set, then public content
  collection.

Map each public Facebook URL onto the matching released source key, then scrape
that source. The `--request` file is a JSON array of input records (one record per
public URL or query).

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED EXECUTION EXAMPLE -->
```bash
postplus research scrape facebook-group-posts --request request.json --output result.json
```
<!-- END GENERATED EXECUTION EXAMPLE -->

## Default Workflow

1. Confirm Facebook public source scope.
2. Compile a small page, group, post, or discovery brief.
3. Scrape the matching released source key. `postplus research scrape` returns
   either completed public post records or a pending result with `runHandle`.
   When pending, resume with
   `postplus research scrape --run-handle <runHandle> --output <result.json>`
   until the result is completed or failed.
4. Normalize or summarize public post facts without treating them as private
   audience exports.

## Output

Return source-grounded summaries, public post metrics when present, stable URLs
or ids, and clear notes about what the public collection cannot prove.

## Failure Modes

- Stop if the request includes non-Facebook platforms.
- Stop if no Facebook public URL or query can be used.
- Stop on hosted capability, auth, DNS, proxy, network, or malformed-output
  hard errors.
- Do not request private user data, login-only surfaces, or hidden audience
  exports.

## Handoff

Facebook summaries can feed `benchmark-to-brief`, campaign research, or broader
cross-platform synthesis. Publishing belongs in `social-media-publisher`.

## Public Command Boundary

- Choose the smallest matching command or workflow from the user input and run
  it directly.
- Readiness diagnostics: `postplus doctor --skill facebook-research`.
- If an owned CLI or script command fails, report the exact error and stop. Do
  not bypass the failure with metadata-only answers, readiness probing, local
  payload rewrites, fallback providers, or unpublished tools.
- Use `postplus research schema --json` only when constructing or repairing an unknown request shape.
- Public content scrape: `postplus research scrape <sourceKey> --request <input-array.json> --output <result.json>` (request = a JSON array of input records).
- Resume a pending public content scrape: `postplus research scrape --run-handle <runHandle> --output <result.json>`.
- Keep the first pass bounded; expand only after inspecting the first result.
- If the CLI returns a quote-confirmation challenge, run `postplus quote confirm --json --challenge-file <challenge.json>` and retry with the returned token.
