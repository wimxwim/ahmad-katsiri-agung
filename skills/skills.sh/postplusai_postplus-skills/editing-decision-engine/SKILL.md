# Editing Decision Engine

## Use When
- Plan short-form post-edit decisions from A-roll, B-roll, scripts, and reference videos. Use this when the goal is not generic video analysis or rendering, but deciding how to cut a social video beat by beat, including where to stay on face, where to insert proof B-roll, how to use reference patterns, and how to package an actionable edit plan for a human editor or downstream timeline tooling.

## Do Not Use When
- The task belongs to ideation, QA, or another released skill listed in the handoff section.
- Required inputs are missing and guessing would change the result.

## Required Input
- Explicit user brief or JSON input matching the artifact contract.

## Stop Conditions
- Stop when required user intent, source evidence, or owned input artifacts are
  missing and guessing would change the result.
- If an owned CLI or script command fails, report the exact error and stop. Do
  not bypass the failure with metadata-only answers, readiness probing, local
  payload rewrites, fallback providers, or unpublished tools.

## Handoff
- Return the structured output, hosted result, poll command, or explicit blocker.

## Public Command Boundary

- Choose the smallest matching command or workflow from the user input and run
  it directly.
- If an owned CLI or script command fails, report the exact error and stop. Do
  not bypass the failure with metadata-only answers, readiness probing, local
  payload rewrites, fallback providers, or unpublished tools.
