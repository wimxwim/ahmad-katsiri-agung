# Social Media Extractor

## Use When
- The user wants public Instagram or Facebook/Meta content signals for ad
  creative, benchmark, creator shortlist, UGC, or campaign asset planning.
- The user has not named a platform-specific workflow yet.

## Scope
- Instagram benchmark or creator shortlist work routes to Instagram skills.
- Facebook/Meta public page, group, or post evidence routes to
  `facebook-research`.
- Non-Meta platforms are outside this release lane.

## Do Not Use When
- The task belongs to ideation, QA, or another released skill listed in the handoff section.
- Required inputs are missing and guessing would change the result.

## Required Input
- Explicit user brief or JSON input matching the artifact contract.

## Stop Conditions
- Stop when required user intent, source evidence, or owned input artifacts are
  missing and guessing would change the result.
- If an owned CLI or script command fails, report the exact error and stop. Do
  not bypass the failure with metadata-only answers, readiness probing, local
  payload rewrites, fallback providers, or unpublished tools.

## Handoff
- Return the structured output, hosted result, poll command, or explicit blocker.

## Public Command Boundary

- Choose the smallest matching command or workflow from the user input and run
  it directly.
- If an owned CLI or script command fails, report the exact error and stop. Do
  not bypass the failure with metadata-only answers, readiness probing, local
  payload rewrites, fallback providers, or unpublished tools.
- This public skill is instruction-driven. Produce the artifact described by the workflow directly from the available evidence.
- Do not call private provider/runtime paths or unpublished local tools.
- If the CLI returns a quote-confirmation challenge, run `postplus quote confirm --json --challenge-file <challenge.json>` and retry with the returned token.
