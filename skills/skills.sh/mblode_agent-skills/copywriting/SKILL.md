# Copywriting

- **IS:** short conversion copy (landing pages, hero, subheads, CTAs, product descriptions, onboarding strings, email subjects); stripping AI writing tells from any copy.
- **IS NOT:** long-form articles or posts (use `blog-post`), slide or deck copy (use `presentation-creator`), API/product/reference docs (use `docs-writing`), or deciding which action exists, its scope, consequence, reversibility, or reachable states (use `product-design`; this skill writes final wording once those are decided).

Two modes, auto-detected (do not ask):

- Copy exists or user pasted copy to fix: **Mode B (Edit)**.
- Nothing written yet, or user wants something new: **Mode A (Write)**.
- Genuinely ambiguous ("improve this", no copy in scope): ask one question, then commit.

## Reference files

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `references/frameworks.md` | Pick a framework (Write Step 4); audit against the nine frameworks (Edit Step 3) |
| `references/page-types.md` | Copy norms for a known page type (Write Step 4) |
| `references/word-lists.md` | Flag Tier 1/2/3 AI vocabulary (Edit Step 4) |
| `references/ai-patterns.md` | Flag structural/sentence-level AI tells; P0/P1/P2 triage (Edit Step 4) |
| `references/sweeps.md` | Run the seven line-level sweeps (Edit Step 5) |
| `references/ui-states.md` | Name actions, write destructive CTAs, error/empty/loading-state copy |

## Mode A: Writing new copy

```
Writing progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Gather context
- [ ] Step 2: Lock the brief (hard gate)
- [ ] Step 3: Discover brand voice
- [ ] Step 4: Choose framework and load references
- [ ] Step 5: Write 2-3 alternatives
- [ ] Step 6: Recommend and explain
```

### Step 1: Gather context

Answer all four before writing; never invent audience or goal. Skip one only if files answer it unambiguously.

1. **Page purpose.** The one action this page drives (sign up, book a demo, download).
2. **Audience.** The specific reader: job title, pain, what they've already tried.
3. **Product.** What it does; the concrete user outcome.
4. **Traffic source.** Where the reader comes from (cold ad, warm email, organic search, referral).

Traffic source sets temperature: cold needs more Why; warm can lead with How or What.

### Step 2: Lock the brief (hard gate)

State the brief back and get explicit confirmation before writing:

```
Brief:
- Page: [page type]
- Goal: [single action]
- Reader: [specific audience]
- Core outcome: [what changes for the reader]
- Tone: [inferred from brand voice or user-stated]
- Traffic temperature: [cold / warm / hot]

Confirm this is correct before I write.
```

If they push back, update and re-confirm. Do not write until confirmed.

### Step 3: Discover brand voice

Find voice signals before inventing one; never default to generic corporate warmth.

- Read existing copy files, README headers, or marketing pages if accessible.
- Ask: "Do you have brand guidelines, a tone-of-voice doc, or existing copy I should match?"
- If nothing exists, infer from product and audience: B2B SaaS direct and confident, consumer apps warmer, developer tools terse and honest.

Note the inferred voice in the brief.

### Step 4: Choose framework and load references

Load `references/frameworks.md` and `references/page-types.md`. Choose the primary framework from the brief:

| Situation | Lead framework |
|-----------|---------------|
| Cold traffic, unfamiliar product | Why/How/What (Simon Sinek) |
| Feature-heavy product | Benefit Not Feature |
| High-trust audience, low awareness | Show Don't Tell |
| Transactional page, known intent | CTA Clarity |
| Long-form sales page | Problem → Agitate → Solution (PAS) |

Layer frameworks freely. Why/How/What almost always applies to hero copy.

### Step 5: Write 2-3 alternatives

Write exactly 2-3 distinct alternatives, labeled **Option A**, **Option B**, **Option C**. Each must:

- Apply the chosen framework visibly
- Lead with Why, not What
- Use no banned words (see below)
- Include a headline, subhead, and at least one CTA
- Be structurally different, not the same idea with new adjectives

### Step 6: Recommend and explain

Pick one; state which and why in one sentence. For each unpicked option, give one specific edit note: what would make it stronger.

---

## Mode B: Editing existing copy

```
Editing progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read all copy-bearing files
- [ ] Step 2: Set the north star
- [ ] Step 3: Audit against persuasion frameworks
- [ ] Step 4: Remove AI writing patterns
- [ ] Step 5: Run seven sweeps
- [ ] Step 6: Flag weakest elements with labels
- [ ] Step 7: Rewrite flagged sections
- [ ] Step 8: Output before/after diff
```

### Step 1: Read all copy-bearing files

Scan every reader-facing surface: README headers, landing components, hero, CTAs, product descriptions, feature lists, onboarding strings, meta descriptions, email subjects. Ask which files if unclear; never audit copy you haven't read in context.

### Step 2: Set the north star

Write one sentence before auditing: "[User] can now [do X] without [old pain]." Every flag and rewrite serves it. If you can't write it confidently, ask; the copy is unfixable until the value proposition is clear.

### Step 3: Audit against persuasion frameworks

Load `references/frameworks.md`. Check every major copy block against each framework. Identify the 3-7 highest-impact problems only; don't flag everything.

### Step 4: Remove AI writing patterns

Load `references/word-lists.md` and `references/ai-patterns.md`. Flag each AI-ism with `[AI-ISM]` plus its pattern type:

- **Tier 1 words** (`word-lists.md`): always flag and replace (delve, leverage, robust, seamless, paradigm, holistic, and more).
- **Tier 2 clusters** (`word-lists.md`): flag when 2+ appear in one paragraph (harness, empower, streamline, elevate, and more).
- **Structural patterns** (`ai-patterns.md`): formulaic openings, chatbot artefacts, "let's" transitions, significance inflation, copula avoidance, em dashes as ordinary punctuation.

The em dash (and `--` substitute) is itself a Tier 1 tell: cap at 1 per 1,000 words, zero is better. See `ai-patterns.md` section 1 for the rule, section 7 for P0/P1/P2 triage.

Skip for persuasion-only edits. If the user asked for AI pattern removal, run this first, before the sweeps.

### Step 5: Run seven sweeps

Load `references/sweeps.md`; run all seven in order. Each targets a distinct failure mode; don't skip any because copy "looks fine".

### Step 6: Flag weakest elements

Attach a label inline to every weak line. Use exactly these labels:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `[WHAT-NOT-WHY]` | Leads with product/feature, not user motivation |
| `[FEATURE-NOT-BENEFIT]` | Describes what the product has, not what changes for the user |
| `[TELL-NOT-SHOW]` | Adjective claim without proof ("powerful", "seamless", "easy") |
| `[VAGUE]` | Generic; could describe any product in the category |
| `[PASSIVE]` | Subject is acted upon instead of acting |
| `[DEAD-WEIGHT]` | Adds nothing not already conveyed; safe to cut |
| `[JARGON]` | Technical term that obscures meaning for non-experts |
| `[NO-PROOF]` | Claim needing a number, example, or testimonial |
| `[WEAK-CTA]` | CTA describes the action, not the outcome |
| `[STATE-COPY]` | Vague, leaky, or dead-end state string, or a destructive CTA labeled "Confirm"/"OK"/bare verb (see `references/ui-states.md` for rule IDs) |
| `[AI-ISM]` | AI writing pattern: Tier 1 word, Tier 2 cluster, or structural tell |

Flag the 3-7 weakest elements, prioritised by impact on conversion or comprehension.

### Step 7: Rewrite flagged sections

- Cut hard: a block that reads as already-tight usually isn't. Same meaning in half the words.
- Lead with Why (the user's problem or desire), not What (the product).
- Name the concrete outcome, not the capability.
- Replace adjectives with proof: "powerful analytics" becomes "see which pages kill signups".
- Make CTAs outcome-specific: "Start syncing" beats "Get started".
- Every sentence adds new information or gets cut.
- Never lengthen a CTA for clarity.
- When replacing AI-isms, rewrite the sentence; don't swap the flagged word for a synonym.

### Step 8: Output before/after diff

```markdown
## Copy Audit: [file or component name]

**North star:** [one-sentence value prop]

---

### [Section name]

**Before:**
> [original text]

**Issues:** `[LABEL]`, `[LABEL]`

**After:**
> [rewritten text]

**Why:** [one sentence explaining the change]

---

### Summary
- N issues flagged across N sections
- Top pattern: [most common label]
- Confidence: [high / medium; note if copy context was limited]
```

Verify each "After" line before handing back: leads with Why, names a concrete outcome, no banned word, no em dash as ordinary punctuation. A rewrite that reintroduces an AI tell is a regression.

---

## Banned words

Never write these; flag immediately in edit mode. Full replacement list in `references/word-lists.md`.

> delve, leverage (verb), robust, seamless, holistic, paradigm, game-changing, cutting-edge, innovative, synergy, revolutionary, effortless, world-class, powerful

Also ban **"simple"** as a claim ("our simple onboarding"): never earned upfront, reads as an unkept promise.

---

## Gotchas

- Confirm the brief before writing: without goal and value proposition, good-sounding copy solves the wrong problem.
- Edit mode: flag only the 3-7 highest-impact issues; over-flagging dilutes the audit.
- Read copy in context before judging; a vague-looking line may carry contrast with adjacent copy.
- Preserve the project's locale and brand voice; check existing copy before switching spelling or tone.
- Keep CTAs short; don't lengthen a label to explain the whole feature.
- Treat em dashes, Tier 1 AI words, and unearned "simple/easy/powerful/seamless" as immediate rewrite triggers.
- If CTAs aren't in markdown, ask where the component strings live before auditing.
