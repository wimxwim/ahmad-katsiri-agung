  Monitors an open PR, detects it from the current branch, polls for conflicts,
  CI failures, review comments, and merge readiness, fixes safe issues, and
  reports only state changes. Monitor mode requires CronCreate/CronDelete;
  without them, run one-shot modes only. Use when asked to "babysit a PR",
  "watch this PR", "keep a PR green", "fix CI", "why is CI red", "resolve
  conflicts", "triage review comments", or "address PR comments". For PR
  creation use pr-creator; for diff review use pr-reviewer; for npm releases
  use autoship.

# PR Babysitter

- **IS:** autonomous monitoring of an open PR (conflicts, CI across GitHub Actions/Buildkite/Vercel/Fly.io, review comments, merge readiness) with auto-fixes, plus one-shot CI diagnosis or conflict resolution.
- **IS NOT:** creating the PR (use `pr-creator`), reviewing the diff for bugs (use `pr-reviewer`), or npm release pipelines (use `autoship`, which watches its own release CI; never babysit a release or Version Packages PR that autoship is driving).

## Mode Selection

| Invocation | Mode |
|------------|------|
| "babysit", "watch this PR", "monitor", "keep it green" | Monitor: Phase 1 once, then phases 2-5 on every cron tick |
| "fix CI", "why is CI red", "CI is broken", "loop on CI" | One-shot Phase 3 loop, no cron |
| "resolve conflicts", "fix conflicts" | One-shot Phase 2, no cron |
| "triage review comments", "address the comments" | One-shot Comment Triage Workflow, no cron |

Rules for every mode:

- No setup questions: auto-detect the PR, platforms, and defaults, start immediately. Overrides arrive inline only ("poll every 5 minutes", "enable auto-merge").
- CronCreate/CronDelete unavailable: do not claim monitor mode is active. Run the matching one-shot mode, or tell the user this runtime cannot keep polling.
- Skip closed or merged PRs. Skip drafts unless the user explicitly asks.
- Comment triage runs autonomously inside the cycle, no plan approval gate.

## Reference Files

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `references/monitoring-setup.md` | Monitor start: CronCreate config, state file format, defaults |
| `references/merge-conflicts.md` | Phase 2: mergeStateStatus table, rebase workflow, auto-resolvable file types |
| `references/ci-platforms.md` | Phase 3: per-platform log/retry commands, Buildkite auth fallback, failure classification, stale-dependency and `knip` handling |
| `references/github-api.md` | Comment triage: GraphQL queries to fetch, reply to, resolve threads |
| `references/bot-patterns.md` | Comment triage: bot detection, severity parsing, deduplication, false-positive rules |
| `references/fix-plan-template.md` | Comment triage: audit-trail plan format |
| `references/verification-gate.md` | Before any commit/push: lint, type-check, test, `knip` gate, stray-artifact sweep |
| `references/git-resilience.md` | Any git command hangs or fails transiently (fsmonitor wedge, stale index.lock, IPC blip) |

## Monitor Loop

Phase 1 runs once in the foreground and registers the cron job. Each tick runs phases 2-5, diffing against the previous tick's state file; only transitions produce output, a quiet poll says nothing.

Copy this checklist to track progress:

```
PR babysit progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Initialize (auto-detect PR, snapshot state, start cron)
- [ ] Phase 2: Conflict check (detect and resolve merge conflicts)
- [ ] Phase 3: CI/CD check (poll checks, diagnose failures, fix and push)
- [ ] Phase 4: Comment check (detect new comments, triage autonomously)
- [ ] Phase 5: Readiness check (evaluate merge readiness, notify user)
```

### Phase 1: Initialize

Load `references/monitoring-setup.md` for CronCreate config and defaults.

1. **Auto-detect the PR**: `gh pr view --json number,url,title,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision`. If a PR number was passed, use it. No PR for the branch: say so and stop.
2. **Extract owner/repo**: `gh repo view --json owner,name`
3. **Detect CI platforms** from `gh pr checks` check names (dispatch table in Phase 3)
4. **Create cron job**: CronCreate with `*/2 * * * *` running phases 2-5; capture the job ID.
5. **Snapshot state** to `.claude/scratchpad/babysit-pr-{N}.md`: Cron Job ID, HEAD SHA, mergeable status, check statuses, unresolved thread count, review decision.
6. **Print confirmation**:

```
Monitoring PR #{N}: {title}
Polling every 2 minutes | Auto-resolve noise: yes | Auto-merge: no
Detected CI: {platforms}
Cron job: {job_id}
Current state: {mergeable} | {reviewDecision} | {check_summary}
```

### Phase 2: Conflict Check

Load `references/merge-conflicts.md` for the mergeStateStatus table and resolution strategy.

1. **Check mergeable**: `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`
   - `MERGEABLE`, up to date → skip to Phase 3
   - `CONFLICTING` → resolve
   - `UNKNOWN` → GitHub still computing; recheck next tick
2. **Rebase**: `git fetch origin {base_branch} && git rebase origin/{base_branch}`
   - clean → `git push --force-with-lease` → notify
   - conflicts only in safe files (lockfiles, generated, changelogs) → auto-resolve per the reference, push
   - logic conflicts in source → `git rebase --abort` → notify with the conflicting files and each side's change

Never push with bare `--force`. A failed `--force-with-lease` means someone else pushed: abort and notify, do not overwrite their commits. If `git fetch` or `git rebase` hangs, see `references/git-resilience.md`.

### Phase 3: CI/CD Check

Load `references/ci-platforms.md` for per-platform commands, the Buildkite auth fallback chain, and the failure-classification decision tree.

1. **Poll**: `gh pr checks --json name,state,conclusion,detailsUrl`
2. **Classify each check**: passing, pending (wait for completion before diagnosing), or failing
3. **All passing** → proceed to Phase 4
4. **Failing** → dispatch on check name to fetch logs:

| Check name / detailsUrl | Platform | Failure logs via |
|-------------------------|----------|------------------|
| `buildkite/` prefix | Buildkite | Auth fallback chain: `bk` CLI, then REST API, then detailsUrl |
| `vercel` in name or `vercel.com` in URL | Vercel | `vercel logs {deployment_url}` |
| `fly-` prefix or `fly.io` in URL | Fly.io | `flyctl logs --app {app_name} --no-tail` |
| Anything else | GitHub Actions | `gh run view {run_id} --log-failed` |

5. **Classify the failure** per the decision tree: flaky (re-run), stale dependency (reinstall/rebuild before touching source), code error (fix), `knip` (remove dead code or configure), infrastructure (notify; not fixable from code)
6. **Fix, gate, push**: run the verification gate (`references/verification-gate.md`) locally before pushing
7. **Compare with previous state**: flag regressions (was passing, now failing)

**One-shot loop ("fix CI"):** after pushing, run `gh pr checks --watch`; re-diagnose if still red. Exit when checks go green (report it), the failure is infrastructure, or the same check fails twice with the same error after a fix; then summarize instead of thrashing.

### Phase 4: Comment Check

1. **Count unresolved threads**: GraphQL count via `references/github-api.md`
2. **Compare with the state file**. New unresolved threads since last tick → notify "N new review comments on PR #{N}", then run the Comment Triage Workflow
3. **Auto-resolve noise**: resolve unambiguous noise bots (vercel, linear, changeset linkbacks) with a one-line reason. Never auto-resolve human comments or critical/major findings

### Phase 5: Readiness Check

1. **Ready** = all of: `mergeable == MERGEABLE`, all required checks passing, `reviewDecision == APPROVED`, zero unresolved blocking threads
2. **Ready** → notify: "PR #{N} is ready to merge. All checks green, reviews approved, no conflicts." Do not merge; auto-merge requires explicit opt-in
3. **Not ready** → report blockers: "Waiting on: 2 checks pending" / "Blocked by: merge conflict"
4. **Notify only on transitions**: check went green/red, new review, conflict appeared/cleared, all clear
5. **Write the state file** for the next tick to diff against

## Comment Triage Workflow

Runs inline when Phase 4 finds comments, or one-shot when invoked directly. No plan approval; the plan file is an audit trail.

Load `references/github-api.md` for query templates and `references/bot-patterns.md` for detection rules.

### Fetch

1. **Review threads (inline line comments)**: paginated GraphQL `reviewThreads` query; filter to `isResolved == false`. Read every thread's inline `comments` bodies with their `path:line`. These carry the actual findings from any reviewer (human or bot), often when the review-level body is empty. Never triage on the review body alone, and never skip a reviewer's inline comments because of who posted them
2. **PR reviews**: REST reviews endpoint (state, body, author)
3. **Issue-level comments**: REST PR conversation comments endpoint
4. **Early exit** if zero unresolved threads, actionable reviews, and actionable issue comments

### Classify

1. **Author type**: human or bot. Classify bots by content first, then username (`github-actions[bot]` is shared)
2. **Skip noise** per the bot-patterns reference
3. **Severity**: parse bot markers; humans default Major for `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, Minor for `APPROVED` plus a question
4. **Deduplicate**: comments on the same file within a 3-line range are one issue; keep the highest severity. Never for human comments
5. **Disposition**: category, severity, confidence, then fix or ignore with a stated reason

Human comments are never auto-ignored. Classify as fix unless already resolved or the reviewer marked it optional.

### Fix

1. **Write the plan** to `.claude/scratchpad/pr-{N}-review-plan.md` per `references/fix-plan-template.md` (the audit trail)
2. **Print counts** (N to fix, K conversation items, M ignored) and proceed immediately
3. **Resolve ignored threads**: brief reply, then resolve via GraphQL
4. **Fix real issues** grouped by commit group; parallelize independent file fixes
5. **Gate, commit, push**: the verification gate (`references/verification-gate.md`) must pass; sweep stray artifacts (e.g. a root `schema.gql` from a hook); one commit per logical group, staging only that group's files
6. **Reply and resolve** each fixed thread via GraphQL
7. **Verify**: re-fetch threads; report zero unresolved (or list what remains) plus current CI status

## Stopping

- "Stop babysitting" / "cancel the PR monitor" → CronDelete with the job ID from the state file
- PR merged or closed → detected on the next tick, self-cancel
- Session exit → jobs are session-scoped, auto-clean

On stop, report a final summary: total polls, fixes applied, conflicts resolved, comments triaged, current state.

## Gotchas

- Setup questions before starting: defeats autonomous monitoring. Auto-detect, apply defaults, start.
- `git push --force` instead of `--force-with-lease`: silently overwrites a teammate's commits. Failed lease = someone pushed; abort and notify.
- Auto-resolving or auto-ignoring human comments: reviewers re-open them and lose trust. Humans classify as fix unless marked optional.
- Resolving a thread without a reply first: the reviewer sees a silent resolve and unresolves it.
- Fixing items the triage classified as ignore: churn nobody asked for; contradicts the audit trail.
- One commit per individual comment: unreadable review history. Group related fixes by commit-group label.
- Pushing before the verification gate (lint, type-check, test, `knip`) passes locally: a red push wastes the poll cycle plus a CI run.
- Committing stray hook artifacts (e.g. a root `schema.gql`): pollutes the PR diff. Sweep `git status --porcelain`, stage only the fix's files.
- Treating a monorepo type-check failure as a code bug: often stale deps or generated types. Reinstall and rebuild first; edit source only if it persists.
- Aborting the monitor on one hung or transient git command: fsmonitor wedges and stale locks are recoverable (`references/git-resilience.md`). Retry first.
- Re-diagnosing while checks are still pending: you fix the wrong thing on a half-finished run. Wait for completion.
- Polling faster than every 2 minutes: burns GitHub API rate limit for no signal. 2 minutes is the floor.
- Notifying on every poll with no state change: fatigue trains the user to ignore the monitor. Only transitions speak.
- Auto-merging without explicit opt-in: merge is a one-way door. "Ready to merge" is a notification, not an action.
- Classifying `github-actions[bot]` as always noise: shared identity used by DangerJS, schema checkers, and other reviewers. Classify by content.
- Using `bk` CLI without checking `bk auth status` first: Keychain tokens expire; a dead token stalls the cycle. Fall back to the REST API or `gh pr checks`.

## Related Skills

- `pr-creator`: opens the PR; babysitting starts after it exists
- `pr-reviewer`: local diff review for bugs; run it on monitor-authored fixes beyond a trivial patch
- `autoship`: npm release pipelines; it watches its own release CI, so never babysit a release PR it drives
