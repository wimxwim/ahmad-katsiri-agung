description: >-
  Audits built React and Next.js frontends for user-facing defects in code and
  rendered UI: state gaps, data loss, double submits, focus and keyboard
  failures, rollback gaps, stale async, accessibility markup, layout
  resilience, performance setup, typography, motion hazards, and microcopy.
  Returns file:line findings and a ship verdict. Use when asked to "review this
  PR for UX bugs", "audit this component", "check my UI", "is this accessible",
  "design QA this page", or "is this ready to ship". For product decisions use
  product-design; for agentic apps use ax-audit; for deep type or motion use
  typography-audit or ui-animation.

# UI Audit

Audits the **built frontend** at the **feature level** (checkout, onboarding, a dashboard) for a dev with a PR open: "**which of these hurt users in production, and which are nice-to-haves?**" Reasons about code behavior (React/Next source) and rendered quality (accessibility, layout, performance, type, motion).

- **IS:** a diff-aware reviewer that detects which feature each changed file implements, runs that feature's playbook across behavior, rendered-quality, and Laws of UX rules, and emits a 3-tier ship verdict with `file:line` evidence and fixes.
- **IS NOT:** the product decision of what *should* exist (right interaction, action naming, reachable states → `product-design`), an agentic-app review (tool parity, trust cues, approval gates → `ax-audit`), a deep typography or motion pass (→ `typography-audit` or `ui-animation`), or a re-implementation of Lighthouse/axe/Chromatic (→ see "Defer to other tools").

## product-design or ui-audit?

The dispatch signal is the artifact, not the topic. Both care about states and interaction, but act at different moments.

| You have... | The question is | Use |
|---|---|---|
| A brief, spec, mockup, intent, or a UI you decide *about* | What should exist: the right interaction, the action's name, which states *should* be reachable | `product-design` |
| Code, a diff, or a running UI you decide *on* | Is the built result right: states covered, accessible, renders and behaves correctly, ready to ship | `ui-audit` |

Often both in sequence: `product-design` decides the states that must exist, `ui-audit` verifies the built code implements them.

## Audit workflow

Copy and track this checklist:

```text
UI Audit progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Determine scope (PR diff via `git diff --name-only main` OR explicit file/folder)
- [ ] Step 2: Detect features in scope (sign-in / checkout / form / modal / list / dashboard / ...)
- [ ] Step 3: For each feature, run its playbook from references/feature-playbooks.md in order
- [ ] Step 4: For each check, load the named rule file (rules-modern/, rules-surface/, or rules/) and run its detection
- [ ] Step 5: Assign each finding a ship tier per references/ship-readiness.md (surface can bump tiers)
- [ ] Step 6: Build the JSON document, then render with the chosen output adapter
- [ ] Step 7: Run the audit-self-check; report INCOMPLETE if it fails
```

Step notes:

1. **Scope.** Diff by default; never the whole codebase (see [Scope](#scope-diff-aware-by-default)).
2. **Detect features.** Match semantics + filenames + routes: `<form>` with email + password is sign-in; `role="dialog"` is a modal; `/checkout` is checkout. Table: `references/feature-playbooks.md`.
3. **Run playbooks.** Each feature has 5-7 ordered checks. Run every one even when you expect a pass; passes feed the self-check's `rulesRun` count.
4. **Load rules.** Only the rule files the playbook names, never a whole folder (see [dispatch](#rule-layers-and-dispatch)).
5. **Tier.** Every finding gets `release-blocker | fix-this-sprint | backlog`; surface context bumps the default tier (sign-in/checkout up; marketing/internal-admin down).
6. **Render.** JSON first, then the adapter: the JSON keeps findings comparable across runs.
7. **Self-check.** Terminal evidence step; criteria below.

## Rule layers and dispatch

Four layers, each with its own loading condition. Load rule files individually, on demand:

| Layer | Location | Load when | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1: Feature playbooks | `references/feature-playbooks.md` | Always, at Step 2, since it is the entry point that names which Layer 2/3/4 rules to run | 12 playbooks |
| 2: Modern failure modes (behavior) | `rules-modern/<category>-<slug>.md` | A playbook check names the rule, or a changed file matches the rule's category (forms, states, async, focus, mobile, dark-i18n, microcopy) | 31 rules |
| 3: Rendered quality (surface) | `rules-surface/<prefix>-<slug>.md` | A playbook check names the rule, or a surface needs a rendered-quality check (a11y, interaction, forms, type, nav, layout, perf, motion, copy) | 34 rules |
| 4: Laws of UX | `rules/<prefix>-<slug>.md` | A playbook explicitly names a Laws rule, or a finding needs cognitive/perceptual reasoning no Layer 2/3 rule covers | 30 rules (20 programmatic, 10 rubric) |

Layer-specific notes:

- **Layer 2 (behavior) reasons from React/Next source:** state coverage, form data loss, async races, focus management, optimistic-rollback, dark-mode/i18n. Index: `rules-modern/_sections.md`; summaries + default tiers: `references/modern-failure-modes.md`. Each rule file: detection greps, false-positive guards, surface-tier overrides, before/after fix.
- **Layer 3 (rendered quality) reasons from rendered output:** accessibility markup, keyboard operability, layout resilience, performance, motion, surface typography, copy specificity. Index + per-rule impact: `rules-surface/_sections.md`. A rule's frontmatter impact wins over its category default (e.g. `perf-image-dimensions-and-priority` is CRITICAL inside the HIGH `perf-` category).
- **Layers 2 and 3 are complementary, not redundant:** for a form, Layer 2 catches data loss on validation, Layer 3 catches a missing label or 14px mobile input. Run both when a feature has both in scope.
- **Layer 4 is reserve.** Expect 1-2 Laws findings per audit, not 30. Index: `rules/_sections.md`. The 10 rubric-kind rules score 1-5 against anchor tables in `references/observational-rubrics.md`: emit the score plus the verbatim anchor text.
- **When multiple layers fire on one issue, keep the most concrete framing.** "Missing error state" (Layer 2) beats "Postel's Law violation" (Layer 4): concrete fix, specific surface match.

## Scope: diff-aware by default

```bash
git diff --name-only main -- '*.tsx' '*.jsx' '*.ts' '*.js' '*.css' '*.module.css'
```

Audit only those files; surface the base in output: `Auditing: 8 files changed vs main`.

- Single component: `git diff --name-only HEAD -- src/Component.tsx`
- Full sweep: only on explicit request (`--full src/`), e.g. introducing the skill to a codebase. A default full sweep buries the 3 findings that matter under 60 that don't.

## Ship-readiness verdict

Every audit opens with a verdict block before per-finding detail:

```text
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SHIP VERDICT: ❌ NOT READY (1 release-blocker)

Surface count:           3 (CheckoutForm, PaymentStep, ConfirmStep)
Findings:                7
  Release blockers:      1   ⛔  Form data loss on validation (PaymentStep.tsx:42)
  Fix this sprint:       3   ⚠️
  Backlog:               3   📋

Defer-to (not audited here):
  Measured CWV (lab):    Run Lighthouse
  Bundle size:           Run size-limit
  Full WCAG conformance: Run axe-core
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Verdict computation: ✅ READY (0 blockers, ≤3 sprint) · ⚠️ READY WITH FOLLOW-UP (0 blockers, ≥4 sprint) · ❌ NOT READY (≥1 blocker) · 🚫 INCOMPLETE (self-check failed). Tier definitions, surface bump rules, and worked examples: `references/ship-readiness.md`.

## Output adapters

All three formats render from the same JSON document. Templates and field mappings: `references/output-adapters.md`; strict schema: `references/output-schema.md`.

| Adapter | When | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal table | Local dev, agent chat | Tight table grouped by surface, tier-sorted |
| PR comment | GitHub / Vercel review | Markdown summary + inline comments with `suggestion` blocks |
| CI JSON | Pipelines, merge gates | Strict JSON; gate with `jq -e '.summary.releaseBlockers == 0'` |

## Suppressions

A finding is suppressed with an inline comment whose slug matches the rule:

```tsx
{/* ui-audit-ignore:focus-not-restored, intentional: parent owns focus */}
<Dialog open={open} onClose={onClose}>
```

Suppressed findings still appear in the summary (`summary.suppressed`) so reviewers can verify intent.

## Defer to other tools

ui-audit reasons statically; it does not measure runtime metrics or replace conformance scanners. It does surface-level a11y and performance checks (alt text, labels, contrast cues, image dimensions, font loading) but defers comprehensive measurement. When a finding belongs to another tool, link out, don't restate:

| Concern | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Measured Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) | Lighthouse + web-vitals |
| Full WCAG conformance scan | axe-core / eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y |
| Visual regression | Chromatic / Percy |
| Bundle size budgets | size-limit / bundle-analyzer |
| Generic correctness bugs | CodeRabbit / Vercel Agent / `pr-reviewer` |

Full coverage map plus the gaps only ui-audit catches: `references/defer-to-other-tools.md`.

## Related skills

- `product-design`: the product decision, not the build. Route there when the question is "is this the right interaction or set of states", on a brief, spec, mockup, or intent.
- `ax-audit`: agentic-feature PRs (agent dashboards, tool-use UIs, trust patterns). Run both on an agentic feature: ax-audit for the agent layer, ui-audit for the surfaces around it.
- `pr-reviewer`: correctness bugs and code quality in the same diff; ui-audit covers only user-facing quality and behavior.
- `typography-audit`: deep typography (pairing, OpenType systems, brand and display type); ui-audit's `type-` rules and typography sweep are the shallower check.
- `ui-animation`: motion implementation and review (springs, easing, gestures); ui-audit's `motion-` findings route here for the fix.

## Gotchas

- **Don't audit the whole codebase by default.** Full sweeps need an explicit request; otherwise the noise floor hides release-blockers.
- **Don't skip feature detection and run every rule on every file.** 95 rules × N files is a wall of backlog nits; per-feature playbook checks produce signal. Load only the `rules-modern/`, `rules-surface/`, `rules/` files the playbook names.
- **Don't assign `release-blocker` liberally.** Reserve it for data loss, broken critical paths, and dark patterns. If everything is a blocker, the verdict stops gating merges.
- **Don't prescribe fixes without the matching React 19 API.** "Add a loading state" is unactionable; "wrap in `<Suspense fallback={<InvoiceListSkeleton />}>`" gets applied.
- **Don't render markdown before the JSON document is complete.** Adapters project the JSON; skipping it loses `defaultTier`/`assignedTier`/`tierReason` and makes runs incomparable.
- **Don't double-report one issue across layers.** When Layers 2, 3, and 4 all touch one issue, keep only the most concrete framing; emitting all inflates the count and splits the fix. Layers 2 and 3 catching *different* issues on one feature (data loss vs missing label) is expected, not a duplicate.
- **Don't report a rendered-quality rule at its category default when the frontmatter overrides it.** `perf-image-dimensions-and-priority` is CRITICAL (CLS) even though `perf-` is a HIGH category.
- **Don't quote lawsofux.com verbatim.** It is CC BY-NC-SA; every Layer 4 rule paraphrases. Quoting contaminates the output's license.
- **Don't fabricate detections.** No grep/Read evidence → `result: "unknown"` with a `reason`, never a `fail`. The self-check flags audits with >30% unknowns.

## Audit self-check

Self-flag the audit `INCOMPLETE` if any are true:

- Fewer rules ran than planned (`rulesRun < rulesPlanned`)
- Over 30% of executed rules returned `unknown`
- Any fail/warn finding lacks a `file:line` citation
- Any fail/warn finding lacks a `fix` (and, where mechanical, a `fixSnippet`)
- No Read or Grep tool calls between findings (audit was guessed, not run)
- Every finding landed in the same tier (suspect blanket assignment)
