# Dataplex And BigQuery Governance

## Overview

Use this skill when governance on `GCP` is centered on `Dataplex`, `BigQuery`, and related Google Cloud metadata controls. It helps agents define governance zones, policy-tag boundaries, lineage expectations, and trusted publishing patterns for warehouse and lake platforms.

## When to Use

- designing `Dataplex` lakes, zones, or governance domains
- defining `BigQuery` policy tags and governed publish boundaries
- improving metadata quality, lineage, and discovery on `GCP`
- aligning warehouse and lake governance across `Cloud Storage`, `BigQuery`, `Dataflow`, and `Dataproc`
- making governed analytics delivery work with regional or regulated-data controls

Do not treat `BigQuery` governance as only a permissions problem. Trusted publishing also needs metadata, ownership, and policy boundaries.

## Workflow

1. Define the governance boundary.
   Decide:
   - lakes and zones
   - datasets and domains
   - producer versus consumer boundaries
   - ownership expectations

2. Define metadata and policy controls.
   Include:
   - policy tags
   - classifications
   - lineage coverage
   - discovery metadata
   - trusted versus exploratory asset signaling

3. Align lake and warehouse governance.
   Make explicit how `Cloud Storage`, `BigQuery`, and processing services fit the same control model.

4. Design governed publish behavior.
   Require:
   - clear serving boundaries
   - ownership visibility
   - release or validation evidence where needed
   - rules for schema and policy change

5. Validate day-2 operations.
   Review whether onboarding, schema evolution, and new domains remain manageable under the governance model.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "Policy tags are the whole governance design." | Tags help, but they do not replace ownership, zone design, trusted publishing, or metadata quality. |
| "Dataplex is only for lake governance." | Many teams need a joined governance model across storage, warehouse, and processing surfaces. |
| "Discovery will happen automatically once assets are scanned." | Useful discovery requires curated metadata and trust signals. |

## Red Flags

- lake, dataset, and domain boundaries are inconsistent
- policy tags exist without ownership or publish context
- warehouse and lake governance behave differently with no clear rule
- certification or trusted-asset behavior is missing
- schema and policy changes are operationally unclear

## Verification

- [ ] Governance boundaries are explicit across lake and warehouse surfaces
- [ ] Policy tags, metadata, and lineage expectations are defined
- [ ] Publish behavior is governed and reviewable
- [ ] Ownership and discovery expectations are visible
- [ ] Day-2 operations fit the governance design
